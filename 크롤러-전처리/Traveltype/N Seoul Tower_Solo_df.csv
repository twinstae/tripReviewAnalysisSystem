0,5.0,"If your in Seoul you should visit the N Tower. The view is very fantastic,  you can see the city lights on the top, its nice to visit during evening.  They also have restaurant there in case your hungry and you want to enjoy the view while eating."
1,4.0,"There is LED tunnel, Love Lock area, and also the observatory deck. It is best to go with lover. Easy to go there by bus or cable car."
2,4.0,"The tower is a place to observe the city. You can choose to go up by walking the park, take a cable car or by bus. The canke car will cost you about 7000₩ one way or about 10000₩ return."
3,5.0,"A well recommended hike from the Grand Hyatt Seoul to the Tower.   Excellent for all ages, especially families."
4,4.0,"I visit towers in every city I travel to, so Seoul was no different. However, it took a lot of effort to get up there. The easiest way is to take the metro to Myeongdong station, walk 10-15 minutes to the Namsan Oreumi elevator to get to the cable car station. Even once you get off the cable car, there are about 100+ stairs to climb. There are separate entry tickets for the cable car and the tower. Get there before sunset, to get great day and night views of the surrounding city."
5,3.0,"Well, it’s a landmark and yes you should see it but I felt a bit let down as I expected more... it’s not bad, but surprisingly little things to see or do for the schlepp...."
6,5.0,"I took a night tour bus to here and we only had 30 minutes to take pictures at this place.  I was not able to get to the top of the tower because of the time limit, however, the view I did see was fabulous. The mountain is steep and it is best to walk up it slowly if you aren't used to walking up mountains.  Though I had no time to get to the top, I enjoyed the view I could see.  There are many tourists on this mountain and everybody is camera and selfie happy, so you may have to wait to take photos at different sites.  This was worth coming too, even if you cannot make it to the top."
7,4.0,Took a bus from Seoul station to tower. Must visit place in Seoul as you can have the 360 degrees whole city view. Bought ticket from klook and redeem it at kiosk outside the entrance with ease.
8,5.0,"I had tried to go to N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and the queue was so long it would have taken at least 2 hours to get up, plus it was rainy. Instead I went back the next day and not only was it better weather and almost no queue, but they didn’t make me buy a new ticket and even offered to refund my ticket from the previous day. I went up the little elevator to the cable car, where there was free entertainment I did not expect to see. From there I visited the Hello Kitty museum which is small but so cute. Then I got in the elevator to the top of the tower. There are cool projections on the way up, making it feel like you’re shouting into space. The view from the tower is incredible.A super fun day out, and really reasonably priced."
9,4.0,"Well worth it. Awesome views!A short walk from Myeongdong, where I stayed. I took the cable car up and walked down."
10,5.0,"I went at night time and bought a 1 way ride to N tower, there was a kpop band doing a concert their which you got to watch for free, the views of seoul at night were amazing. If you give during the day you can enjoy the park aswell. There is loads to do at N tower. The walk back was stunning. Just be careful on some of the stairs as they are close together"
11,4.0,"Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up. I didn't go on the observation deck, but managed to get good views of the city from down below. There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower. Bus no 2 goes here from the Chungmuru area."
12,4.0,Not the first to visit  and of course be sure that you will enjoy a clear sky otherwise you will loose the reason to go all this way up to the hill.. the breathless view of seoul...
13,4.0,I have visited this place in Feb 2019. Located near Myeongdong Subway Station. We can reach there either by ropeway or by walk. Best time to visit is in the evening. There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks like Pont des arts Paris. Try to avoid this place on weekend as it will be crowded.
14,4.0,"Took the trip up to the base of the tower by the cable car, however didn’t go up this time due to the heavy haze.I have been up before and the view is good however there is a lot of reflections off the glass.The base has cafes and tourist items available however I noted the price was well above city prices.Great view even if you don’t go up the tower"
15,5.0,"This is one of the top rated things to do in Seoul and for good reason. The views from the top are absolutely unreal. That said, there is quite a hike from the bottom to the top of the tower. No cars are allowed in the area, so you take a shuttle bus costing about 1200 won per person from Myendong Bus stop 3, and a few other locations. It takes about 30 minutes to get there. From the drop off point, you have to walk up a steep hill for about 5 minutes to get to the lift to get to the top. Once there, you buy your tickets. They offer a student discount and also a senior discount for people over 65 and also a handicapped rate. Make sure you have some documentation of the disability as Japan and Korea are really tight about this and will not take your word, which is really stupid. Last week, we had to wait about 40 minutes because of the amount of people there, so we spent some time in the gift shop, capitalism amirite. Ended up getting to the top eventually and was blown away by the sheer scale of Seoul. This and Tokyo just make every other city feel like small villages, even LA and NYC."
16,4.0,"Lots available. Would be a great date spot where you could spend most of the day. Different food options, good little hike, can opt for a cable car ride, fun love lock location, a kids area, and just some nice nook and crannies to sit and enjoy."
17,5.0,"A beautiful and inexpensive way to discover the city from above! We took the cable car up to the tower as the walk can be a bit difficult and long, particularly in the cold winter so I would recommend the cable car which is cheap and very frequent. The tower gives you a time to enter the observation deck and while you wait there are little shops, food sellers and museums to look around. It's a very interactive day out, be sure to bring a marker and lock for the railings outside the tower! Buying ones there can be a bit more expensive but it's a great way to mark and remember your day"
18,4.0,"My mistake is to visit this popular attraction on a weekend evening. When I arrived on Sunday at 9:40pm and got the ticket, it showed the estimated waiting time to take the lift is 40 mins. Examine the crowd. Well, the city view on top is nice, with all the buildings and streets lights. There is a small Hello Kitty museum (separate ticket) and a sweet shop on top. The next pain is to queue and wait for the lift down. I took a public bus back to Myeongdong around and was super tired by the time I reached my hotel past midnight.There are sites such as klook and kkday which offer discounted admission tickets to the tower and Hello Kitty museum."
19,3.0,"Yes, there's a great view at the top - just like in the Empire State Building or other tall buildings in the world. But I actually found the (free) view from places like Namsan hill to be even more spectacular without the crowds, the cost and the hoopla.  Steep walk from bus area to get there if you're driving up - otherwise the lines from the cable car or the regular elevator can be long on weekends. Once I was up at the top I didn't need to stay up there very long.  If you feel you can't visit Seoul without saying you were there, or you have no other means to see something from a high view, knock yourself out and go - but if you can climb Namsan Park yourself or see a high-floor view from a hotel, skip it!"
20,4.0,"Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel.  Took me a little while to find.  Only 10,000  KRW ($8.66) to go to the top.  Cheapest tower I've ever been up.  Thursday afternoon, and although it was not empty, I certainly would not call it crowded.  Views were okay.  Difficult to find a clear day in Seoul this time of year.   I would definitely recommend it.  Lots more to do and see than just go up in the tower.  Best I can tell, it is free to go to the tower.  And there are lots of great views and restaurants and shops at the base of the tower, without paying to go up.   Several degrees cooler up there than it was down on the streets."
21,5.0,"This was great to find. First get off at Myeong-dong and take exit 1. There is a free shuttle to the tram. You can Google 'free Namsan shuttle bus' and you will get the site with time schedule. I think it is hourly. Go up the tram, or if you want walk to bar of tower. Go up tower before sunset and enjoy the view. Be sure to visit the toilets, the view is one of a kind for a restroom. After taking the tram down, I then walked to the Hoehyeon station on line 4. It was an easy walk. There is a Cafe up the tower were you can get a coffee or sweet as you watch the sunset."
22,5.0,Use google map to take bus 402 etc. Then alight at namsam library beside namsam park. Go to namsam park and go walk towards Seoul N tower.
23,3.0,"I caught the cable car because it was easier for me to get to.When you make your way out of the station at the top, you're greeted with nice views and lots of the famous love locks. The view so far is really nice and you can see quite far. I thought ""The view from the observation decks will be so much better!"" I was wrong.You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets. I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area.Essentially I paid 10,000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children, all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists.Personally, not worth the money. Catch the cable car or walk up the steps to get nice panoramic views. Don't bother with the observation decks... I'm giving it 3 points because I quite liked the views from the hill below."
24,5.0,I was using cable car to reach this place. And it's so amazing. You could see Seoul from this place. This place is so romantic 😍.
25,5.0,"South korea is truly bless by nature. You can ride or hike going to namsan tower. It was spring when i came so the scenery is superb😍 It best to travel during spring,summer,atumn"
26,4.0,"My hotel was not far away, so I walked to the cable car station, which was easy to find. I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt. I bought a one way ticket for 7,000 won. I didn’t have to wait long for my turn on the cable car, only about five minutes (around 10:45am on a Saturday). The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that. I then walked back down, since it is much easier going down stairs for me - walk back down took about 10-15 mins for me, going slow. Overall it was worth seeing and you could certainly do it for free if you are fit enough to climb all those stairs."
27,5.0,The view makes the trip up so worthwhile. The view is breathtaking. Bus trips up to the base are frequent and convenient.
28,4.0,"Waited an hour to go up to the viewing deck, that aside, the views of Seoul are fantastic.  Worth the visit, just take into consideration waiting times."
29,2.0,Sad impressions from the observation place with so dirty windows (at a sunny week). Forget abour taking professional photos here. Enter price is cheaper online (search on klook).
30,4.0,The North Seoul tower is the best way to see the city and the amazing views around Seoul.Take the gondola/ cable car up which is near Myeong-dong Metro station and you are taken to tower base within 10 minutes.The views at the base of the tower are stunning but you get the full 360 view from the top of the tower.In all a worthwhile few hours
31,5.0,"I took the challenge to hike up for about 3 kms to and from N Seoul Tower.Once you reach the top, the magnificent view of the city from afar is worth the climb."
32,4.0,I It ride on the shuttle bus (5002) in dongdaemon station and from there it was just 15mins. It was 10pm already when I’ve got here but thanks to the management they still let me in and used my voucher. I thought it was not crowded but there still a lot of tourist and locals are going here.
33,4.0,"Nice place to visit including the surrounding park, an oasis of peace in a huge city. Magnificent view over Seoul ( with clear sky ) You can go either by cable car which is not that impressive or from the other side by bus or taxi directly from metro station meyoudong which costs only about 5000 Won"
34,5.0,Fresh air and awesome view! Staying up there in the morning with sunset is just beautiful. It’s a bit cold for this time but worth it! You will have an overall view over Seoul
35,4.0,N Seoul tower and the surrounding Namsan park and gardens provide a nice break from the busy  city. Enjoy a walk through the  gardens up to the tower or take the cable car.
36,3.0,"I'm sure the views would be nice if it weren't for the smog. 360 views of the city available.  Avoid the souvenir shop.  Utter rip off. Was charged 9,500 won x 4 for four cards to send to folks back home. That's almost $40 USD!! I'm honestly horrified that they charge such prices, but promised some folks I would send a card. Never again."
37,4.0,"You can get a good view of Seoul at both the bottom and the top. That is because the tower is located on a mountain that is at one of the highest points in Seoul. Walking up the mountain is a nice way to get there, but there are also buses from Seoul Station to get to the top of the mountain."
38,4.0,Got up at 5:30an to hike from Meyongdong to the top. Amazing views along the way. Very physically draining. You will need to be pretty fit to make. Well worth it when you get to the top. Took me an hour up and 30 mins down. Which included breaks to take photos. Cable car wasn’t working when I was there but I still would have walked as it didn’t open till later. Lots of CCTV cameras so felt safe in the dark.
39,5.0,"Having visited quite a number of these towers, this is by far the best!The tower itself is not as tallest but the atmosphere within and around is unbeatable.The endless number of padlocks and viewpoints make this a special place.Once up the tower you get great views of the city! You can easily spend 2/3 hours here!"
40,5.0,Actual fact is a quite romantic tower to go especially for couples who want to lock their love up on the tower.  Is beautiful view from the top and breathtaking too.
41,3.0,"Timing is everything it seems when it comes to visiting outdoor attractions in the winter. During my visit to Seoul in February, I enjoyed some spectacular, clear and sunny days. However, on those good viewing days my schedule would not permit a visit here to the N. Seoul Tower, located within Namsan Park, here in Seoul, South Korea. Then I looked into taking a tour to the N. Seoul Tower. The price was prohibitive. However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N. Seoul Tower. My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower.So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark, gray, overcast and snowy day to see the N. Seoul Tower. I expected the taxi would take me to the top, to the base of the tower. This was not the case at all. I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit.Disappointing? Yes indeed. But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and won't have another chance to visit the N. Seoul Tower until who knows when. What is the point of this review? I strongly recommend that you DO NOT OPT TO VIEW THE N. Seoul Tower on an day with inclement weather."
42,5.0,"I tried going up to the tower by hiking. Do not start hiking later in the afternoon. It became cold and dark. So i abandoned the hike and tried again the next day. 2nd attempt was by taking the bus from Chungmuro St, exit 2. Shuttle bus no 02. Only 1,200 won. Straight up to the tower. The view was magnificent, very cold, did not buy locks to lock away my romance. Few restaurants, souvenir stores and my favourite Olive Young store. Saw few elderly people had their morning walk up to the tower. Such a Refreshing site.Must visit this place. Try using the cable which i could not find at that time."
43,5.0,"We went up to the observatory  in 30 seconds, we can viewing 360 degree city.blue house, yeoui-do, han-river and many bridge on river too.I taken many pictures at there.I was veteran, and I also got discount on admission fees.I was sorry that I could not take night tour. I would like to have a night tour at next opportunity."
44,3.0,"Dubbed as the ‘must-see’ site in Seoul and a part of all tour packages, the tower seems to be overrated. Packed with a lot of tourists, long waiting line. Btw, it does offer a great view of Seoul by night."
45,4.0,"There was a performance at the plaza area (outside, near the gift shop) where they let spectators try their hand at piercing a bamboo with a spear. Everyone laughed when the warrior (the staff haha) gasped in awe as one of the ladies managed to pierce it successfully :'D He had helped her wedge the bamboo before that. On an unrelated note, the gift shop staff was very stingy with their carrier bag. I know they don't have a culture of giving plastic bags but it's a gift shop at a tourist spot right?"
46,5.0,"This tower (also known as the Namsan Tower) is located on the second highest land point within the Greater Seoul area, located on the north side of the river. It was built in 1971, and is 236 metres high. It was built primarily as a communications tower, but with lookout facilites, restaurants, souvenir shops etc included within the design..My partner and I just happened to be staying at a hotel that was within walking distance (10 minutes), which is how we made our way to it via Sogong-Ro road (on the north side), which then proceeds into a freeway tunnel into the hill beneath the tower and its surrounds. Just before the tunnel, and on the north-eastern side, we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cable-car that takes you from the aforementioned road level, up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself. This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park... but if you're into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead. It's quite steep.There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south, and I assume that you can get a cab up, and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower.There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park, even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself. The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants, fast food outlets, souvenir shops, and lookout platforms.The views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive, and you can spend an hour or more here, depending on whether there are special events, displays, and/or entertainment on the day of your visit, before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself.But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360-degree view of Seoul. Quite spectacular. Again, shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform.And... (I can only speak for the male visitors...) DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here! Men... you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall, and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve.... and... even taking photographs from the men's toilets are encouraged.A visit to the N Seoul Tower should be a mandatory port of call if you have never visited Seoul before."
47,5.0,This is the place is really tremendous and famous in Korea. I hope we will not miss the chance of visiting such a beautiful place.
48,3.0,There are a few viewpoints for this tower. The view from the lower level and the top of the tower are roughly similiar. Don't think you need to pay extra to go all the way to the top of the tower.
49,2.0,"The N Seoul Tower is an iconic landmark located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul. Its a tower, you cen get some good views across the city, weather allowing, but sadly thats as good as it gets. The main building itself is tired and could really do with a lick of paint and some TLC. It has the usual complement of tourist gift shops, but better and cheaper items can be located in Seouls many and various shopping areas. It has a fair number of food outlets and restaurants, but again these are nothing special. There are plenty (possibly too many) places to purchase love locks and plenty of places to secure them to the building as a way of declaring you love. Positives? Well the mountain park surrounding the tower is pleasant and offers gentle walks and nice views."
50,5.0,The Seoul Tower was the one pricey site I visited in Seoul.  Most museums are free and the palaces and temples have nominal fees.  Still no visit to Seoul would be complete without a visit to the tower.  Keep in mind you need to buy a ticket up via the tram and a ticket back down. You also have the option to walk it. You’ll also need to buy a ticket to inside the tower once you reach the top.  I would recommend going up a couple of hours before sunset so you can get photos of Seoul in sunlight (hopefully) as well as at night.  There’s plenty to do at the tower so you’ll have many choices of activities to spend your time.
51,3.0,"Standing 237m atop of Namsan Mountain, N Seoul Tower, also known as Namsan Tower, is a must see when you’re visiting Seoul.Granted, although it was stunning to get a view of Seoul, I personally can think of more places that I would like to visit in this amazing city. However, don't let that deter you from visiting the tower as it is a big landmark of Seoul. It's a lovely experience to have and say that you've been there."
52,5.0,"It’s super touristic but definitly a thing to do in Seoul. The view is wonderfull.I recommend to go around sunset so you can see the view by day and night. I have the feeling that you can take better pictures from the nightview outside instead of in the tower, due to reflection from the lights in the tower."
53,5.0,"i took the cable car to namsan where the tower is located . there is a nice park there with great spots to take picture with bird view of seoul in the background. they have a space like elevator that takes you to the top and you have a 360 view of the city . i had buffett lunch in the restaurant downstairs which was very good ! i left back to the city with the cable car .must see , great view !!"
54,5.0,"I was lucky to choose a warm, sunny day in October to visit the North Seoul Tower. Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space.  Very clever...At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360° views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights. The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe. And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower. All well thought through. Oh, I forgot to say there is free, strong WiFi connectivity up here. For me, this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city."
55,5.0,If your in myeongdong then this place is a 15min walk.Once you reach the site you need to take a cable car to reach the top of the mountain.The wait for the cable car is 10mins. It takes another 5mins to reach the top.Some stunning views from the top. If you have a good camera you will be thrilled to take the best shots.
56,4.0,"A very good view from the tower. People buy locks, write their names and hang there(lovers). You can take the cable car to enjoy the Scenery."
57,5.0,"Hiked up from the main road. Steady incline so a bit challenging yet great views. Take an elevator up the tower for great view of city.  Check out the bathrooms for a unique glass floor to ceiling window!! No one around to look in:) Had typical tourist shop, but I found some beautiful cards that are pieces of art. Couples left locks all around the grounds...wished I had my husband with me. Hike back down was just as interesting as I saw different views that were equally beautiful."
58,4.0,Almost every city in the world has a landmark and Seoul is no exception. I came here last year and again this year to check it out and see the surrounding area and views again.
59,4.0,"I visited this tower at night. I saw beautiful night view, and it was incredible. When I enter the tower, ticket cost $50. However, the top floor in the tower, there was 3-D art museum. It was fantastic! Light turned on and the colors show the weather. I hope you to visit this tower!"
60,5.0,From Namsan Tower you can see whole Seoul and it's super beautiful whether its day or night! It does get a bit chilly at night so keep that in mind. :) I always try to go there when i'm staying in Seoul. There are 2 ways to get to the top : cable car and climbing up the stairs. If you are not tired and the weather is good i totally recommend climbing up the stairs because you will get to see a lot of beautiful places while going up! There are also a lot of souvenir and convenience stores in case you want to buy something.
61,3.0,"10,000 won to go up the elevator to take photos like this; hard to trust the perfectly transparent walls in the toilet assuming someone is definitely watching me doing the business. wondered what’s it like at night!"
62,4.0,"This is a nice little excursion, but quite touristy and a little tacky! It can be easily reached by metro and cable car, and price is very reasonable (around €7 round trip in a cable car). From the main area there are several viewing points all around the city, and there is a show that takes place in the afternoon (free). You pay extra to go up the tower itself - again reasonable at €7 for a 30 second lift ride to the top. There are several restaurants and gift shops at the top, and the views of the city are great."
63,5.0,When staying in Myeongdong N Seoul Tower is a must to go see. Get a cable cart ride to the top and check out the views...Anthony.D
64,4.0,This is a good place to get a good view of Seoul in all directions.  They have several places to eat and shop for the usual tourist.
65,5.0,"This was a perfect way to end my long day, after much sight-seeing around the city. The views from the obsevation deck were magnificent. I would recommend giving it a visit and if you have the extra to spend, go straight to the top."
66,4.0,"I consider this a must do in Seoul, although it does not have to cost you anything.  You can walk up to the tower from a few different spots.  It's mostly stairs, and takes 30-60 minutes.  Some really great views along the way up and at the base of the tower.  You do not have to pay to go up to the observation deck to get the great views.  You can shop, eat, and play games at the many stores in the base of the tower.  This is a great half day for anyone including those with small children.You dont really need to bring anything.  Water is good, but easily bought along the way."
67,5.0,This place deserves a 5-star-rating solely for the views of Seoul that are found at the top.  The city looks very different from the N Seoul Tower... the city almost reminds me of Rio De Janeiro the way the lighter colored buildings sprawl out over the hills. While the observatory itself is only so/so (it's crowded and the tower is somewhat old)... the surrounding area is beautiful... and I like the cable car (gondola) ride to the top (which also reminded me of Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio.Don't miss the views of Seoul from this place!
68,5.0,"Now my second time in Seoul, which is one of my new favorite cities to visit, and it came time to explore further, and the Seoul Tower was one of the locations to venture to next.  I went with a girlfriend of mine, and we enjoyed every second of it and even did the photo op opportunity with the digital background, and it came out perfect!  One of the best things I loved about being in the tower was the section of windows that had different countries/ cities and displayed how far they were and what direction they were in (a fabulous idea to have here!).  I also would recommend getting a charicature done while here as there are some amazing artists present."
69,5.0,It’s tough to go up to the entrance to the tower. The easiest way is far away from a metro so it would be a good idea to take a taxi to the library. There are other ways to walk up but they are steep and hard to climb. If you don’t think you can manage a walk up there is a cable car which can take you all the way up. Fantastic views. I went in daytime but heard that the views are fantastic in night time.
70,5.0,"Don’t be lazy to climb to the top of tower about 15 minutes . Amazing Seoul was zoomed out here - A huge of love keys that couples buy & stick them by their wishes in it :) But if someone buy key from store here , price around 5-7-8 usd per one . Worth buying or not ?. ^^"
71,5.0,"i went to Namsan tower 3 times when i was in Seoul because i loved the view so much, you dont even need to go into the tower  itself to see. its so pretty and unobstructed. if you go in the early evening you'll be able to see the city light up so so pretty"
72,5.0,"Must visit this place if you are in Seoul. This is their one of the history. It is good for a family weekends get together. It’s is nature friendly. And when I was there, there are Korean food tasting and beer tasting. There are also restaurant around the park. I would highly recommend this place to visit when you visiting Seoul.Just take bus no. 1,2,3 and 5 and pay 1200 Korean won to get there"
73,5.0,"Discover a romantic side and sight at N Seoul Tower if you're visiting Seoul. Known as the love tower, visitors and locals buy locks (which are sold as a pair in a box) and lock it around the tower. You can write the name of you and your loved ones on it -- it is said that if you do that, your relationship will stay true forever!"
74,5.0,"I went to Namsan Tower twice, both of them on the last week of June. I visited it at night time and on the afternoon the next day afterwards just so that I will be able to witness the night view and day view. The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we weren't able to see much of Seoul's skyline. However, the day view was really amazing. Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there. It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit. They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed. It's definitely one of the must visit when you're in Seoul."
75,4.0,You can take a cable ride or bus to this place. Try to skip ticketing line by purchase your ticket online. The tower offers a digital observatory with a 360° panoramic view located on the third floor of the N Tower.
76,4.0,"You can walk there from downtown and get the free funicular to the cable car - the view at the base of the tower is as good as the top of the tower and there’s actually a few things to do prior to going up the tower. I would recommend potentially not paying the 10,000 to go higher up in the tower if money is tight - but still enjoyed it!"
77,4.0,"Once I got on the correct city bus, we drove to the top of the hill where the tower was. Make sure you buy a ticket beforehand. The views from the top in the observatory are spectacular. The city and Han River are very picturesque in the evening."
78,4.0,"I didn't actually go up the tower, it was good enough to stay down and take photos from outside.  The hop on hop off bus stops here, which is nice and convenient.  You can put a lock on the fence if that's what you're here for.  There's TONS of cherry blossoms all over during the spring, which is when I came.  You will be able to get a LOT of great photos without paying to go up to the top, which is what I'd recommend."
79,2.0,"First you have to buy a ticket at the booth and you are given a number. No , you cannot just go wait in line,you have to actually wait until your number is called and it has nothing to do with the number of people in the tower, nothing. After you number is called you wait in the actual line for the elevators to go up. I takes an hour for a number to get called, then another 30-40 minutes before you are in the elevator. To go back down there is an actual line for the elevator and upon descent to get out you have to walk through an entire retail store."
80,3.0,I went in the morning and the view was OK. It wasn’t that much better than from the viewpoints below. It’s affordable and probably one of the better city views from a urinal that you will see.
81,5.0,it is one of must-visit places to complete your tour in Seoul. The 3060 views from observation deck is a great way to understand the city layout and location of those famous places in Seoul. I can see the famous lotte tower from here.
82,5.0,"On a clear and not too smoggy day, the views of Seoul were fabulous.  Even though the Tower and the area around the base of the Tower are highly commercialized, the 360-degree views were worth it.  The views from the washrooms were great too.Upon entering the Tower, you can get your photo taken then it’s photoshopped onto a background with the Tower which you can buy up at the Tower.  There are several restaurants and a coffee shop up at the Tower.  A candy store and a gift shop are also located in the observation deck of the Tower.  You can dress up in a hanbok and get your photo taken too.The area around the base of tower is covered with love locks.  There is a vending machine that sells love locks at the base.  There is an arcade and a virtual reality room at the base along with a restaurant and other food outlets."
83,4.0,"To be honest it quite crowded place, however 360° view is great. Note, due to glass window to take a good pictures is very limited.Worth visiting,"
84,5.0,Only spent a short while here as it gets so busy. If you have a good camera then night time isn’t so bad but if you don’t then day time visit is better to capture the best pictures.
85,4.0,"Ideal to go here in the afternoon while there's enough light to see the colorful love locks and walk around the area. Then wait the sunset at the top of the tower.And see the lights change from daylight to city night lights.🌇🌃 There's entrance fee so be sure to check Klook or other sites for discounts 😊.Like other tourist spots, there are shops to buy souvenirs and coffee☺️"
86,4.0,Provides a good view of Seoul. Should come late afternoon and leave at night so that you can see the day scene and the night scene.
87,3.0,"OMG THE QUEUES. 20 minutes to queue for a 8,000 KRW cable car ticket, 40 minutes to queue for the cable car itself, you pay 10,000 KRW extra per person for a ticket to the tower, 50 minutes to wait for the lift up the tower, spend 10 minutes admiring the decent views, then 20 minutes to wait for the lift back down, then 20 minutes to wait for the cable car down."
88,4.0,"Landmark of Seoul. My revisit after more than 10 years! Views are the same, but much improved facilities after all these years. Restaurants and coffee shop on the observation deck floors. Walkable from downturn area or can walk to cable car station and take cable car up. 10,000 won for adult ticket to go up to observation deck. Restaurants and coffee places at the foot of the tower"
89,3.0,It is easy to get here using public transport but it takes time so be sure to check the weather first otherwise you'll miss the view.I arrived in clear sunshine but in the next 45 minutes the cloud cover increased so I had very little time to see everything out the windows. You can see a long way when it is clear.It takes a while to come back down the tower too - not sure why but there seemed to be loads of people lining up to go back even as more arrived in the lift...N stands for Namsan in the title
90,4.0,"I wasn't aware this was on the top of a freaking mountain. Took awhile to climb up but when getting to the top, you'll notice the tower itself isn't very big. The area up there is touristy, with shops and restaurants. Maybe get the cable car going up and walk down."
91,3.0,"Nice view of the city, nice park around, few pricy restaurant..... must be seen if you go on Seoul but do not aspect something incredible"
92,5.0,Very cool place to go when coming to Seoul. Take the Tram for a few bucks or walk up the mountain. Great views of the city on a clear day. Locks everywhere . pretty neat.
93,4.0,"You can go by bus or cable car (and then walk a little bit but it's not that far). On the other hand, if you decide to use the metro, be prepared to climb some stairs! It takes a little bit of effort to get there, but I'd still recommend it!"
94,2.0,"Below the tower is a mall with some restaurants. There's also a place here to hang padlocks for couples, and there are couple benches where you can take pictures of you and your partner. Maybe kids can enjoy running around, but other than that, there's not much.As for the view from the tower itself -- it's just the view. There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.If you do decide to go up though, make sure to try the bathroom, where you can get a good view of the city from the comfort of the toilet bowl ;)"
95,4.0,"Went up the deck for viewing at night and I did not enjoy it that much. I was suppose to go there in the morning, but the one on the counter told me that the view is not good because of the fog. I did appreciate it.. I spent a few hours during the day below the deck and it was nice. Got really great photos and stuff. At night, the picture of the tower is cool too because of the light, unfortunately, it was tooooo cold so I did not enjoy it that much."
96,5.0,If you want to get here by subway you can take line 4 (blue line) and stop at the Myeongdong or Hoehyeon station and take 2 minutes walk.. then you can take the cable car the price for 2 way ticket is ₩8500/adult i recommend this  then when you reach the N tower you will find a place full of love lock..they believe when you write your name and your spouse name on it and lock it in this place your reationship will be last forever.. the price for the lock and key is between ₩8.500-₩14.500 here you can also enjoy lunch or romantic dinner in the restaurant called 'the place' or burger shop and many N tower merchandise are sold here
97,5.0,"I recommend going up for sunset (if it's sunny) Now it takes a bit to get up there, there is a little elevator that takes you up to tram, there are stairs involved in most facets of getting up to the tower if you have a problem with stairs I would look up their website and see if they have accessibility things that I didn't see (I did see one person in a wheel chair come off tram but not sure if they could go to top)   yes so anyways a good amount of stairs. A little to a long wait for tram & elevator so give yourself extra time if you want to catch sunset or something.  They light the tower up at night so catching both day and night was awesome. Highly recommend that timing."
98,4.0,"Lock key, merchandise of N tower, love icon and bench you can get all the cheesy romantic ambiance here, to to there there’s 2 way by walk on wood stairs that took less than ahour  with norma pace or by gantole, i recommend just use the cable car/gantole and later you can go down by walking, go up when evening and sunset are near its best view to see seoul by aerial view in 1st phase of photos /panaroma booth before go to the higher ground"
99,4.0,Easy to go.  Buses stop at the carpark so you can walk to the tower. But the walk way to the tower is going up the hill so that quite hard for elderly people. The tower view is beautiful you can also look aroun the tower.
100,4.0,"From the observatory of Namsan Tower, you can enjoy a magnificent view of Seoul. Around the tower is actually a park, and before and after the visit of tower, you can also spend a relaxing time. Actually I walked to the tower from Seoul station. It was a nice hiking."
101,3.0,Good place to have great views of the city. Not very expensive but Nothing special in my opinion. Went there at night so I saw the city with the lights on which was cool.
102,4.0,I walked up from city hall which was a bit of a haul. there is a gondola up which was cheap and fast which would have been a better option. overall it was quite hazy but still worth a look.
103,5.0,"Nice park around the tower, wonderful views of the Seoul. Has a restaurant on top, did not have time to try."
104,5.0,"Had a free morning, so chose to get up early and walk through the lovely park and it’s trails. A frosty morning didn’t put me off as the steady ascent soon warms you up. So peaceful for a big city! As you near the top there are remnants of the old city wall, well preserved and worth s look. Fabulous panoramic views all over the city too. Had hoped for coffee and cake but be aware that the cafes and shops do not open until 10am. The walk was well worth the effort with routes to suit all abilities. Also a public bus if you have mobility issues as well as s cable car service"
105,4.0,"We decided to walk up to the N Seoul Tower, it was a lovely walk with little stops on the way which look over the city. You can cable car up and/ or down if you do not want to walk. The tower itself is impressive but the views slightly disappointing due to the smog."
106,5.0,Good to do for about two hours because there's a lot to do downstairs from the tower and it's great to see the tower at night and in the day
107,4.0,"It was ok, but not impressive. Thanks the gondola! The walk up is not easy and you just end up wasting time. Good panoramic view of the city."
108,4.0,"I took the bus to the park at the top. Was going to pay to go up the tower, but said it was a 50 min wait, and didn't want to wait. You can walk around basically the whole base and get great views. Go inside the base of the tower for food/drinks/gift shop. I went during the Lunar New Year, so that might be why it was so busy."
109,4.0,"The tower it's far and difficult  to reach by the public  transport  and expensive to enter , there are places that you can view the city for free or much cheaper  than this tower"
110,5.0,"You can get to the tower by foot, by bus and using the cable car. The view up there is breathtaking at any time of the day, if you're in Seoul you should go there at least once."
111,5.0,I went there around 6pm. So I can saw the night view of Seoul. I usually went there by walk but this time I took a bus(takes 10-15mins to the top of mountain).The bus is stop at Chungmuro subway(metro) station(line 4). The bus number is “2” and “5” Go out Chungmuro station exit 2 and go straight about 20m.
112,3.0,"The tower is attractive, but the best part is the views from its base, which is already at a decent height (reached by cable car). From there, you get great views across the city.  Views from the top of the tower itself are almost from too great a height - it's hard to make out anything of note.  Oddly, a cleaner kept wiping the windows. Unfortunately, this didn't make them cleaner, but left great big smears which then meant everything you looked at was blurred. Overall, OK only"
113,5.0,"Be sure to go to N Seoul tower in a sunny day. Or a day that is clear. Seoul can get really foggy sometimes and this is a view that you reallywill love to see. I have been a cauple of times and i have walk all the way up, take the cable car, and in bus so you have different ways to get there. Be sure to buy the lock if you go with ypur love one is a really cute and sweet tradition. Is restaurants and the food is really good. I am not a picky eater and i love to try new foods."
114,5.0,Amazing city view of Seoul. Impressive elevator video show and loved the random game they have against the folks in Busan's tour.
115,4.0,"very nice view from above, touristy place but still a relaxing place to visit. got food options though it maybe a bit pricey. nice experience"
116,3.0,"Can't argue with the views from the top, and the complex itself has plenty of places to eat and lots of souvenir shops etc. However I'm not sure it's worth the money. Maybe if you made more of a day of it and walked round the grounds/complex you would feel it was better value. For the brave, you can hike all the way up!"
117,5.0,"I went there a least four times , with my friends , family and lover and all the occasions were good ! In winter , in summer , day or night you can go whenever you want it will always be pretty ! For me , I prefered the winter view at night, it was magical !!!"
118,5.0,Spending entire day here was really worthy! Spectacular view from the observatory tower. I got a cheap deal from Klook.com and got the chance to enter the Ssentoy Museum!
119,4.0,"Nice, but I really would stay with my visit to Lotte Tower. Is nice to go, but if you have to choose, go to Lotte Tower."
120,5.0,Something really cool about looking down on a radio tower! It was a great view despite the tower being yellow. Yellow means that the air quality is foggy usually because of smog and there not being a strong wind to move it away from the city. The tower is at peak viewing when it is lit up blue.
121,5.0,"As many times I can travel to Seoul, I'll always make it a point to travel to the tower because of the views!!Do this, you won't regret it. There's food up there, so you need not worry about eating before you go if you're in a rush."
122,4.0,"Nice way to break up a city tour, walk to the top, enjoy a churros (they were surprisingly good), buy a lock and attach it if that's your thing. Lots of photos opportunities ... can be a little crowded"
123,5.0,"Went on a very hot and humid August night, without a doubt the way to go is up the stairs. It’s a long and steep climb, but oh so worth it. Anyone can take the gondola up, take the less traveled route!"
124,5.0,"Excellent tower which is very cheap compare to other cities, good views at nighttime and the elevator area is very good for pictures."
125,5.0,"Namsan Tower is an iconic structure in Korea and its one of my places to visit in Seoul. From Myeongdong I just walked all the way to the top although you can take the cable car for KRW8500 roundtrip. I preferred to just walk to the top because there are a lot of beautiful things to see while walking, especially it was autumn. The view from the top is amazing and it gives you a great view of the city. So beautiful to see the city lights if you choose to visit at night."
126,4.0,"Although not as high as the Tokyo Skytree, the N Seoul Tower offers great views over the Korean capital. The price of the visit is reasonable, even including the cable car to get there. Walking up the stairs is also a nice option on a sunny day, but it’s a lot of stairs.The closest station for the cable car is Myeongdong, it’s a less than 15 minute walk."
127,5.0,"For those who were not able to visit on Oct, here's the place for you for Nov.  Autumn leaves and trees are extravagant for autumn. For those who missed the big exchange of guards, you can also have it here. Plus photo opportunity with the guards.Double check for the exhibit at the top if it's worth the price.Skip the deck if it's already cloudy on the ground, chances are you'll never appreciate the horizon."
128,4.0,"It is a nice place to spend the 2nd half of the day. There are restaurants, coffee shops, souvenir shops and lots of lookout points for photo taking. The sunset is amazing from the top and the night view is not too bad either. The sky toilet is an absolute must visit just for the fun of it. It is very couple-centric on the top, with various love locks locations, love-dovey photo spots targeting tourists and Seoulites going on dates."
129,4.0,"Namsan Seoul Tower (or N Seoul Tower as it is commonly called) was built in 1969. It was the first tower tourist place in Korea. It was also Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts to Seoul. The tower opened to the public in 1980.The tower has a digital observatory and a roof terrace. The digital observatory gives you a 360 degree panoramic view of the city. I noted a few restaurants - the HanCook, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul Restroom. The roof terrace is a great viewing area. It has many padlocks attached to the fence by couples to show their love for each other. These are the “Locks of Love”.The top of the tower is about 480 metres above sea level taking into consideration that Namsan Mountain on which the tower is based is 243 metres above sea level and the tower itself is about 237 metres. You take a free ride on a funicular from street level to the cable car station. At the cable car station. you need to buy a ticket here for a cable car trip to the tower complex. You can buy a single or return ticket to the tower. A return ticket costs 8,500 Won (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 – August 2017) When you get to the tower, you then need to buy a ticket for admission to the top of the tower – 10,000 Won – (equivalent to about GBP7.00 Aug 17). You can get a great view from the tower base and it is just as good as the view from the top of the tower. In the tower, the windows have the names of cities of the world and their distance from Seoul. The tower has some kiosks selling snacks."
130,4.0,"Note that a entrance fee is charged to go to the top of the tower - about 10k. The walk to the tower is rather enjoyable and is a short intense hike from the entrance of the park.The tower itself is very commercial - but what made it interesting for me is the 250 view from the top of the tower. As a European, it takes this view to grasp the extend of the large expanse that represents Seoul; dense habitations, shops, and high-rises as far as the eye can see.Taking pictures here may not be very fruitful since you’re behind glass, but you’re in the open if you go down to the 4th floor."
131,4.0,Did a walk up to the tower in the morning. Well lit up pathways. The steps are well constructed. Please carry water or fluid.Great city views.
132,5.0,"This area is simply beautiful - especially at night.  Plan to dress according to the season that you visit.  It was a bit chilly when I was there at the end of October. Beautiful city views! Very romantic (especially at night).  Be prepared to wait to go up to the top of the Tower; however, the view is worth it!"
133,4.0,"Who doen’t like cable car rides and observatories? It is a good contrast of beacon hill during the Josepn period and the technology now not to mention the romantic lovelocks, instagrammable scenic spots and the vibrant hues of autumn. Tip: use the restroom."
134,5.0,"It worth to wait in a line to attend the tower and enjoy sightseeing, great atmosphere and technoligies. An elevator will lift you to the top in 30 seconds to observe spectacular Seoul's life. All WCs are with a window wall and you may enjoy the view even there. Souvenir shop and Hello Kittie's museum provide a variety of gifts for adults and kids."
135,4.0,"Skip the bus and enjoy the hike up to the park at the base of the tower. Have a beer in the rotating restaurant, but don't eat there, and enjoy the panoramic view of the city. Go on one of the rare clear days, or you won't have much of a view."
136,5.0,"I live in Seoul for 3 years and I was lucky that my apt is located near Namsan. I always go here for a hike especially during spring and autumn season.  The view of Seoul from N Seoul Tower is quite amazing. In N Seoul, aside from the observatory there is the Teddy Bear Museum, the love lock areas and just recently they constructed a 4 or 5 storey building that houses a lot of restos, cafe, led displays and much more. My fave thing to do here is to just have a cup of coffee and just enjoy the view.It is pretty easy to go up N Seoul.  The most expensive one is thru the cable car, the most practical is thru the namsan loop buses and if ypu dont want to spend money, you can just walk.. a lot of hiking trails to choose from all with commanding views of Seoul. I highly recommend the Namsan Park wirh its  fortress wall.  If time permits, go walking or jogging in the walking path, especially during autumn as it had the best autumn leaves.There were also a lot of exercise equipments to use for free."
137,5.0,You can either climb up around 200m from the station level or get a cable car. The walk is part slope and part steps. Good exercise but not at all tough. The views as you walk up alongside the old city wall are great - but excellent from the viewing gallery up the tower. Highly recommended.
138,3.0,"I was originally going to take the cable car up to see Seoul Tower because I like cable cars.  However it is inconvenient to get the the cable car eventhough there is a free shuttle.  I read that in the afternoon the line can be quite long.  Then once you get to the top there are alot of steps to get up to the tower.  I opted to take the bus up instead.  I didn't go up to the observation deck but you can get a decent view from below as well.  LG has three OLED curved displays.  One is a wave, the other is a tunnel and the third is a circle.  There is also a 3D immersive video display as well which is kind of cool.  I waited as long as I could but I had to leave at 6pm.  Unfortunately the tower was not fully lit up yet.  They seem to light it parts of it one at a time very slowly for some reason.  I had to head back to get my bags from my hotel and head to the airport."
139,5.0,"Perhaps it was because I went during the chuseok holidays... It was mad crowded. Waited one hour to get up and another hour to get down. If you're asked to wait, head over to the N Burger. Unfortunately when I went late at night, the Burger was all sold out so I had chicken tenders instead. Pretty decent. Entrance fee is 10,000won for adult. But you can also get it on KLOOK which is about 20% cheaper.   Enter ""QL2E9"" when you check out to enjoy $4 off."
140,3.0,10 years ago it would have been a great place to visit.  Now it's nice but not breathtaking.  Nowhere near the highest in korea anymore.Can get here by walking or cable car or bus. All ok options. The queue to the top is ridiculous do don't bother.
141,5.0,"The place is lovely at night, with the lights of the tower on and getting a nice view of Seoul from the tower. There are shops and restaurants at the Tower Plaza such as Starbucks and Gong Cha."
142,3.0,"Tower is nice, it is a small size copy of the CN tower in Toronto. You can have a great view of the city but that's all. Go if you have spare time otherwise you dont miss anything."
143,5.0,Very Nice view from thé Namsan Tower in Seoul you must visit resturant när toilet souvenir shop rake the cabelcar to Tower Good ride to see the city
144,5.0,"The views from the top of the tower are absolutely spectacular. If you take the cable car up you will probably have at least an hour long line. Then when you get to the tower you will have another 30 - 45 minute long line, so take the wait into account when planning your trip. Seeing the view at night with the lights of the city is amazing."
145,4.0,"After 30+ minutes of pain, from the rather steep stairs (cable car available for lazies), the views from the top are well worth it. As in most other similar places. the top floor is quite crowded, but the floor below offers more or less similar angles and less hustle. Nice videos projected on the ceiling of the elevator during the up or down rides."
146,5.0,It is located on the hill in the center of the city and offers a great view on the city which spreads as far as one can see in all directions. If you have time get up there in the late afternoon and wait there until dark. It is worth it.
147,5.0,"I came here with a friend after a long day of walking through Myeongdong and Namdaemun market to see the tower, and it was really fun. We took the cable car up as a round trip (there is a Namsan park that you can walk through to get down the mountain, but the park is HUGE and dark at night, so be prepared for a trek if you want to do up or down that way rather than taking the cable car). The tower lights up at night (as you can see in the picture) and makes for a great photo-op. Even just being in front of the tower has some incredible views of Seoul; I can only imagine the view from the top of the tower (it costs another 10,000 Won, i.e. ~$10, to go up so my friend and I did not). There's also the famous ""lock area"" where couples write on locks and lock them to the fence all around Namsan, so if you're in a relationship and are into doing that kind of couple-y stuff, either bring a lock with you or buy one at Namsan (I don't know how much they cost, but you can buy them). There are also little cafes at the area in front of Namsan, and a pretty Korean style gazebo which makes for good pictures. There's a little arcade area too where I found some free wi-fi, so that was fun. I would recommend going at night with a friend, I think that would be the most fun. I'm definitely going to go back when I'm in Seoul again and pay to go all the way up. I want to hike through the park to get up next time, however - I actually attempted this while I was still in Seoul a few days ago, and I made the mistake of not using bug spray and wearing shorts. Guys, the park is very jungle-like, so if you don't use long pants and bug spray, you will get EATEN ALIVE by mosquitoes. Don't make the same mistake I did. I was barely walking for 30 minutes before my legs started burning with itch, and I had to sprint down the mountain before I was even halfway up. But the park is gorgeous! If you have the time, I would recommend walking your way up to the tower for sure."
148,3.0,"Unfortunately this overlook is famous as a dating spot in a country rife with couples culture. Expect lots of tourists and couples crowding this area during weekends and evenings. That said, it is a pretty dang decent view if you can peek out from over the crowds and love-lock infested railings. I would certainly recommend to hike up the mountain and arrive just before sunset. You will be tired enough to want to lounge around until the dusk, which gives you the benefit of seeing the city in the daylight, the colors of the sunset, and the lights after dark. There is a cable car you can use to get back down or you can hike it again for another workout."
149,4.0,It's a tower which gives amazing panoramic views of Seoul city!! Especially in the evening. Half way up it has its own lovelock platform. Souvenirs usually are a tad on the costlier side but the views are breathtaking. Worth a visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul!!
150,4.0,"I used to go here often when I had visitors. They charge to go up there, but if you eat at one of the restaurants, you don't have to pay for the ticket. The food is relatively expensive, around $40 per head, but the restaurant food is really good and well worth it. You can choose where to eat and what you like. Definitely worth going. It gets busy during the weekend, so better to avoid then."
151,4.0,"A nice place and well worth visiting with your loved one. There is a big focus on celebrating love.Quite a boring walk up and down, well worth getting the bus."
152,4.0,"It was easy to get there by bus (thanks to T-Mobile and mobile Google Maps). Once there, you can quickly get tickets to reach the top of the tower (I was there on a Monday morning and the place was not crowded).You can get there by a cable car (other ticket to pay) but I chose to get down by this cable car instead of getting a bus again.There are some places to eat there. The place is also very wooded as several parts of Seoul (congratulations to you, Koreans).Nice trip to see Seoul from the top!"
153,4.0,"I walked up to the cable car station from my hostel. I visited N Seoul Tower in the evening, very nice view. I enjoyed my time here."
154,5.0,"quick visit of tower  on May/2017.well organized and good facilities available , i walked all the way to top of the hill , there was a long queue at cable car station due to weekend but my plan was walking even before i arrived to station .would  like to suggest visitor to go there but not on weekends !"
155,4.0,Not a must see but this tower certainly has a great view of Seoul and is especially worth a visit close to sunset to see the many lights of the super-city Seoul come on. It can get pretty crowded up the top!
156,3.0,"I did not go there, but noted that several duty free shops were giving out its entry tickets as gifts for purchases. So for those that would shop at duty free shops, just take the chance to get the free tickets then. Enjoy!!"
157,5.0,"What a fun place to visit! Arrived before  sunset , was first in the queue to take the chairlift to the summit. Lots to explore at the top including the millions of  colourful locks on long stretches of walls and also shaped into tall cone structures. I was almost the only tourist amongst the crowds of Koreans who clearly love this destination. A number of viewing platforms give the  perfect vantage point to watch the dazzling display of city lights that turn on at dusk. Hint- taxis in Korean were very reasonable and many waiting outside so got a taxi back to my hotel taking only a few miniutes."
158,4.0,"Well, would it be very weird to say that highlight of my visit was toilet trip?)The thing is that there are cabins with panoramic view there and I bet you gonna take couple of pictures while there.Apart from that N Tower is the highest city viewing deck and I guess that in sunny weather view is awesome. On my visit day it was a bit foggy.Cable cars were closed that day so I had to get there by bus and on the way back I had to wait for ages to get back to the city. That was the only downside.The park around tower is nice as well."
159,4.0,Dont forget to ride the cable car when going up. Your camera and of course your special someone. Its where love birds can have a date hehe
160,5.0,"Incredible views of city.  If you hike up the hill, you will get a major workout!  Definitely recommend it to anyone visiting."
161,4.0,"Pulling out your camera and take the best toilet view in Seoul. The sign said you can and encourage you to ( pointing out the windows, of course)"
162,4.0,"Walked all the way up to the base of the tower through the park (a gondola is also available, but the walk was maybe 40 minutes and some good exercise).  Nice views from the top and decent elevator experience, but the Lotte World tower is much better  (Though almost triple the price, 27000 won compared to only 10000)."
163,5.0,"I made sure to bring a Hawaiian charm and a lock with me so I could place it on the fence up at N. Seoul Tower!  If you are a Korean Drama fan or on a trip with your loved one, this is a must do activity!!!"
164,4.0,"The night view is fabulous. There are several ways to go there. Cable car, buses, taxi, walk! I recomend take buses with a bit of walk to top."
165,5.0,I decided to walk up and even tho I was lost 1 hour b4 I found the right path I do not regret this site!I walked from my hotel and it was worth the walk. There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is. You can definitely walk. I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up. I rested few times. There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!!When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew. That was one of my best moments in Seoul...so lovely!I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream!I warmly recommend this experience! I walked down the mountain too....it was much easier to go down 😊
166,2.0,It is a much better idea to hike to the top and look around the area and then take a bus down again. Do not spend the money getting all the way to the top because there are other ways to see much better views here in Seoul.
167,2.0,"It was more interesting at the bottom of the tower than the top.  Some towers stand out due to architecture, some due to the elevators, some due to the educational value, some due to props inside...Unfortunately, this tower didn't stand out for any positive attributes.  It wasn't very educational or special in any way.*Health warning!*:  If you have photosensitive epilepsy, DO NOT go to this attraction!  There are no warning signs nor does anyone try warn you of anything out of norm.  I don't have this condition, but I got really dizzy in the elevator.  They turn on really loud thumping music with flashing lights of a fake night sky.  I want to say there were mirrors all around to make the elevator feel bigger and it intensified the experience.  It felt like a rave party in there and you're trapped until the elevator opens.  Due to the discomfort, the ride for me probably felt longer than it really was.  In my opinion, the special effects were totally unwarranted.  I rather they spend the money into giving some scientific information about the tower and landscape at the top."
168,4.0,"You can see the panoramic view of Seoul from N-Seoul Tower. It will be also very crowded as its one of the main attraction of Seoul. Too much couples everywhere Hahaha (am sad) loljkUnfortunately, didn't try the love lock haha Hmmm maybe next time :P"
169,5.0,"You get 360 degree views, it does get busy but worth it there are plenty of shops for eating and buying surveys, they is a cable car that takes you to almost the Base of the tower or you can catch a cab."
170,4.0,"So I visit soul city the last week in May for six days. My hotel had a direct view of the north Seoul tower or Namsan tower. I really wanted to spend one day and go visit it so I waited for a Sunday evening thinking this would be a great opportunity and a quiet time. I asked my hotel could I go to the tower by taxi and they say yes it would cost about $30 US. I got into the taxi and pointed at the picture that I had on my cell phone of the North Seoul tower and he departed the hotel. I did not know taxis and Individuals are not allowed to enter and drop you off at the north Seoul tower so he dropped me off at the cable car lift. The line for people  waiting was approximately one hour. When I got up to the top of the lift I entered and bought my ticket for the tower observation deck. There was a lot of people upstairs but it was a pretty foggy night so the view was not great. Trying to get back down again you had the lineup for approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get the elevator back down again. All in all it was a good  experience but would've been a lot better if it wasn't so foggy. I headed back to the cable car as I had bought a round trip ticket at 10:45 pm because the cable car was closing at 11 PM. The line to get into the cable car was approximately three times longer than the first time I got in coming up. I knew I would be stuck in the line for at least two hours. I ended up walking down the mountain in about 14 minutes. I still recommend this experience but I suggest two things: number one: you go there and make sure it's not a foggy day and number two:  don't use the cable car unless you don't mind waiting, just use one of the city buses that are available to go up the side of the mountain to drop you off and return you back down afterwards."
171,5.0,At this place you can spend the whole day. using the cable car is a very nice experience. Arriving at the top gives you the option to walk down or to re-sue the cable car. Every level of the tower has a lot of thing to see including kids activities. The only problem is you need to pay for every thing: $8 to use the cable car and then at each level you may need to pay similar amount to visit some place.
172,5.0,"I just returned from the tower after not having known what to expect. I'd be underselling the experience if I didn't say it exceeded my best expectations. I've really grown to love Korea and plan on visiting again in the near future. The park itself is immaculate with well maintained trails that are somewhat physically taxing but the average person will be just fine. There are also cable cars for those less inclined to get to the top on foot. Halfway up the trail you'll find a few places to grab a few items to both eat and drink. The view gets increasingly more beautiful as you climb, with the top offering a spectacular and unobstructed view of beautiful Seoul. You'll find plenty of options for both food and drink at the summit and tickets to the observation deck are moderately​ priced. There is a quaint gift shop located here as well as more options to eat and drink. All in all a great experience for solo travelers, such as myself, to couples and entire families of all ages."
173,5.0,High on a hill above Seoul with panoramic wonderful views and everyone can see it especially  at night time from street level
174,5.0,"The Seoul Tower is a terrific way to see the entire city and surrounding hills. On the way up, the elevator ceiling becomes a video as if you were blasting into outer space. To get to the tower, there are some inclines and steps - my guide knew where the elevator was to avoid the steps. After the tower, there was a live performance going on in the plaza of traditional dances and music, which was wee done. Certainly worth the visit."
175,4.0,"I've been to korea a few times. There is a few ways to get there. Either you can take a short walk from Myeongdong. Then take the oreumi elevator up to the cable car ticket counter. Or take namsam sunhwan shuttle bus no 2, 3 or 5. Both transportation way up will will show you the scenery of korea. It's beautiful all year round and each season have something different to show."
176,5.0,Great views of the city and nice place to relax with a beer. I caught the bus up (easy as) and then walked back down
177,5.0,"The N Seoul Tower area is a good place to take in the beautiful sites of the massive capital. It has the tower itself but also platforms, parks, and nature that is nice to be in too."
178,5.0,Very beautiful. On top is like being on top of the world! I only had a short time there but it is all worth it. Very lovely and romantic touring the Tower and around it.
179,4.0,"The view is good. However, before you buy a ticket, go to the so-called Heart lock observatory and check the view, particularly the degree of smog.The ticket is a bit pricey - 10 000 KRW (approximately 10 USD) for an adult.The customer service is bad - rude and almost no English.The way to the tower is clearly signed. It is sometimes steepy but doable. You need about 30 - 60 minutes depending on your fitness. Otherwise you can use a cable car."
180,5.0,"This has been one my most favourite attractions in Seoul. You can go there by cable car, bus, or you can hike up. If you want take cable car, I would suggest going around 10am since it gets really crowded afterwards. Also I would suggest to take cable car for one way that is to reach the tower. You can easily come down by the stairs while enjoying beautiful Seoul landscape. While going to the tower you can also visit Namsan park and Seoul tower complex. There's a lot of things to do there. Gaming zone, restaurants, teddy bear gallery etc. I particularly loved a perfume shop where I could make my own customized perfume. The name of this shop is A'roma Aesthetics. For me the ideal time to visit this place is in the evening although I had to wait an hour to get into cable car at this time. But I guess it's worth it."
181,3.0,"The cable car is 8,000W to the Base of the tower however it is easy and free to walk up to the Base. At the Base there are plenty of places to eat with lots of variety and a little shopping. The views from here are also good.If you want to go to the top of the tower it is 10,000W. Obviously the views are great from that height."
182,4.0,This is a good walk or you can get the cablecar. When you arrive at the top the view is incredible and a great vantage point. A must when visiting Seoul
183,4.0,"We visited N-Seoul Tower (aka Namsan tower) at noon so it was a bit hot for us though it was early April. The way led from bus stop to the tower was a bit steep but not difficult to walk. The scene around the tower was beautiful as we could see most of Seoul inner city, even the palaces. It seemed to be a ""must see"" so there was a lot of tourists and especially the couples came to hang their love locks. No need to buy the ticket to go to the observation deck (unless you'd like to do so), just go to the T1 floor and a beautiful city of Seoul is in front of your eyes."
184,4.0,Really good views of Seoul from the tower. There are also live performances in the square outside throughout the day. There is a very steep road from the car park to reach the tower so this may not be suitable for those with limited mobility/fitness
185,5.0,Went here on a Saturday night and it was an amazing view. The cable car was a bit crowded. We ended the evening with dinner at the French restaurant and it was great.
186,3.0,Can't really go to Seoul without experiencing this symbolic place. It's a bit of a madhouse going up and down because of the queues for the lifts but the view is worth it.
187,4.0,Coming from Calgary where we have the Calgary Tower this tower seems small to me however the N Seoul tower is located in a cooler spot on a mountain rather than in the downtown city. It was pouring rain today so I did not bother to go up and view as it was foggy and misty. From what I saw around its ok but not a big deal for me.
188,3.0,It is a great view from the top even if it is a bit hard to get too. Cable car was the option I chose to use. Certainly a popular spot to visit.
189,1.0,"Long lines, upsells on pictures and other items. Thereis no outdoor observation deck and the windows were filthy. Photography from the top of the tower was pointless. More long lines to get cable car back down. If you want to go take a taxi to the base and just enjoy the outdoor views from there. It will save you hours of frustration. The only positive thing I can say is that the cable car and tower ticket weren't expensive. I have no problem paying and waiting for a great experience but this wasn't even good."
190,4.0,"There's not much to say, take the cable car up, unless you enjoy long walks up steep hills....Once you pay for your ticket and head up, it's like every other tower in the world, it provides an excellent view of the surrounding city. Enjoyable way to spend an hour."
191,4.0,"If you're up for a hike, this is one of the places that you can visit. However, if you're not in shape, you can opt to ride the cable car up to the tower where you'll be rewarded with a stunning city view, cold wind and colorful light display. The place can be packed with people, so choose your time and date wisely."
192,4.0,Views from the tower are good. I visited in the late evening where it's almost dark with city lightings can be seen. I would recommend to go around 5 PM depending on the season when there is sunlight and stay until dark to enjoy both views. During spring I heard this mountain one which tower is located is full of flowers like cherry blossoms however I visited in feb and it's bone chilling cold. Also there is a locks areas once you come down from the tower quiet similar to the one in Paris. Views from this locks area is great.
193,3.0,"It can be a little tricky for a foreigner to find the cable car access, but of course you can choose to walk all the way up if youre feeling fit !  The views are good from up the top and there are food places to eat. The love locks all over the place make for good photos as well, or even placing one yourself! You can buy them from the gift shop there, so no reason to bring your own."
194,4.0,"Although I never ventured into the tower, it stands out in the city with such grace and elegance. especially at night time and a great opportunity for photographs.Standing below gives you the perspective of how tall the building it is, I would imagine on a clear day the views would be spectacular."
195,3.0,The tower is easily accessible. If you don't like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car. Otherwise there is a scenic walking path. The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower. I visited in March. Cherry blossom bloom around april. Unfortunately there was not much to see. If you are visiting in winters . Give the place a miss. View is worth it during spring.
196,5.0,"I woke up early one autumn morning and did a lot of research how to go to Namsan tower. As i was staying near Chungmuro station i just walked to Daehan Theater and waited for the bus that will take me to the tower. Asked a lot of locals where the bus was parked and to no avail, i wasn't able to get a clear answer. Took a taxi instead and a very polite ahjussi dropped me off near the gates of Namsan park and told me that taxi can't go beyond that point and i should take the bus. What a day! I couldn't get into a bus on the first place, now it's the bus again? So i've decided to take a hike and climb my way up. It was the longest 25minutes of my life. The wooden stairs seem so endless as well as the cemented one. I was literally gasping for breath when i reached the foot of tower, but worth the climb once i saw thousands of love locks in different colors and sizes, shown in dramas like Legend of the blue sea, Oh my ghostess and My love from another star. I then rode the elevator going to the observation deck and watched the city of Seoul from up there and the very colorful Namsan mountain. The maple trees were in colors red, orange and yellow. I had a hard time going up, but it was all worth it. For some of you who doesn't want to experience the long walk i did. There's a cable car station in Myeongdong that will take you right up to the foot of the tower. Don't fail to visit this beautiful site when you're in Seoul. I made sure i won't and i didn't.😊"
197,5.0,You may talk a cable car on your way up and down from Namsan Tower. I suggest going there late afternoon/early evening. Take the cable car on your way up and walk the trail on your way down to be amazed of the view that you are about to see. Really worth it!
198,5.0,"I tried different way to get here. Since I arrived very early in Seoul from Busan through a bullet train, walked from Seoul Station to the Seoul Tower... while walking, i passed by locale jogging and exercising in the cold morning. There, I had the most steps recorded in my Samsung Health App: 30,980. The wind was cold, while walking towards the destination, I saw the whole City... it was very beautiful... That trees without leaves yet... oh my God... i really love it."
199,5.0,"The Namsan mountain is very popular for its panoramic views, nature park, high-tech facilities and cultural shows.TIPS TO ENJOY YOUR VISIT1. To go up, you can either ride a cable car or, if you’re in the mood for an intense work-out, walk up the pathway.2. Go in the afternoon and stay until early evening, so you can get a view of the city both during the day and the night. The view is so beautiful.2. Check-out the schedules of traditional performances. It's spine-tingling watching the shows especially if you're into K-drama.3. Don't miss the “padlocks of love” attraction. It's a nice area to take photos.4. End the night walking to the Myeongdong area, one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism district."
200,3.0,The city view is just so so. Not really necessary to go up to the top of the tower. But good to take a walk to the tower. There's other view point you can take a photo of the city instead of going up.
201,4.0,"I went when it was raining and cold at night but there were still lot of people.There isn't much in the tower to see. Shops and dining places are kind of lame. But the Starbucks in there has windows and balcony with.a good view.After getting there on a cable car, i decided to walk down. I walked pretty briskly and it took less than half an hour to get down to the cable station on the ground level. Pretty dark when I descended in a rainy day and I was a little worried about safety  but as I walked down I saw quite a few local couples taking a walk up. The pathway gives you pretty good view of the city. And the trees along the path make the walk very refreshing. Strongly recommended!"
202,4.0,Easy access to the tower.Cable car and elevator. You can take great pictures on a clear day.Nice view and souvenir shop.
203,5.0,"The Admission: 10,000 won for the observatory entry. If you are not going up to the observatory, there is no fee to check out the surrounding area. There is cafe, shop and the famous love locket walls. The Tower: Standing at 236.7 meters tall, this is Namsan's main tourist attraction spot! You can enjoy a complete view of Seoul. Enjoy the laser show and beautiful nightscape of Seoul from the observatory on the second and third floors or in the revolving restaurant. The Location: Board Namsam Circular Bus 2, 3 or 5 or Namsam Cable Car"
204,5.0,"Check the weather for your days in Seoul. On the most beautiful day forecast, make a day for Seoul Tower. You can access it from multiple directions in Namsan Park. You can hike up single track Trails, or walk up concrete stairs and wood stairs. You can even take a trolley if you spent too much time shopping.The restaurants are average, but the views are amazing! You can see all of Seoul from 360 degrees depending on where you are standing. If you are a couple, bring a lock you think you are with THE ONE. ;)"
205,4.0,"This is the best place for a 360 degree view of Seoul. It really helps appreciate the size of this city. The available facilities are good, enabling visitors to decide the pace. If you enjoy uphill walks and have the time, then walk up the path from the park below. If you are short on time, then opt for the cable car to the tower. You will need tickets for everything, same as such towers elsewhere in the world."
206,5.0,One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.  Be sure to go up the cable car in the daytime.  At night you can take a trolley to the top.  Just wonderful.  Don't miss it!!
207,4.0,"I can't say that it's a great place, but not bad. On top you can see the whole city. But please be prepared to walk a lot and stand in a long queue. In Seoul, few people speak English and it was very strained. But overall it was exciting. I am not sure if I will come back again."
208,3.0,"You can either get up to the tower by walking or by taking a cable car. We were going to walk but couldn't find the right path so we took the cable car instead. Even though the cable car service was quite organized, there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up. The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car. I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer, when it's warm and the plants are green. I do recommend coming to the tower... but maybe not in the winter. *visited with my dad*"
209,4.0,This is a good spot to go to when you have done a lot of walking for the day & just want to slow down. It has a great 360 degree view of Seoul including it's skyscrapers & mountains. I took the Seoul City Tour Bus to N Seoul Tower which stopped just under the hill to the tower. Once there you will purchase a ticket to the observation deck which is on Level 5 & there will be a time slot allocated when you can go in.Upon existing you will see the love locks that are quite famous at this tower & take some more photos here.
210,5.0,"Nice view from the top, around a lot of shops and nice restaurants. Perfect to visit this place in the sunny day."
211,4.0,This is the highest place in Seoul whose top observatory is really proper to see around the Mega city. You can also enjoy lunch in the tower.
212,4.0,"If you would like to have a pleasant view of the metropolitan Seoul, here is the place.  The top of the mountain gives you a good view around, and on a good day, you can see as far as Incheon port, a neighboring sea port to the Yellow sea. Top of the tower gives you an observation deck and above it, a rotating restaurant.  The food or the price at the restaurant is nothing to boast about.  The whole place is usually overrun with Chinese tourists and tour buses, therefore if you choose a exercising walk up the slope, you might have to cope with the fume coming out of the buses."
213,4.0,"Just like what other reviews have mentioned, it's the best to go when the sun is going to set and slowly go towards night. The view is the best!"
214,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is a very popular place, where people put love locks all around the tower. When I visited last week it was extremely cold, so be prepared with warm clothes. There was a stand next to the fort offering free opportunity to put traditional Korean clothes and take pictures with the guards. I was luck to arrive just a few minutes before noon and I could put the hanbok on and participate in the drum ceremony. One of the guards was super nice and taught me how to play the huge drum and another person took pictures for me, it was super cool!You have nice views of the city from the tower and there are several locations with its distance in the windows. You can buy a postcard and mail from there to a loved one.The bottom of the tower has several floors underneath with a lot of restaurant and café options for food. I visited during the day, but it must have beautiful views of the city at night too."
215,5.0,I walked from the Grand Hyatt up to the Seoul Tower. Great trails and some amazing views of the city. I would recommend this for walking or jogging and just a nice place to catch some beautiful views.
216,4.0,"I got misconduct from the google maps to go here then take the wrong bus, cause me to walk up there but it worth...45 minutes walk..there also got many old peoples walk and jogging there, at there if you lucky enough you can change to the free wear korean cloth, i forgot what was the name of the attire, and you may see the guard changing place, please buy souvenirs here, because some of the items there are rare..im regretting not buying teddy bears as i teddy bear collectors, at night this place amazing,shining changing light...dont comehere as solo it make you want the other half ;)"
217,4.0,I have been to better lookout spots in the world but still this is not too bad. It is nice in the evening! Don't take the cable car (rip-off)Don't go up the tower itself it isn't worth it.
218,4.0,"Great view from top. Also there are shops that selling a padlocks (if you wanna write your couples name 😆), souvenirs, ice cream, and so on."
219,5.0,Take bus to reach there as walking could be difficult as it on namsan mountain. Visit at night time and enjoy the view
220,4.0,"With the top half all the way up to the big antenna above beautifully lit up after dark, the Tower also offers from its Observation Deck above ""360-degree views"" of the city with its illuminated skyline or just generally illuminated landscape in all directions which kind of gave me a ""surreal feeling"" (totally used to going up the towers in various countries but mostly only in daytime, so this night time view was sort of ""new"" for me); and yes, on this tower, it's not just to look out the windows but also to ""look up"" the windows where you'll see distances (assuming in those specific directions) to various major cities of the world and also to the North & South Poles; and taking up the whole space on three of the windows are a drawing of a big postage stamp with the words 'Seoul's highest post office' on it (not sure if you can actually buy those stamps on the Observation Deck), a drawing of the old city wall (with an ""actual part"" of the wall directly below if you look out that window) and a drawing that portrays the city gates (three of which that I actually got to on the ground).And yes, not just up the Tower but the base area with a spacious wooden floor is great to hang out too with a nice big gift shop right inside the Tower (a bigger shop than the one up above on the Observation Deck), a restaurant on the floor right above the gift shop, a little pavilion on one side of the wooden floor and a love-locks deck with tons of colorful love locks (which offers good city views as well) on the higher ground right beside the floor.  But for a great photo-op of the Tower (or with the Tower) itself, the best spot is a little further from that base area, specifically the love-locks deck near the top cable car station from which you'll get an ""all-inclusive"" view of the Tower not quite possible from the base area since it's too close to the Tower.Coming by subway, the station to get off is Myeong-dong (on Line 4) from which it's about a 15-minute walk south (slightly uphill) to the bottom cable car station of Namsan Mountain followed by a short 5-minute ride to the top station from which it's about a 5-minute walk to the base of the Tower; the total of 18,500 won or the equivalent of US$ 18.50 (8,500 won for the roundtrip cable car for the mountain & 10,000 won for the elevator ride to the Observation Deck on top of the Tower) is a pretty good deal really compared to ""just-for-the-deck"" prices for the towers such as Tokyo Skytree, Petronas in Kuala Lumpur & Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Skypark, and you can even save the cost of the cable car by walking up Namsan Mountain (or just do the cable car one-way for 6,000 won instead of 8,500) in which case it will be only 10,000 won to go up the Tower itself."
221,4.0,"Came by the N Seoul Tower the other day and it offered great views of Seoul for 10k entrance fee. There were plenty of add-ons available including museums, meals etc.To get to the boarding area of the tower an optional 8k won tram is an alternative to walking for 10-15 minutes in -10C winter. There's also an elevator that goes to the tram that is free although hard to locate...The top of the N Seoul Tower also has a bunch of souvenir shops promoting merchandise...Which is typical touristy stuff..."
222,4.0,"Not much to say but wow! You can get spectacular views of the city from up here. Not such a good idea to go here during weekends. I went on a Monday and there weren't a lot of people so I was able to enjoy the view.To get here, get off at Myeongdong station. I went through Exit 3 and made a 15-min hike up to the cable car station to get to the tower. Quite an exercise, but it was worth it!"
223,5.0,Great combination for this tour: Namsan CableCar (Through Orumi elevator) - Namsan Park (upper station of elevator) - N-Tower - bus to Namdaemun market.
224,2.0,"The tower is much better viewed from a distance as part of the city view.  Hordes of people visited the tower I was there; you are herded into an elevator that doesn't even have glass sides for the view.  Once you are at the top the entire area is taken with junk food and stalls selling tourist trinkets.  In three minutes you have seen everything - and then you get to stand outside for a long time waiting for the next bus down to the city! Not worth the time.The length of recommended time i have indicated includes the bus trip - the time needed to ""see"" the tour is about 5 minutes....."
225,5.0,"Went at night, beautiful view!. I got up there using the cable train and went down by bus, in my opinion is better to use the bus because is cheaper, pluss you don't really get a view from the cable train."
226,5.0,"Had a spectacular view of Seoul on top on the 360 degrees viewing gallery/platform. A family friendly, weather proof venue with many activities, cafes and restaurants within the tower building. It is also know as the ""Romantic Island"" as it is a favorite hang out place for lovers, pledging their love for each other with love locks, love tiles, love benches scribbles. A must go for love birds!"
227,5.0,I found the viisit to the tower very interesting for you can read  the distance to most of the cities in the world!!!I met  many interesting people over there!
228,3.0,the tower itself is average but it is pretty an night as it lights up.  never got a chance to get up there as the day I was going to go it was raining.
229,4.0,"The tower was great with fantastic views on the day I visited, but for me I struggled to find how to get into the tower by foot. Unbeknown to me on one side there is a cable car that takes you up there, not widely advertised, as most appeared to arrive by organised tours in coaches."
230,5.0,Love going up towers so this was a must during my stay in Seoul. Price is less than £5 to take the lift to the viewing deck. Not the easiest attraction to access as it is located on top of Namsan mountain. Two ways to get up there is by walking or taking the cable car (approx. £8 return journey).  During Oct/Nov the walk has the added attraction of autumn foliage to view.  Be bemused by the thousand upon thousands of 'love-locks that now adorn the railings - a tradition for couples to declare their love to each other - originally sparked off by a Korean TV sitcom!  On a good day you can obviously get great views of the city and its environs.
231,5.0,"I visited this tower during a Sunday while on business trip. You can take subway upto myeongdong and then walk towards the tower, which is difficult to miss. Just make sure you select the right exit when coming out of subway. The hike up the tower is not very challenging but you are advised to take cable car if extremely unfit or need special care. The on-deck visit is amazing with lovely 360 degree views of Seoul and tell you the distance for major cities in all directions. I enjoyed my visit to the N. Seoul Tower"
232,5.0,"This place is so well set up! There is restraunts, places to buy souvenirs and coffee. Many places to take photos, great view all over. Great modern atmosphere. A must see in Seoul"
233,5.0,"Start the the tour in Itaewon or the shopping area and walk to the tower in the park. The view to this big city is awesome, watch the coreans and tourists, drink a coffee and enjoy your stay"
234,5.0,I love this place.   It is extremely easy to get here by public transport. Breathtaking view of Seoul city n a sunny day.
235,3.0,"N Seoul Tower is best to go at night.I believe during off-peak tourism period, this place is still very crowded. Prepared to walk up a very steep slope. There are a couple of public bus services that go there. I believe Google can share more info on getting there.Besides the phenomenal number of love locks, the place can be quite disappointing if you have been to a couple of towers in famous cities. Compared to the Sydney Eye and Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the view of the city is that fantastic. You can buy the ticket to the Tower at a discounted price if you buy it together with a ticket to the Hello Kitty mini museum. Unless you are a great fan of Hello Kitty, the museum is very small and serves more like a couple of photo spots for visitors."
236,4.0,"This was a very quaint trip to N Seoul tower. The tower itself is located in a Park with lots of interesting monuments and views looking over the city. I would recommend to do the climb to the top rather than getting the cable car. It is well worth it just to see the views of the surrounding areas. The toweer itself is located at the top and has a small stone area in front where a martial arts demonstration was taking place when I arrived. Very nice views, would recommend if you have a few hours to spare."
237,4.0,It is best to visit at night - to look at the city night view or visit the observatory. You can visit by bus or the cable car (in Myeongdong).
238,4.0,"Came here cause when i visit a new city,  is customary to visit the tallest tower and see the view. Up a mountain, its about 40 min bus ride from Myeondong, and its ok. Its not bad view and i guess theres places to shop and eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this again"
239,2.0,"Maybe because I was there alone but I feel that N Seoul tower is a tad too touristy and the view up was great but spoilt by the cloudy weather in the autumn morning.You do have to pay to go up to the TOP of N Seoul tower (this is an addition to the cable car ride from Namsan CAble to the tower which is perched on TOP of Namsan mountain). However, if the view is already cloudy as you could have observed from the cable car ride up, you may want to skip paying to go up the tower. Instead, spend some time strolling around the area and have a nice slow walk down back to myeong dong area (a relatively short walk from namsan cable if you are fit for walking ) for lunch. It will make quite a good morning work- out. :)Oh before I forget--- do check out the toilet in N Seoul tower if you did spend the money to go up - it has amazing view from the cubicle --- I took quite a few pictures just being inside the toilet!"
240,5.0,"This is a fabulous tower accessed by either walking up a lovely park or using the cable car. Visited early in the morning, so no queues, however allow plenty of time if you want to go up at night, as it is very popular. It has a variety of food outlets and viewing areas and is a place all tourists should visit."
241,5.0,Went there for a quick trip during the day. Decided to have lunch at the Korean restaurant. It was US$25-30/person which isn't bad since entrance to the place itself is around US$15. The lunch buffet was really good so it was worth the money. We took the gondola to the top of the tower which cost around US$8/round trip. It was a nice experience. Great view of the city.
242,5.0,"Got there during bad weather, there was thick fog and it was raining. While i was drinking some tea in one of local cafes weather  improved and i decided to go up. Did some really nice timelapses with my phone during daytime and some really nice pictures of night Seoul in the evening. A must place to visit for everyone, especially photographers."
243,4.0,"My friend and I went at night time. It's easy to get there but if you want to catch the free shuttle from myeongdong station to where the cable cars are better check the time schedule of the shuttle before hand. My friend and I missed it so we took a cab and paid 3,000 won for the ride. Actually it's pretty close because my friend and I just walked back when we went home but those are your options. The waiting line can get pretty long for the cable car ride but it moves fast. It can get pretty windy and cold once you get on the tower area cause it's high up so I'd suggest bringing a jacket even if you're there during summer or spring. The night time view is really pretty! It gives you a view of Seoul and I bet it also looks great during the day as it is at night. If you are going with your lover, you  might want to try the famous love locks."
244,5.0,"I came twice in my first time to seoul,,, I'm so happy whene I came here for the second time I got free magic show that so funny..If you go there You can use bus no. 5 from myengdong st exit 3 and from chungmoro st bus. No.2And if go there by cable car, from myengdong sr exit 3 or exit 4 to cable car station.."
245,4.0,Every major city has a tower now which lights up in the night and gives a wonderful view of the city. Seoul tower is unique because it is situated on a beautiful hill and therefore is good even on day. You can take a bus or walk if you are very brave and it is very nice Must go
246,5.0,N Seoul tower is must see attraction for tourists. Adjacent to green plush Namasan park this attraction is full day activity. In night you will see colourfull view of Tower. Food snacks and drinks options available.Government as well as tourist buses operates here. No personal vehicle allowed near Namasan park in order to maintain  green park and environment.Superb and must visit location.In order to show love to your soul mate or girlfriend or boyfriend you can tie clock
247,5.0,it is not high but worth going please gogood view in night timedon't get lost or loose you childif you do loose your child contact the police imminently or check with the people around.but loosing your child is very rare
248,5.0,"K-drama fans will know this site well. Walk up the mountain and see the locks placed by lovers (which are apparently cleared out occasionally). Walk up is advanced cardio, but there are stopping points along the way. There are also bus trips that go most of the way up the mountain. Shops and eateries are at the base of the tower."
249,5.0,"I love this place, and I like to visit there again. If I have a chance I could visit there with my girlfriend."
250,4.0,"Perfect night scene overlooking Seoul city. However, if you're into taking pretty photos, I would recommend that you go in the day instead. Must-buys at Seoul tower would be the teddy bears dressed in traditional hanbok at the teddy bear museum. Good as gifts or a keepsake."
251,5.0,"Arrived early-10am and took the cable car up the mountain, walked around the observation deck.  Lots of places to take pictures, and a few stores for those souvenirs!  Wonderful walk down the mountain!"
252,4.0,"This is one of the highlights of my trip to Korea.  From the subway, had a long walk and took a cable car to the N-TOWER.  Offers great panoramic views of the city.Went to the topmost portion of the tower which they call the OBSERVATORY.  They have several decors where thosein a relationship sealed them with padlocks.At the ONSERVATORY, there are souvenir shops, some sort of museum and an Illusion show."
253,5.0,"great place, you can go to hill by transport, but I did walk & it was amazing. you can see Seoul in 360 degrees"
254,4.0,"You can view all of the city on a clear day. The day that I went it was cloudy and you could barely see past the river, but still a worth while trip. I took the train to Myeong-Dong station and walked to the tram that will take you up to the Seoul Tower and I bought a round trip ticket. On a nice day I would have done one way up and walked down. It's a fairly steep trek up. Once off the tram at the next viewing area love locks were placed everywhere, so if that something you would like to do you may want purchase it before getting there or pay 8000 won. As you proceed it does get a bit commercial and you can pay to go up to the observation deck. There are several places to eat at and I opted for HanCook which is inside the Seoul tower, but that's another review and I'm happy with that decision."
255,5.0,"Namsan Tower is the must see attraction of Seoul. I personally did not go up into the tower itself because there was a waiting period of 2 hours and it was already quite late when I got there. But the view from the deck was beautiful enough for me. The sight of the tower itself and the view of the city of Seoul really made my heart skip a beat. I understand why a lot of couples go there.There are several buses going to Namsan, I myself took bus 3 from Itaewon.Ps. It is sort of a tradition to buy a lock, write on it and hang it up on the fence on the deck. I just brought it back home with me as a souvenir lol"
256,3.0,"A visit to this tower is a must do while you are staying in Seoul. You can go by stairs, quit a walk, or by lift. There are also many restaurants at the tower but a bit too touristic for what they offer. You must go there at night. Seoul by night is nice to overview. Entrance is not expensive."
257,3.0,"The views at night were uninpressive comparing to other observation towers in the world (New York, Toronto, Chicago, London or Paris) - maybe because of the distance. Probably better to be visited during daytime."
258,3.0,"It could be one of the most beautiful places here, but unfortunately, usually there is fog or smog in the city, so the view is not so nice. And it costs some fee just to get to the tower foundation as well as to get to the top."
259,5.0,"Look up several paths throughout Namsan Park. Several food options and nice public bathrooms. Hello Kitty Museum, gift shops, touristy things to do at the top. Pictures with people dressed in Korean clothing is a fun activity."
260,3.0,Kind of disappointed when I came to this place. The shipping area is almost deserted. Only the upper deck was busy with visitors. Come here only for the view (there are other places you can go to for a better view of the city skyline and it's free) or if you want to have some romantic time with your other half and immortalize your love with a lock on the fence (gag)
261,5.0,"You should visit N Tower if you want to look at the view of seoul. It's the landmark of seoul. The entrance fee is 9000 KRW, the observatory is opened from 10:00 to 23:00 pm. You can take on the namsan circle  buses # 2 or 3 or 5 or namsan cable car."
262,4.0,"It is a great experience to visit the N Seoul Tower at night. One could see the city from the tower and there is a light show (on the tower body). It is important to do some research on the transport before going there. My first (unplanned) visit was quite troublesome. It was at night and I took a taxi from the city. The driver dropped me off and told me that was it. It was a dark road and there was not a single person around. Neither could I see any tower. Luckily I found a young couple later on and was told that I had to take a shuttle bus to go up the hill. After the trouble, it was an enjoyable experience. Please also bear in mind that most taxi drivers do not understand English and would not bother to look at your map. I ended up drawing a tower. Now, one could install Google Translate on the mobile phone to help moving around in a place like Seoul."
263,5.0,Spending time at the observation deck of the Seoul Tower is a great way to spend the evening and watch the sun set over the Seoul city skyline. I visited in October and the wind can be rather strong but it added to the wonderful experience
264,4.0,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limitedI was in Seoul for nearly 3 weeks and had only 2 days when skies could be declared relatively clear. A combination of poor weather and pollution means visibility can be poor and that would not be good for a visit to the Tower. Luckily the day I chose views were quite goodIt is possible to walk all the way from Seoul to the base of the Tower. But it's a long steep uphill trek and most people go by bus or take the cable car. Even to/from the cable car station there is a challenging flight of stairsThe attraction is popular and busy. Entrance tickets are timed to avoid overcrowding and it is possible to reserve tables at the various restaurants at the summit where expensive set price menus are offered.The observation decks are well thought out with each window containing a description of the direction you are looking. Gentlemen must check out the lavatories on the observation level - the views are great!!Visitor amenities are excellent. Outside there are pleasant grounds and further vantage points to observe the panoramic views of the city and beyond
265,5.0,I would recommend going to this place around late afternoon so you can see the sunset and enjoy the night lights Of the city. There are restaurants around the area as well. Beautiful place and it was certainly worth the trip going up the top of the tower
266,4.0,"The views from the tower are outstanding, but it's a bit pricey.  It costs about $8 to ride from the ground to the base of the tower, but another $10 to ride from the base of the tower to the observation deck.  There are restaurants both at the base and on the observation deck, and the deck has a coffee shop and souvenir shop to purchase items to remember your stop.  Otherwise, it was a great visit and easily reachable by the subway, though it is a bit of a hike up hills (on sidewalks)"
267,5.0,The N Seoul tower gives you the city view of Seoul. I saw the famous love locks which i only saw on google. It has restaurants and souvenir shops. The night view was awesome since the tower was lighted.
268,4.0,"Came here as a solo backpacker at night time. Stunning views of Seoul, even better from the top of the tower. It was extremely busy on a weekend night so I spent most of my night waiting in lines. The whole area is geared towards couples e.g. love lock walls, photo ops with love hearts, seats on an angle that make you lean into each other so I guess would make a good date spot.Would suggest not bothering with the ticket packages that include drinks and popcorn, by the time you are done with lines you will be nearly finished it. Would give it a 5/5 if i had a significant other with me lol."
269,3.0,"The feeling being up there is great as the air is clean and refreshing. The views are beautiful too. On the downside, I feel that it is overcrowded and very noisy with many tour groups and visitors. There was an event there on my day of visit which further worsen the situation. The charm of the place somehow is discounted due to this reason. Not sure for couples looking for a quiet and romantic time. Maybe along the way up as it is less travelled. Perhaps the management have to think of a way to control the influx for sustainability. Please keep it well as it is a great attraction!"
270,3.0,"First of all: don't go to the N tower if it is cloudy or the pollution dominates Seoul. During my stay I was very unlucky as I did not see the sun during 5 days, the air was something between very misty and polluted. Indeed the view from the N tower was quite disappointing. On the other way it was nice climbing up to the N Tower basement starting the walk from Namsangol Park."
271,5.0,"Take the cable car up to the base of the N Seoul Tower. You'll find a number of shops and cafés, great views and literally thousands of padlocks! Most importantly you'll find the ticket office to buy a ticket to go up in the elevator in the Tower level 5 (observation deck) where the 360 views over Seoul are very impressive. On the observation deck you can send a postcard and buy sweets and gifts. Level 7 of the tower hosts an up-market French restaurant which I did not visit myself. Take the elevator back down  and treat yourself to an ice cream, a coffee or a bite to eat. It's a great way to spend an hour or two."
272,4.0,"i went to the N Seoul Tower via bus 02 from Myeongdong Cathedral. It's cheaper than taking the cable car  that tends to be overcrowded. taking a bus takes you from the bottom of the Namsan Mountain and a little winding road going to the tower. few notable places are in the Namsan Mountain such as a school and a library i think (not sure). from the bus stop you need to hike, but hiking gives you a nice vantage point for picture taking (wink wink)."
273,5.0,"Some friends and I had a blast last weekend hiking around Namsan park to get to the N Seoul Tower. The tower is spectacular from every angle and there are lots of cool views of the tower from Namsan park. Once we reached the tower, we enjoyed some live music by the temple and had dinner & ice cream at the shops near the base of the tower. There are lots of fun and affordable souvenirs available at the gift shop there, too. We would recommend arriving at the tour around 5pm to be able to see the view of the city transition from day to night. It was really exciting to see the lights of the city come on as daylight fell. We were also lucky enough to witness a beautiful, pink late summer sunset from the top of the tower! This is an amazing place and a must-see for anyone visiting Seoul."
274,5.0,You can see this from the city since it very tallGreat view from there to over look the city with all the high building and also the old part of the city. We had a good walk from hotel to this tower. Good
275,5.0,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up  but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more."
276,5.0,"You get amazing views of the city.  Worth the tram ride up and then the elevator up the tower.  In total spent about $25 CAD round trip using the tram to the tower, up the tower and back down.  The park around the tower is nice as well."
277,5.0,I highly recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night around 9:00pm. The line wasnt bad at all but keep in mind the ticket booth for the actual tower for viewing closes at 1030pm.
278,5.0,"I didn't go up the tower but the walk itself is amazing, especially if you go before the sunset.. You can see the sunset from the hill. There are also so many couples, and so many locks everywhere, so if you have a S/O you can lock your locks. But other than that, there's a watching deck and some cafe's on top, also the walk down is nice, but if you do not like walking there is a service which takes you up. I forgot how it was called. Either way, it is worth a visit. A really nice place for a date :)"
279,5.0,We took the cable car up to the tower.  We opted for beer and popcorn with our admission and sat up in the tower to enjoy the view of Seoul.  We did it at night to see the lights.
280,5.0,For sure every visitor should get up the N Tower. The view is amazing day and night and is worth the wait and the super-touristic appeal. I recommend walking up the Namsan...
281,5.0,As in any city the high rise building or landmark towers give you an excellent view of the city and a better understanding of its size and N Seoul tower is no exception. The atmosphere around the tower base is energetic and lively specifically around the love locks and there is nice cafeterias at the base and in the tower itself with souvenirs shop too. I suggest you go in the early morning or at sunset where you can have a better view of the city and not abstracted by the high sun light specifically in summer months.
282,2.0,"The top of the hill is accessible on foot, by cable car or by bus, and the view of the city from up here is good. Be prepared to queue for the cable car.The tower provides a significantly higher view of the city but at the top it's tacky and disappointing. In particular, if you want to take good photos then it's near impossible because of the reflections in the windows. There isn't an outdoor viewing point to get around this.At the top it's a sales pitch. You can buy the green screen photo, souvenirs, postcards, drinks, memorabilia...I didn't think the tower was worth the extra cash and the issue with taking photos made it more disappointing. In hindsight, the view from the top of the hill is good enough."
283,3.0,"The tower is unimpressive, the climb up is steep and the entrance fee is rather high, but once up there it is a great view of the city!"
284,3.0,"Landmark in Seoul, you can see it in many places. Take the cable car or do a little hiking to the top of Namsan. There are shops and restaurants around the tower. Many couples like to buy a lock and tie it on the fences, meaning they are locked together, never apart. It became more popular after a recent extremely well-received Korean drama. So try it if you and your loved one fancy this little playful act!"
285,4.0,"I've been there in the evening, when the sun was already down, and the views are amazing! The only downside is that you have to wait a while (for me it was an hour) between buying the ticket and going up. But they tell you that in advance and you can wonder around during that time (there's a lot of open space with also good views of the city) or have a drink or a meal in one of the cafes there. The tower looks amazing in the evening too!"
286,3.0,"well i went  to tower , end of the the time i just look 360 view which was average , cost is high to pay"
287,3.0,Very beautiful place. The biggest in Seoul. Because of rain it was smog that day. I cannot see all the city.
288,5.0,"A one time experience. Take the cable car up and down. Long waits for cable car and sometimes to get into the city view part of the tower. Food and drink pricey up top, as you might expect. You'll be glad you went, but I doubt you'll do it again."
289,4.0,"Went in the evening to view the nightline. Basically waited in queue behind a whole village, takes almost an hour waiting in line to get on a cable car that takes 5 minutes to ascend. Had to get tickets to head up to the observatory which was another 30 minute wait. View would have been amazing if not for the fog present as it had rained beforehand. Descend was more comforting (20 minutes in line) and a lot quicker than I had thought (villagers were mostly not present)."
290,4.0,"There's 2 parts to get to the top. If you're coming from ground level, the first elevator is free of charge. Then you have a choice of paying for the next elevator, or walking up the stairs for free. On a hot or humid day or evening I would not recommend the stairs, but the option is there.The final ascent to the top of the tower does cost you an extra fee though, which is where the Teddy Bear Museum was also located. The view isn't that exciting, just lots of buildings. I think that's the only reason to go up to the top as I can't imagine the view of skyscrapers and residential towers would be that exciting from a few metres higher.So, you could do everything for free if you really wanted to, or end up spending around 10,000 to 20,000 won."
291,2.0,"I was visited this tower on night time, when i reached top floor, nothing special on this tower. Unless u come to this tower with your couple. Buy a lock and lock it. Thats all. Not really good place to visit."
292,4.0,"The day I went it was absolutely raining cats and dogs, man it was wet. So naturally I decided to walk up the hill.The path is well paved and wide, and not too steep either. The forest is lovely and the base of the tower has plenty of facilities.I ate a yummy burger and bought a delightful fridge magnet. Happy days.But I didn't bother going up the tower because it was too cloudy."
293,4.0,Worth a visit to see the park. View from tower ok if visibility is good. No need to go up tower. Namsan park walking/running track is a great place for a run.
294,4.0,"Upon arriving to the base of the tower there are a couple of reataurants, shops, a different look out points for great photos. There are plenty of walls for you to place a ""love locket"" if you so choose to. During my visit, I was able to catch a show in the center area at the top of the hill. They were exhibiting traditional Korean martial arts performance which began at 3 pm. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing or not. The view from the top of the tower gives you a perfect panoramic view of Seoul."
