1,4.0,"I arrived into Seoul for my business first trip with zero cultural knowledge (my fault).It's a gorgeous series of structures, and the grounds/gardens are a delight.  Most of the signage includes English, which made it an good educational experience as well."
2,5.0,"I visited the 4 main palaces and this one is definitely my favorite. Not the biggest or most colorful, but the architecture of the main building with all the overlaying roofs is fantastic. It is also a lot more quiet and peaceful than some of the other palaces (which are nice too)"
3,5.0,"*Fun fact: In line with steps to taint dignity of Korean people, during Japan's occupation in early 1900s, Japan turned this palace as a zoo. This place was later restored after liberation. A great place to learn about Korean history, along with great photo opportunities."
4,4.0,"Part of your combination ticket, this palace is similar to the others and easy to walk around. I do admit that after seeing a couple, they all started to run together in my mind!"
5,4.0,"If you have half a day to spare in Seoul, go and visit this palace. It's the only palace you need to see in Seoul. Great when there is no rain, you can wander the grounds, relax in the shades of the trees or watch the fish in the ponds."
6,5.0,"Take time to visit the palace.  you won't be disappointed.  If available to you, stay for the changing of the guard ceremonies. Very colorful and interesting.  Stay afterwards for fotos with the guards."
7,5.0,Fantastic history! Not sure what else to tell you. It is just one of those places you need to go to and experience yourself and try and image what the dynasty was really like!
8,5.0,Worth to be visited and to read the explanation about how Korean kings used to rule! Not that crowded as Changdeokgung Place. There is a gate to enter Changdeokgung Palace from the park of Changgueonggung Palace which is not explicitly mentioned on the maps.
