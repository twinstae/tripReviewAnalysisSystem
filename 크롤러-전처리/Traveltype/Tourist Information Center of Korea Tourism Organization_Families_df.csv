Friendly staffs and you wont regret like us. I go there also after recommended by my friend. We walked from our hostel to here. Its took about 15 - 20 mins. Lastly, dont forget to come here and have a good day!"

The gift shop was disappointing and NO K-Pop items at all. The gifts they do have are basically Station logos nothing more. Kevin was great and the lunch is amazing, the best part. It's good for filler."

You can also ""virtually tour Korea"" with virtual reality glasses. This is a great place to get brochures for tourist attractions around Korea. See pics for brochure with hours and directions."
