2,5.0,"If you have been to Lotte or Shinsegae Department stores, then Hyundai may not seem too much different, except it seems to be more classier than the others.  If you have a chance to go out to the store, take the metro, line 3, orange to Apgujeong station and come out exit 6.  First I love old department store building, made way back when everyone went down to the department store to do their shopping.  It was an experience, not like driving to malls today.  The building is beautiful, great architecture, designs and intricate details.  Inside is just as beautiful,  neat, clean, well laid out with wonderful and helpful service.  Of course plenty of food downstairs, lots of luxury items.  Worth a see if you have time."
