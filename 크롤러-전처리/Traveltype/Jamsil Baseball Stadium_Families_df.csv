0,4.0,No better way to watch a baseball game. I think I spent half my time watching the fans celebrating and cheering their team vs the actual game.  Definitely make sure if you are rooting for the home team you let the box office know so you set in that section.only drawback is not being able to get the tickets online but the truth was there was plenty of seating ( I did go on a Wed) so I was able to go to the box office and just buy the ticket an hour before.  Great selection of food inside and outside the stadium.  Anything you buy outside you can take in.  Must do in Korea
1,5.0,"So I am an official convert to baseball - Asian baseball! I loved baseball in Japan but really loved it in Korea. We went mid week which meant the crowd was small but that didn't matter. If you have access to a map, we sat in 106. Sit above that so that you get a great view of the dancers, mascot and MC. So much fun. My 8year old daughter enjoyed it too.Would do this again in a heartbeat. GO DOOSAN!"
2,5.0,We spent a fantastic afternoon at the baseball stadium with our two sons aged 11 and 9. We watched the doosan bears and more importantly enjoyed the atmosphere in the stadium. There is great food and drinks available and the crowd atmosphere is kept alive by amazing k pop style cheerleaders....this is well worth a visit and a great way to see the Korean people having fun and enjoying time away from work .
3,5.0,"I've been to hundreds of baseball games and played baseball growing up and through high school. I've never once seen a baseball game as spirited and entertaining as that, especially for a regular season game. If you haven't seen a baseball game in Korea, you have missed out. Do it as soon as you can. Lots of fun! Great for families as well."
4,5.0,"I'm not much of a baseball fan in the U.S. anymore because the games can be a bit long and a tad boring. But games here in Korea are so much fun, even if you are not rooting for either team. Both sides have drumming, and fans chant and sing for every single batter--both teams have fans that show up. Definitely go if you get a chance just for the experience.Pluses:- easy to get to via subway- food stands just outside...and you can bring the food and drinks in--kimbap, dried squid, fried chicken, ttukbokki (rice cakes cooked in kochujang [spicy red bean paste]), etc.- restaurants just outside the stadium as well- very reasonably priced tickets...ours were $12 for a great view along the first base line (top level)- super festive and fun...you will not be bored!- we were able to get tickets at the box office a couple hours before the game"
5,5.0,"Even if you are not a huge baseball fan, this is a fun time!  A must do if you are in Seoul and easy to get to on the Metro.  The box office opens at 4:30pm and the lines can be long, so I would recommend getting there early.  The game I went to sold out. The energy was just incredible.  They do love baseball in Korea."
6,4.0,"We've been to a few games and if you've never been you have to go.  Here's all the tips I know; tje subway exit for the sports complex is about 100 feet from the stadium, you can buy food and drink and bring it in to the stadium,  you can leave the stadium as many times as you like, parkingat the stadium is 4,000 won, you CANNOTpurchase tickets online no matter how hard you try UNLESS you have a Korean alien number, buying tickets at the stadium gets a little dicey on weekends, there is a HUGE difference in atmosphere from the outfield tickets to the infield tickets  (we prefer the infield tickets with our kids), the stadium can get super loud for 90% of the time (we lasted 1/2 a game the first time we went).  Tips - beers are 3,000 inside, a little cheaper outside.  Burger King and KFC is located right ououtside of the stadium.  There is a GS25 convenient store right outside the stadium for soda, ice cream cones, candy, chips, etc.  Bathrooms are huge but for some reason always seem as though they were just flooded out.  Make sure you point to the map of the seating chart when you're at the window or you'll get outfield seats for sure.  Make sure you say ""together"" when asking for the number of seats you want, if its a packed game they will assume your party will sit anywhere to get in.   Sitting higher up on the first base side will keep you out of the sun.  If the game is wrapped up by the 7-8th inning, LEAVE, and avoid the two-three hours of traffic driving a total of 10km.   Hope this helps.  Now go to the game!"
7,5.0,"Watching Korean baseball is an interesting cultural experience for an American.  The Korean fans are continually cheering for their team and are organized with a leader, drums, dancing girls and noise makers.  It is as much fun watching the fans as it is watching the game.  The fans are into the game but also courteous and friendly."
8,4.0,"Definitely worth going to a game if you get the chance. Might not be tied to a team but the cheerleaders and the crowd will have you rooting for one by the end of the 3rd inning. Not like baseball anywhere else, except maybe Japan."
9,3.0,The best place to find the baseball merchandise... when u come during tournament time.... affordable price... easy to acces...
10,5.0,"So much fun to watch a baseball game in Seoul.  Stadium was easy to get to via subway, plenty of concessions in and outside the stadium, prices were reasonable, enthusiastic fans and fun to watch cheerleaders."
11,5.0,Korean baseball is an experience all by itself...they have cheerleaders and each batter have their own theme song. I love baseball but this is something all on its own...the enthusiasm of the fans is awesome
12,4.0,the game was very exciting and the spectators wre fascinating! It was wonderful.
13,4.0,"nice stadium nicer fans but weather.I am not super baseball fan, but it was one of best experinceSee you at next trip to seoul"
14,5.0,"We attended an LG Twins game versus the Dinos tonight (15th August). Took our 2 year old and 7 month old. Had tried to attend the baseball a few times and it had been 'rained' out due to the mildest of spittle. Anyhow...Arrived at 5 an hour early to get tickets and seat. Cost 10000 won each to get tickets in blue area behind the 'cheering' seats (so about 6 quid a seat from ticket booths on day of play and these were not worst seats, they start at under 4 quid!!). On way to seats bought a load of food and drink, including can of beer from inside the stadium at a GS25 that cost 2600 won each - unbelievable value compared to sporting venues in UK. We sat down in the visiting Dinos area. Whereupon a rather colourful gentleman stood on a podium in front of the 'cheering sections' and started doing a dance with some of the most elaborate moves I have ever seen, in a peculiarly flamboyant manner. At this point I assumed someone would glass him and we would move on. However, the entire section of visiting fans (many thousands) then stood up and copied him. Old and young, rich and poor, male and female. As he span, so did they. As he thrust his hips out so too did they. They even rubbed their chests in unison with him. I have honestly never seen anything like this at a sporting venue - or indeed any other venue - in my life. This then continued throughout play. The gentleman had a break while the Dinos were fielding but came back every time the Twins were batting. In his absence four young women took his place also to be copied by the stadium. As the evening went on I watched huge quantities of alcohol being consumed. A couple of blokes in front of me nailed a pack of 24 beers between them in under three hours and then started drinking sojo. Not surprisingly perhaps the dancing became more energetic - and seemingly dangerous - as this continued. I cannot be sure if this was a one off and if this was simply a one off with the Dinos. If so I advise you to follow them anywhere in the country. What I can say is that we saw a very different side of Korean culture tonight. All the people we encountered were friendly, chatty and out to enjoy themselves (it should be noted very few near us were there to watch the baseball). This was the best thing we saw in Korea. To be honest we have not particularly enjoyed Seoul or South Korea at that. This has been overwhelmingly down to the people we have met ... we have traveled all over the world particularly in Asia and bar a few people who were incredibly kind in Korea, the vast majority of people we have encountered on this trip have been cold and even rude at times. Lots of websites speak of the South Korea as being 'rudest nation' and we even found the lovely people we met would open a conversation with an apology for their fellow country people, but still we had to experience it to believe it! Sadly it does not outweigh our other experiences in Korea, but Jamsil Stadium is certainly somewhere I would recommend starting, kind of puts rest of what you see in perspective. TIP: - Although food and beer cheap inside, so not a problem, consider taking a picnic with you (or indeed a crate of beer like the blokes we saw!) for a very cheap evening. - Definitely aim to sit in or behind the 'cheering' section (in red seats marked with a star)."
15,5.0,Soooo much fun!  Chanting and cheering between fans..so much energy!  Much cheaper than tickets in the United tates.  Can bring in your own food and drink.
16,5.0,"My sister recommended that I take my niece and nephew to watch baseball while in Seoul. Best recommendation ever! We had so much fun!The crowd was awesome. They had a song and cheer for each of the players and we joined in the fun! For $9, we had pretty good seats and it was pure fun for a good 4 hours!"
17,4.0,"I had never been to a baseball match before and I am not up on a the rules and plays but had a great time.I really enjoyed being with the home supporters and enjoyed their enthusiastic support of the Doosan Bears. The night was made even better because the Bears had a convincing win.Cost of entry is very reasonable with good seats at only 17,000 won. Facilities in the stadium are good with a fine selection of food and drink available in addition to team merchandise.Overall a good way to spend a few evening hours."
18,5.0,"Cheap tickets, buy your concessions before you head into the stadium.  Listen to the chants as almost every player has their own song for baseball.  And everything is cheap.  Imagine going to Yankee's stadium where you are drinking beer bombs for three dollars or a bottle of soju for maybe a little over a dollar.  And all these Korean snacks and fried chicken for your picking even before you enter the stadium and the concession prices inside the stadium isn't much more expensive.  If pro sports were like this everywhere else there would not be enough seats."
19,5.0,This is very different than USA Baseball and not to be missed. Imagine baseball with Korean pop cheerleaders. It is almost like you went to a baseball game and a concert broke-out!
