0,4.0,"On our last day in Seoul, we went up to Namsam Tower via Cable Car during winter. It takes 10 minutes. Luckily not many people we were able to enjoy the evening and night views of Seoul sky line. Of course the attraction were the love locks, sadly there were signs telling people the love locks will be dismantled due to safety. We bought a keychain for our daughter to write wishes on and clipped it on the railings. The keychain was much cheaper than the locks. A game room for kids and adults to enjoy was available and a few restaurants to have a cuppa hot drinks because it was freezing up there. If you are fit you can go down and take a walk along the cable car station. Lots of beautiful places to take photos behind Namsam Tower as the backdrop. A must try if you are in Seoul."
1,5.0,The ride in Namsan cable car provide a great view of Seoul when you are riding up and down.  Would suggest to take the cable car during night as the view is great.
2,1.0,"I took the cable car down with my 3 year old son (we walked up), and we looked forward to the views, but the queues are long, the staff are pretty rude, and you‚Äôre rammed in to the cars. It‚Äôs pure luck if you‚Äôre next to a window with enough room to get your camera out and take a photo. It‚Äôs definitely not worth the money (everyone over 3 pays). The walk up was really lovely - even on a warm-ish day in late May. There are also several buses that run you up to the Tower, which I‚Äôd definitely recommend over the cable car. I wish we‚Äôd walked back down."
3,5.0,"This visit to Namsan, I noticed that there were lift access for wheelchair visitors which is good knowledge if we were to bring parents next round!Autumn is one of the most beautiful periods to visit."
4,4.0,Well worth it! Nice up close view of the tower and amazing view of the city. Come just before sunset for a breath taking view. The city lights at night is also amazing. The cable car ride is usually full pack so do not expect the ride to be a scenic ride. It's just a ride to your final destination.
5,4.0,"We went to this lovely Cable Car ride coming down.It is perfect way to see the beautiful city of Seoul sky line.Only issue is ,it done so quickly and have to be lucky to have clear day.We had some cloudy day.You can do either going up or down."
6,4.0,It‚Äôs the fastest way to N seoul tower. located at the bottom of the hill. Cable car can accommodate about 50 pax per trip. Pay round trip ticket if you opt to use it going back down. Nice view to the city while on transit.
7,4.0,We took a taxi from Itaewon straight to the Cable Car station as we heard it's a very long walk uphill. It was a weekday and there was no queue. The waiting area was air-conditioned so that wasnt too bad. Strollers have to be folded while you are in the cable car. Each time a ride can fit about 20 people.
8,5.0,"I have walked up the hill to the Namsan tower before. In fact, I walked it several times before trying the cable cars.  The cable cars are the way to go!  There are still many steps to go up after getting off the cable car.  If you are not use to walking uphill on a steep incline you will want to wait for the cable car. It also offers very scenic views to the top."
9,5.0,"Great view from Namsan cable car, good ride and shortest way up to continue your walk to seoul towerüëçüèª"
10,4.0,"The old cable car which represents Namsan and Seoul.It's nothing special comparing to brand new ones in the country.But, visitors would better try when Namsan is covered with snow, cherry blossoms or fall foliages.Considering the distance, people may complain it's expensive. But, it doesn't require lots of money anyway.Trying during Chuseok or Seolnal isn't recommended because there'll be a crazy number of people."
11,5.0,"We used Cable Car when we visited N Seoul Tower. The easiest way is just walk straight from Myeongdong exit 4 and turn to the left at the intersection. Then walk about 300 meters to Namsan Oreumi. Then you can use the elevator to reach Cable Car station. To avoid the long queue on weekend, you can go on Saturday morning. From the Cable Car, you can see the view of the city."
12,4.0,"Two ways to get up there and is good to be there just before the sun set. Winter sunset about 4-5pm. You can take the cable car or taxi or drive if you rent a car. Note that the cable car fee is not the fee to the Namsan tower. Adult return ticket	8,500 won	Adult one-way ticket	6,000 won	Children return ticket	5,500 wonNamsan Tower ticket - 10,000 won for Adult. There is Hello Kitty place which you have to get a ticket too to enter. But its optional.Many eateries available at Namsan Tower. The view is Superp!. Nice place to chill. You don't have to go up the Namsan Tower if you don't want to. At the base of Namsan Tower is good enough to hang out and shoot some photos."
13,4.0,"If you are tired or can‚Äôt walk uphill, this a salvation to get to N tower, takes a while to do the line, but sometimes even it is crowded you can get it in matter of minutes"
14,4.0,"If you travel during peak session do expect to wait for 1 - 2 hours. Normal time should be within 30 minutes. Restaurant and mart available inside the station.Walking distance from Myeongdong area, about 15 - 30 minutes by foot to reach the cable station. Round trip price for adult 8500w & 5500w for children."
15,2.0,"The cable car journey is short. The cable car station is located at the mid of the hill. That is, we need to walk up the hill before you get a ride to cable car. After we arrive the hill top station, we still to walk up many stairs in order to get to N Tower. From transportation view, it is bad.The fare is expensive and not worthy.Since the journey is short, we can see the Seoul city view but the time available is very short."
16,4.0,"We stayed in Starria Hostel when we spent out holiday in Korea.Starria Hostel.located in Myeongdong which is many hotels,guest houses,hostels, restaurant,mall,etc.Myeongdong have a popular place for travellers.it called Myeongdong Market.many shops offer cosmetics,food street,fashion,etc.And in Myeongdong Area/District we can find Myeongdong Cathedral,on of UNESCO's Heritage Building in Korea.From Starria we walk to the south,along this road,until you find upstair which connected to another road.Walk 10 -20 mins you will find Namsan Cable Car.That place can bring you to the top of Namsan Tower without walking from bottom to Tower. We didnt use Cable Car..but we dont use Cable Car to Namsan Tower. We walk to the Top of Namsan Tower.From Namsan Cable Car we can walk 10 minutes to Namsan Park and continue walking to the top due to about 1 hour.The Cable Car will stop around The Tower.there are many locks which we call them Love Lock.it means that your love is locked and you must throw away the key of the lock."
17,5.0,Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour to take cable car to the mountain peak. Adult ticket is 8500 won while children below 3 years old to elementary is 5500 won.
18,4.0,"This was a nice way to avoid the endless amounts of steps on the way to the top of the tower. It's very clean and safe. Although I do not know Korean, I had no problems interacting with the ticket counter folks or other employees."
19,3.0,Visit this tower during winter. Long que start from staircase from ground floor to 4th floor (if im not mistaken) for the cable car. We have to wait about 2 hours. Nice view but its too cold with strong wind from top and im not really enjoy my trip because i had infant with me.
20,5.0,This cable car take you from the car parking lot and drop you at the Namsam tower square in less then 5 minutes. It costs Krw 8500 for one adult round trip. The city view from there very nice and you can take pictures from inside.
21,5.0,"This cablecar terminal is within 10 minutes walking distance from subway station. There's taxi provided just outside the terminal. But if you're bringing old fella or little children, it's recommended that you take a taxi or bus from subway station to the terminal."
22,3.0,"As others have said, this is used to get up the hill without walking, but not much more. It was not as packed when we arrived at around 4:00 pm, but the view from the car is secondary to the view from the top and the top of the tower. Really just saves a walk up hill, which was key with our kids."
23,1.0,"Don't waste your time or money (8500 won roundtrip!) taking the Namsan cable car up to N Seoul Tower.  Take the bus instead at a much lower cost and it also saves you time!  You will not miss anything by just taking the bus.I was initially tricked into taking the cable car.  I waited for the N Seoul Tower bus in Myeongdong.  A bus came by indicating that it would take me to the N Seoul Tower.  I asked the bus driver and he said it would go to the N Seoul Tower.  I was a bit wary as the side of the bus indicated the Namsan cable car, but the driver insisted that he would go to the N Seoul Tower.  I was a bit angry when it only took me to the Namsan Cable Car station.  This is a pure ripoff as the cable car is much more expensive than the bus up to N Seoul Tower.I made the best of it by then buying the cable car tickets.  Unfortunately, the wait was nearly 30-45 minutes, with the line snaking through the building and at times hidden from view!  It is made like a Disney theme park line so it's hard to tell the wait - and the customer service doesn't tell you the wait time!The cable car itself is quite disappointing.  It is standing room only (suffocating at times).  It was sunset when we took the cable car and unfortunately, the views are also quite disappointing as you don't get a large panoramic view as the view is actually fairly limiting.  The ride is only three minutes in length.Also beware that if you return to the cable car station after 8:30 PM, the complimentary bus stops running after 8:30 PM!  That's what happened to me and I was forced to take a taxi back to Myeongdong.  The taxi driver charged me upfront 20000 won for a short ride back to Myeongdong.  I eventually reported the driver to the Seoul government complaint website and supposedly the driver was disciplined (even though I doubt it and the driver will probably do it again).All in all, don't waste your time in dealing with these deceptive practices being run by the cable car company."
24,4.0,Came here on Sat afternoon. We followed prev reviews to go up the slope near Pacific hotel but missed the part to turn right. We walk up all the way and its a a pretty steep slope. At the end after the stairs we turn right and walked along the path next to the shops area towards namsan cable car. We came around 1-2pm and queue was 40mins long. When we came down around 4-5pm the queue was all the way till outside the building.. super long.And we realise that if u have walked along the roadside from myeondong station there is actually a lift at the bottom that will take you to the cable car station. This easier option is much recommended than the steep climb.
25,4.0,"We chose to do the cable car going up to visit the tower.  It was a short wait for a ticket, and then a longer wait to get on the car. Our trip up was at night and offered a fabulous view of the park and the city.  It was a smooth ride up.  We chose to walk down and were very glad for it as the line to go back down was very long."
26,4.0,No waiting time nice and fast. We skipped the tower so it took us around an hour for a round trip That's all I have to say 100 char limit
27,2.0,"Wait for car is long (when you get to the point it says 60minutes, add another 30). Cars are large and people are packed in like cattle. There is an elevator up the stairs for the elderly and disabled / mothers with strollers, however, in my experience my wife was allowed to go up with the stroller whisky I was left to carry the bay up the stairs ( good hour long epic). This ,ah be the best way up the mountain, but by international standards, it's a poor,y designed and organised experience. Cable car building has very dirty stairwell. Looks like it's very rarely cleaned."
28,5.0,"We were there on sunny Sunday (plus there was some kind of local festival in Namsan Park), so there was a lot of people and we had to wait to get into the car, but it was expected.Raid itself was fast and if you are next to the window (like we had the luck to be the first ones to get into the car) you will see a nice panorama of the Seoul :)"
29,5.0,Very nice place from where you can city the city of seoul . It's better to go before the sunset and stay after to see the charm of the city in day time and night time.
30,2.0,"The ride is so short and unless you get a standing window view, it's very unmemorable.  Overpriced for the short ride, too.  My second time up.  First time was 20 years ago.  This experience was a bit worse because the lines are longer now.  Take the scenic hike up or down if you can."
31,5.0,"Fastest way to reach Namsan Seoul Tower.  The Cable Car Station is easy to reach from Myeongdong but the road is quite an uphill, so you better use Namsan Orumi if you think it will be hard for you to walk on an uphill road."
32,5.0,"It's near the Myeondong Shopping Area, it's actually walking distance & accessible by bus & cab. :) 1 cable car can fit 15-20 people. :)"
33,1.0,"I've visited Namsan Tower four or five times in my nearly two years in Seoul.  Today, for the first time, I took the cable car.  Normally, I walk up the trails to the top, but this time I was with my 77 year old mother. For her sake I figured taking the cable car would be easier since it drops you off right at the base of the tower.  Bad call.I didn't realize that the walk to the cable car building was going to be long and up a steep incline from the Myeongdong subway station.   Normally I wouldn't care, but since I thought it would ease my mother's burden, I figured this was the best option for getting to the top.  Isn't the point of a cable car to save you the energy of walking up a hill/mountain? Why not start it lower down the hill and give the riders a longer ride.  Speaking of longer ride, the whole trip up is about three minutes!  6,000 won one way for only that?  Not worth it at all.  This is even coming from someone who had a good view on the cable car and only had to wait about 20 minutes in line.  I know most people have to wait an hour or more and often times have a bad view in the car.  If that was our case, I'd feel very angry and cheated.  I still feel that way, just to a lesser degree.  Overall, hike up the mountain and don't take the cable car.  With someone who isn't capable of that?  It still may be easier to get the bus to the Seoul Tower stop and walk the final half kilometer or so up the hill."
34,4.0,Easy to get tickets took four kids (between 3to 8) & two adults was fab way to get to the top of Namsam loads walks down to whichever area. Went on a bank hols and was not busy if you get there before 10am.
