0,3.0,"To reach Dream Forest, you need to transfer to blue bus from exit 3 of Dolgoji (line 6) station.  It stops right in front of Dream Forest.  Through the main east gate you will see the visitors centre with souvenir shop.  The Design gallery is located on the first floor of the visitors centre.The park has tons of things to do like flying kites, playing balls, picnics and it provides abundant amount of natural vegetation.  The Changnyeongwigung Ancestral Shrine & Bamboo Forest Path along the winding paths are great for taking pictures.  The Lawn Plaza is where concerts & events are held and there was a live band performing when we visited it."
1,5.0,"Among the large parks in Seoul (Seoul Forest, Hangang Park, Olympic Park...) Dream Forest is probably the least well known to foreigners. This is mainly due to its location in the fairly underdeveloped Northeastern part of Seoul. If you want to experience Korea as it is for many people, going to Northeastern Seoul for a few hours is a good idea : most of the city's other attractions are located in more affluent neighborhoods, and ""traditional"" or ""nostalgic"" spots (Namdaemun, Insadong) can feel a bit fake and designed for tourists. Going to Dream Forest is the perfect opportunity to walk around these smaller Streets, with smaller shops and fewer foreigners. And going to Dream Forest is the perfect opportunity to do so. The park/forest itself is nothing short of amazing. Located on a hill, it is designed kind of like a ski slope. Start at the top(near the observatory), and gently walk down the park. Each area has its own feeling, and it almost feels like a ""course"" that you can take with different areas. You have the observation tower (check it out, the view is amazing), the art all, the main building with its shops, a huge plaza, then a huge lawn, a pond with traditional Korean buildings, a flower and bamboo park... And on each side of this main course, you have the actual forest where you can go to exercise and enjoy the nature even more. Another great thing about the park is that more than any other one in Korea, it's very family friendly, so you'll see a lot of locals playing with balls, R/C car, kite, or playing badminton, while others will be picnicing or taking a nap. Definitely one of Seoul's hidden treasure."
