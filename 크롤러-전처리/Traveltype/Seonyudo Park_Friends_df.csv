0,5.0,This is a great little park that's actually reclaimed green space from a now-defunct water purification plant.  The city of Seoul has done a nice job of restoring this island to its citizens and travelers alike to come and relax and see the city from a nice angle.There are plenty of benches and viewpoints to enjoy the view of Seoul from and several short walking trails that make for pleasant strolls.  Highly recommend a visit to escape from the concrete jungle!
1,4.0,"Once the site of water treatment plants, Seonyudo Park (open 6 am until midnight year-round) is a small island on the Han River connected to the mainland by a beautiful arch bridge, with Seonyudo subway station on the brand-new line 9 located 10 minutes away.  Part of Seoul's many urban renewal projects, the industrial site has been replaced by an aquatic botanical garden with blooming water lilies, a popular playground for couples and families alike.  To learn more about the ecosystem and the ambitious Hangang Renaissance Master Plan, visit the Hangang History Museum before grabbing a quick bite at the self-serve caf√© Naru overlooking the Han."
