0,4.0,"The museum is most impressive architecturally. It is divided into three sections (each called a “museum”, and each section comprised of two or three floors).  I personally was absolutely fascinated by the ceramics collection on the top floor of museum number 1.  Much less enjoyed the exhibits in the other two museums.  My companion on the other hand, highly enjoyed all three museums."
1,5.0,"This museum was in my guide book and since it was about 3 mins away from our hotel, we decided to visit.I did not pay for the audio set but at only an extra 1,000 won it is worth getting. The museum is split into 3 parts with one part being dedicated to artifacts from various dynasties. The second museum is modern art and the third part is what I will define as ultra modern art. I liked this museum and it housed a couple of Damien Hirst paintings and a Francis Bacon painting together with 3 or 4 Anish Kapoor pieces or art.There were also a couple of unique art installations one which you enter and its mirrored everywhere. Definitely worth a visit."
2,5.0,"These amazing buildings, 2 of the 3 of which are exhibition spaces, have state of the art tech which allows a closer view of the object on one’s loaned Samsung phone as well as more information about the object. No need to input a number for the object - the phone senses when you are in front and tells you about that object until you move on. Priceless porcelains including celadon and antique objects mixed with a few contemporary art works gives context to the old. How about a dark Rothko painting next to a few hundred years old artifact?  A steel Anish Kapolei sculpture? You get the point."
3,4.0,"A friend took us to Leeum and we had no expectations. The two museums were equally beautiful. I specially enjoyed learning about modern Korean artists and the old earthenware collection. However our favorite part was the audio guide, which would automatically play files that corresponded with the artwork you were standing in front of. The museum is owned by the Samsung family, of course the technological interventions had to be there. I highly recommend this place, for it's architecture and what it holds."
4,5.0,modern building for ancien art and collections of impressive pieces (you see the difference compared to some museum) . noticeable art section with the well known korean artists.
5,5.0,"This somewhat small museum is beautifully put together.  The building itself is an art piece containing ancient and abstract pieces.  At one point, a Rothko appears in the middle of ancient pottery, but it works.  There is a spectacular infinity room and other novel modern works.  If you have a free afternoon, this is worth a visit."
6,1.0,"They are 3 places that are cool from in museum and that people take pictures of, the rest is just totally boring.The entrance fee is 10k Won. There are 2 expositions, one is about Korean art history and the other one about abstract. The first one is just so old pottery and old drawings. Not much to see, nothing really astonishing nor creative. The second one is abstract art which is an elegant word for laziness art. Many unknown foreign artists there, probably because they are too bad to be featured anywhere else.Please go to the D museum, much more alive, it's 15min away"
7,5.0,"Owned by the Samsung dynasty, it has more artefacts than of the national museum. From ancient Korea to contemporary art from this vibrant country, all in a beautiful building which is a work in art by itself. Recommended."
8,4.0,Good traditional korean art. But I prefer the part of Contemporary Art. Interesting and fun! Should go once.Remark : No photo inside
9,5.0,"Leeum is a beautiful exhibition space where modern and contemporary art meets. It is home to leading works of Korean art from as early as  1910 and onwards, along with important examples of international art since 1945. The international art collection is impressive. The extensive collection ranges from the works of such pioneers in modern Western art such as Alberto Giacometti, Francis Bacon, Mark Rothko, Joseph Beuys, and Andy Warhol to established contemporary artists, including Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, and Andreas Gursky. In addition, a growing number of works by non-Western artists within the collection reflects the dynamic and multi-centered nature of contemporary art. There is locker  facilities to store your baggage and headsets can be rented for only a ￦1000. The headset automatically detects the artworks and starts to play a very informative soundclip. I would recommend that you do this for a more educational and enriching experience. The museum has a lovely coffee café and gift shop.  Leeum's gift store is filled with inspiring gifts and a wide assortment of products reflecting the museum’s extraordinary collection and special exhibitions. Here you can find some stunning souvenirs to take home with you."
10,4.0,"if you are taking the train, the nearest station is through the Itaewon station.Then another 10-15minutes walk through the main road and up a hill to where the museum is conveniently located.  Very easy to find since there are signs and you can always ask around.The museum showcases great Korean national treasures and you can;t help but be in awe of how the government and this private company has gone through lengths of preserving such treasures.  Beautifully preserved and well-curated.There are some temporary art installations as well at the lobby and some select galleries.What excited me the most of Anish Kapoor's permanent installation ""Cloudgate"" right outside the museum yard.  Great location for a photo op!My second time to visit this museum and is always a pleasant one every time."
11,4.0,Went there with two friends and I must say it is among one of the best places I visited in Seoul. You won't regret it!
12,5.0,"Great sculptures out in the yards, interesting exhibits inside, permanent as well as rotating. Easily accessible but up a hill from Itaewon."
13,4.0,Museum visit can be a lot fun.. has so many beautiful collections and love the way it deliver the information of each item through audio sensorIt also has many attractive photo spots
14,5.0,Really solid special and permanent exhibits. Impressive. Free day pass for foreigners today (fill out a survey for free admission ~ drop off the survey on your way out) Museums here can be big and underwhelming- not the case at Leeum. Global collection/ staff is friendly/near the Grand Hyatt hotel
15,4.0,"I spent an afternoon viewing the traditional and modern art collections at this museum last fall. It was an inspiring place that I plan to return to later to see more. There are many interesting sculpture installations both inside and out of the museum. There are 2 main buildings, one for traditional/historic artworks and another for contemporary art. Lockers are available to house coats and baggage while you browse the museum. It is also handicap accessible. There is a very nice museum shop with beautiful though expensive gift options. I would recommend this museum to people aged 16 years and up. It would not be very interesting to children."
16,4.0,"Interesting world-class exhibitions in a clean and well-maintained venue. While Seoul doesn't lack for decent galleries, Leeum stands out as one of the better ones. Its location and size are also a plus as some of the better ones are located further North across the river. Highly recommend at least one visit if you are an art lover (of course check what's on first)."
17,5.0,"From architectural design to quality materials in construction, the building alone is worth a visit.  But obviously, the collection is marvelous and the way they exhibit the works is also contemporary and appropriate, appealing to the eye.  It's a bit of a taxi ride from city center.  Highly recommended."
18,5.0,"I cannot rave more about Leeum - it really is a stunning place with a wonderful curation of both modern and traditional art. As soon as I walked in there was a Kohei Nawa PixCell deer in the lobby (for any BigBang fan you'll recognise the art from the BaeBae music video)Would recommend you go with at least 2 hours in mind as their are separate areas for contemporary and traditional art both spanning multiple floors. If you like immersive art Olafur Eliasson's Gravity Stairs is one of the highlights.On the traditional side you will see lots of ancient pottery from different era's, very beautiful, calming and educational experience. On the contemporary side they had works by Warhol, Hirst and Murakami.The highlight for me were the Anish Kapoor sculptures outside (Tall Tree and Eye, and the Sky Mirror) - absolutely breathtaking and a must see for any modern art fan.Don't forget to stop by the store and pick up some art related merchandise - they have prints, printed scarves and lots of quirky items.Tip: no photos in the exhibition hall but you can take photos in the lobby and stairways."
19,5.0,"It's a little hard to find down the hill away from Itaewon, but worth the trip.  It's also worth checking their website as they rotate many exhibits.  But it's an excellent space with a nice permanent collection, and a great way to spend a few hours in Seoul."
20,5.0,"Such a great museum - the art installations outside the museum as well as the architecture are amazing -.Art work inside is great as well.Very impressed, great museum, I wish we had a similar one in Hong Kong where I live in!If you have just one museum to visit in Seoul, go to this one."
21,5.0,"So the star is the architectural solution in an area that was complicated by traffic and a rather middle to upper class private houses area. Excellent job. Samsung put a bit of cash into a collection that is very selective and has a highlight after another. You can see it was purchased in the last decade, as certain artists are there which were hyped up during that time. This is all sideshow - key is the sythesis of walking and enjoying a rather un-crowded museum.  Worth the visit"
22,5.0,this I did on my own..and I loved it. 3-4 levels of art starting at the top where they have some of their national treasures from the Joseun Dynasty and also some dating even earlier.
23,5.0,"this hidden gem is worth the effort to find.  The architecture and collections are truly world class.  Amazing installations, wonderful place to retreat from real world and spend time among some of the best art you will see, Western and Korean.  Lovely small store.  Very professional. You'll think you're in Paris!"
24,4.0,"The collections are exquisite and beautifully curated.  I'm not a great fan of the audio guides, which repeatedly tell you how beautiful everything is as if you can't see it for yourself or make your own judgement.  Worth it just for the architecture alone.  Also the best latte in Seoul, in my humble opinion."
25,3.0,"This is a good museum for viewing Korean art and ceramics in a classier setting than most.  I'm not very interested in modern art, so the modern art section was a bit lost on me.  The admission is very overpriced in my opinion."
26,5.0,"Visited the Leeum Samsun Museum of Art in April this year.  Architecture alone was worth the visit, but the distinct Modern Art and Classical Korean Art, ceramics and textiles were exquisite.  Located on a side street on Han river side of Itaewon it was a wonderful place to spend a rainy day.  Nearby is a fabulous complex called Passion 5 with one of the best restaurants and bakeries in Seoul."
27,5.0,"For art lovers, this is a jewel: beautiful collection, amazing architecture, loved the contrasts between historical Korea and modern art. Fond of the audioguides: increadible user friendly and of course made by Samsung.Thanks to the friendly staff for the tour."
28,4.0,"They often have a good variety of contemproary and modern art, as well as more traditional artistic approaches. It's good to get a wide range of award winning art pieces in one place. Special exhibitions are also particularily good."
29,5.0,"The museum is marries technology and art so seamlessly, that it was spectacular. Divided into three exhibition spaces - Museum 1 house traditional and some modern Korean art. Museum 2 exhibits modern and contemporary art from both international and local artists, while the Children's Museum exhibits more interactive modern artworks.The electronic information guide takes you through all three galleries seamlessly, with just the right amount of information and the ability to have 360 degree views of the works. The architecture and design of the building itself is pretty spectacular too - with the flow from space to space seeming to be organic. The Gravity Stairs were my favorite.There is no photography allowed in Museum 1 and 2, but it is allowed in the Interactive Gallery. You will also be required to check any bag that is bigger than a purse. There is a  coat check, as well as a lovely (but rather overpriced) coffee shop. To get to the museum by subway, take Line 6 to Hangangjin and use exit 1. Continue along Itaewon-ro to the first intersection, then turn right. Walk up the hill, past two intersections - the gallery entrance is about 5 minutes up the hill on the right and pedestrian entrance is just past the parking entrance, in line with the outdoor exhibition space. The entrance cost is 10 000 won - with an additional cost for special exhibitions."
30,5.0,"The terms ""Modern"" and ""Contemporary"" are sometimes used interchangeably, but those who are astute about the differences will know that difference in terms. So with that said, for art lovers, collectors and artists, Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is one place that should not be ignored. There are many amazing pieces by artists of historical importance like Warhol and Sugimoto, among others each of them important for different reasons at different times in the art world and actually seeing them in person is special for anyone who appreciates art.Some of the art in the collection at Leeum is exactly that: Modern. Some art pieces have both Korean and historical significance in and of itself. I will admit that art is subjective so some of the art they have just doesn't do anything for me as a graphic designer. Some of the art is strange; some of it is perplexing; some of it, I do not like; some of it, I actually love. And that's art: it's just a matter of opinion and subjective, but I think that it should be appreciated for what it is, and that is artistic. You don't always have to like everything you see; you don't always have to dislike everything that you see either; however, as a collection of modern art and as a museum, this is very good because it represents so many styles and artistic movements within the real of ""modern art.""It's a must see for art lovers and artists, so when in Seoul, plan on spending half a day there and browsing around the galleries. Check out one of the special exhibits that interests you, too. It's worth the trip."
31,5.0,There are two sections with traditional and contemporary art. Cheap hi-tech audio-guides helped us a lot but even without it eye-candy is garanteed.
32,5.0,"Beautiful art is always a joy but when it is displayed with the elegance evidence at the Leeum Sansung Museum of Art, it's a moving and edifying experience.  The joining of art and technology was done amaziingly well with easy to use well curated narratives and visuals on the Samsung devices.  One could go on ecstatically but just go there.  The building alone is worth the trip.  This has to be one of the top museums in the world.  My one suggestion would be for the narrative to explain a bit about the function of some of the pottery as well as the spot on discussion of the artistry."
33,5.0,It is its 10 year anniversary and they mixed some contemporary artwork to compliment the old. I like it but some might find it distracting. You should have a guided tour.The historical artworks are so valuable to the history of Korea. Both museums are interesting and worth the visit.
34,4.0,"It is nice to go to a place that has a combination of the modern and the ancient.  Modern art is not to everyone's taste but I liked the assortment of choices.  In the part with older art, there were some questionable choices (like a Rothko painting among the pottery because the colors matched...) but the actual artifacts were beautifully displayed.  In the Buddhist section, there were items of adornment or ""clothing"" like hats and shoes that you don't normally see. It is also not so huge that it becomes overwhelming.  You can see most of it in a couple of hours tops."
35,2.0,"This is a for fee museum. Entry is 10,000 won. So not bad but not free. They have a free bag check that they want everyone who is carrying a purse or bag larger than an evening purse to use it.They even have a measuring template. So when I transfered my passport and cell phone and wallet tissues lipstick and like that, into a small nylon shopping bag that I carry just for this eventuality, I was told it was to big to carry into the museum. I put the bag on the template and it folded up into smaller that the shape. The docent said I would have to carry the bag all bunched up. I said thank you and left the area and hung the strap on my arm. Then we started the tour using the audio guide 1,000 won, it was controlled by radar or something ,it had pictures you could pinch larger but the information was really boring and if you taped to hear more you had to stand right at the exhibit to listen. If you wondered off to another one that one came up. So no sitting and listening to extra features or looking ahead.Also no walking against the direction of the designated flow. The docent  harasses you until you comply, ' resistance is futile ' . They have an Ok collection. Not anywhere near as complete as the National Museum, which is wonderful. Everything behind plastic boxes, so why they are so worried about bags I have no idea. There were no crowds. But because you had no flexibility with the audio guide people had to stand in a bunch when there should have been room for everyone. The modern art collection is Ok. But I had to go through the bag measuring hassle again and just elected to ignore the insistence. We started our tour on a middle floor and were literally chased off and told we needed to start at the proper level. The modern art section is not in chronological order. And again no crowds. Just control freaks everywhere. Go to the Natioal Museum. It is wonderful. Avoid this thing. So not worth the money or aggravation."
36,4.0,"For one family to acquire this amount of art and Korean antiques is quite a feat and certainly worth a visit.   I would class this as a medium sized museum so if you have a short attention span before you become overwhelmed then the Leeum is perfect.  Personally I thought the architecture of the building was amazing.  It was lovely to wander round the spacious floors and enjoy the peace.  Even looking out of the windows and seeing the tall swaying bamboos was an extension of the whole experience. On a practical level, plenty of toilets on each floor, good gift shop and a coffee shop downstairs.  However, it is five minutes walk to the main street so plenty of restaurants and coffee shops to choose from there.       Definitely worth a visit."
37,4.0,"The location is not quite the easiest to find by metro/foot but the search is good you need a break from the main touristy places and shopping. The collection is well curated. There are many interesting pieces to look at both outdoors and indoors. I recommend paying a little extra for the audio guide. Go through the permanent collections before looking at the modern art section. As the museum is not massive (like, say the Lourve in Paris), setting aside just 3 hours to enjoy the trip to the Leeum is good enough. There is a little cafe on the ground floor serving just some pastries and beverages. I recommend this attraction wholeheartedly."
38,4.0,"One of the highlight when we traveled to Seoul. With a day-pass of 10000 won, you could see 2 permanent exhibitions or with the addition of 2000 won, you could see all the special exhibitions. The permanent exhibitions include classical and contemporary art. The classical collections have many treasures and national treasures with many artifacts, mainly pottery objects and Buddhism relics, not so much on paintings. While the contemporary collections have a fair amount of paintings. We spent about 3 hours there."
39,4.0,They have sculptures and painting of huge name artist. Their special exhibits are indeed special. Cool architecture. My only complaint is the pricy admission fee. The size is one fifth of Region of Honor and they still charge about the same price. Oh well.
40,5.0,"It has something for everything.  There are 2 permanent display; the historic art with porcelain ware and paintings from the early Korean periods, and the modern art museum.  The KRW 12,000 fees for a whole day pass allows you into the permanent display and the seasonal exhibits and also an audit guide that works on sensor bassi (it sense the display you are standing near and starts the guide). Great combination of using modern technology for a museum."
41,5.0,The museum is off the main road but there are signs once you get on the sidewalk.  Somehow it's not indicated on the subway's neighborhood map.  It's a nice walk to reach the museum.  You get to see three buildings designed by famous architects and the collection itself is the best of the best.  Well curated as well.  I shouldn't have gotten the audio guide.  I really didn't have time to get an explanation for each item.  Just walk leisurely and stop at an item that you like.
42,4.0,"It is an art museum. Lots of art works and ancient pieces that they show us. My friend and I thought it was about SAMSUNG's technology development museum cuz of the name. Haha. Maybe we didn't read for info that much.If you're looking for art work and Korean ancient pieces - then Yes, come here. It is very nice and the pieces are showing and organising in the modern looking way. Very nice.BUTIf you think they will show you how SAMSUNG's technology has developed, (just like we think) don't bother coming. Hahha. You can't take pics inside. But they've got free wifi. :)"
43,5.0,Very good collection.  The outdoor pieces are also great.  Its a little hard to find if you're taking the metro (or i think i should say its rather far from the metro) but hey we made it and were happy we did.
44,5.0,"I always enjoy coming here. The amount of art is not overwhelming and you get to see both old and modern art.  If you do not want to battle the crowds that can be found at the national museum and see quality foreign and Korean art, this is the place to go."
45,4.0,"Great museum, great location, good collection. The museum is split into sections: traditional, contemporary and a rotating exhibit space. The traditional collection is beautifully displayed but pales in comparison to the National Museum. The contemporary has a few celebrated artists: Koons, Rothko, Bacon but it feels a bit of a mish-mash to me. A pity that there isn't more from the expanding universe of world class Korean artists on display. Foreign tourists can find finer works by these big names in other cities."
46,5.0,"I've been here 2 or 3 times and I've never been bored. Honestly, I think that you may need at least two visits to appreciate it properly. It's really 2 museums in one. In museum one, they display traditional art. Lots of pottery, Buddhist art, paintings, etc. It's beautiful, well curated, and gives you some insight into traditional Korea. To exit museum one I descended one of the most amazing spiral staircases. It was hewn out of white marble (or some other white stone) and to get the full effect try to come on a sunny day. You won't be disappointed.Museum two, was my favorite. It was all contemporary and modern art by a varied assortment of artists. I was surprised by some of the big names they had. I had to return just to watch the full 3rd cycle of The Cremaster by Matthew Barney. Don't miss the art outside either!"
47,5.0,"Everything was excellent. From the buildings' architecture, to the selection of masterpieces. Leeum shows you treasures from Asian countries as well as modernist masterpieces.Unlike other museum, there is not this oppressing feeling when you see so many pieces and don't know where to look. It seems that everything has been carefully selected, and displayed in the best possible way.And it is owned by Samsung: their team made sure to use the best technologies and made it very educational. Perfect for childrenOne of the best museum I have been to"
48,5.0,"I love this museum.  There's a great collection of traditional Korean art, and some good contemporary pieces.  What I love best, however, is that the building itself is gorgeous, and almost like a work of art itself."
49,5.0,"This was easily my favorite museum in Seoul - and possibly in Korea (read my blog at MontrealMadame (dot) com to see those reviews). There are 3 unique buildings - each designed by a different architect - and each remarkable in it's own right. But unlike the Guggenheim in Bilboa - this one had great content as well.There were 4 'sections' when we were there - two special exhibits - and the two permanent collections. All 4 were outstanding. The Main 'Art' section is Contempory Art - and there were painting by both Korean Artists from about 1950 to 2000, and International Artistis - like Caldor, Rothko, and others. I particularly liked the Koons - a large Blue Easter Egg with a bow. The audio guide was well worth the $2 it cost - you could skip if you wanted - we didn't.The other part of the permanent collection was Buddhist art - and here the explanations were the name of the game. Just seeing and listening were interesting. But the highlight for us were the 2 special exhibits. One was titled ""Opulence: Treasures of Korean Traditional Craft"" which was basically a huge and well explained and illustrated collection of the Gold of Korea. Some pieces were over 1500 years old. Amazing to see - hard to imagine that they could still be so beautiful.The other Special Exhibit was called ""mise-en-Scene' - and it was a collection of modern Moving Image works - photographs, movies, and the like. Hard to describe - Must see though.Bottom line - go for the architecture - do the Contempory art because it's a wonderful overview of art you will be able to enjoy! Run through the pottery and Buddhist collections because to miss the top 'Treasures' of Korea would be a shame. And then hope that the Special Exhibit is as good as the ones we saw."
50,4.0,"The Leeum experience starts at the door and outside the building were pieces of art are displayed. Even the walk up to the door is a work of art (by Miyajima) with the cycle of life presented by bright aqua led numbers continuously changing.We choose to see the permanent exhibitions, Korean Traditional Art and Modern Art which is 10,000 won. Personally I thought the collection of traditional art was really impressive. It has beautiful celadon pieces even from the 14th century. By seeing the evolution in art works you understand more about the Korean history at the same time.I thought the audio was the best 2,000Won spent ever. You get a very advanced mobile phone like gadget with earpiece which pics up a signal at every art piece and tells you more about it."
51,5.0,"I've been here two times before, and each time was excellent, inside and out. Admissions are relatively low and exhibition space is larger than it seems from the outside. Overall, architecture is also pretty impressive for a space that doesn't seem that exciting from the outside. Lots sharp lines and a beautiful blending of glass, wood and concrete. The cafeteria is also pretty good, albeit just serving standard fare. Recommended!"
52,4.0,"If you have 2 hours travel time to get to the Museum, please choose another. Do you have time to come in an hour then it's worth. We found it nice house, and interesting to go round. There is just enough exposure burn diet works, etc.. We did not have much time but just over 90 minutes was amazing"
53,4.0,If you want visit one good musee in Korea.. This is the place. I am surprised to see lot of Indian God sculptures. Most of it talk about entry of Buddhism in Korea and history of Korea.. very good place to see.  The audio commentary is a must to enjoy really the culture of Korea.
54,5.0,"This is the place that you must go, if you love modern arts and the fine arts.  The 'spiders' in front of the Leeum are same as the one located outside Mori Museum in Tokyo (Roppongi), and very impressive place. They also offer audio guide that you can rent."
