0,1.0,Terrible staff attitude towards foreigners whom they donâ€™t understand because the crowd is largely korean speaking Chinese. The staff are really rude and it was really bad experience to entertain guests or clients. Secondly the dealer Shin GoKyun would accuse you of something bad because he cannot understand English and accuse you to the manager. I knew this because I could understand korean too. Such a shame and liar.
