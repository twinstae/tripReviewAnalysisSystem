0,5.0,"Amazing place we wanted to do it for fun enjoying and we asked at the entrance the forest Guard what to do. I ll add the map and the beautiful pictures of the temple there. A big harder at the end for non sportive but OK. Something to do for the view of the city from there, the rock and the temple. In Feb it was peaceful with a bit of snow there but really something to do."
1,5.0,Travelled to Bukhansan national park with my parents during winter (dec 2019). Pleasant atmosphere and serene hiking experience. Would recommend making a day trip up to enjoy the fresh air:)
2,5.0,"We are a family of four with two children (4,7). We started hiking up towards Baegundae Peak, however with the 2 kids we made it with in about 1.5k from the top. My 7 year old was fine, but my 4 year old had to be carried by daddy the further we went up. The hike was just lovely...wonderful smells, fantastic views, the nature was just gorgeous. We hiked about 4.5 hours with my kids. Stopped for lunch break (brought lunch) half way. Even if you don’t hike, I think the park is definitely something to visit to leave the hustle and bustle of the city."
3,5.0,"Hiking up Bukhansan mountain is not easy, especially the last 500 m or so, but it is definitely worth it. We did it with two children in tow (9 and 13 years old) and they were able to conquer the mountain. In total, it took us about 5 hours there and back. the view from the top is spectacular."
4,5.0,"Amazing plants, butterflies and birds. But tough trails if you are above 55. Koreans how ever - old ladies 65+ passed us like nothing and we are reaonably fit..."
5,5.0,This is a great place to hike and enjoy some stunning views of seoul. Easily reachable from any part of seoul.  Must see place in Seoul.
6,5.0,"We took 2,5 hours (ca 4 km) trekking route to the peak. Good path, nice view, but also a bit challenging. I did not have any sports shoes and it was doable! Shoes have to be comfortable and reasonable sole."
7,5.0,"3 adults.  A lovely experience near the city, particularly if you can make it to the top!  DO go to the Information Centre first where an interactive screen explains the routes - and they give you a free map.  The EASY route was the 'Easiest', but still tricky for those with frail knees :(  The rocky path got steeper and steeper.)  This was the trail from Bukhansan National Park Visitor Centre at Jeongneung-dong.  Perhaps the walking section at Sonamusup-jil is easier? but we didn't go there.  However, The blossom was beautiful and the view from the top, superb!For those who use the underground system, there is a station 'Bogungmun' which is only 4 stops away on the 110A bus.  Otherwise, get a taxi. About Won 5,000.Be prepared : good walking boots/sturdy trainers, hat & water bottle. :)  It says no pets allowed, but I don't know about service animals?  Picnic? There is a lovely, shaded  'Teahouse' at the beginning."
8,5.0,"MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT GEAR -- crampons and hiking shoes as a bare minimum! The trails up to the mountains (we went up Jaunbong and Podae Peaks and stayed around the Dobongju, Podae, and Sapae Ridgelines) are manageable, but they can get dangerous if you're like us, who only had running shoes on hand. The way up from Dobongsan Station was fine, but the far side of the mountain was covered in snow, and trying to get down without gear turned into an impromptu sledding experience. No serious injuries or anything -- it was actually kind of funny -- but we had a lot of close shaves. You'll have a great time here if you do it right rather than doing it like us. Directions we took: the 1 subway line in the Soyosan direction to Dobongsan Station (it opens up to a street with clear signage and a lot of little stores that sell hiking gear, which is super helpful!). On the way back: exited via the Hoeryong Info Center, walked for around 15 min (again, signage was pretty clear & also in English), and took the 1 line in the Incheon direction from Hoeryong Station."
9,4.0,"Good hiking shoes, sticks and gloves are highly recommended. Not suitable for children. There no proper tracks - rocky roads, stoney slippery road, and also fallen leaves making it slippery. Water and snacks are necessities.The scenery is breathtaking once you are up there, but do train up a little before attempting this ""hike"" which is more like a mountain climbing."
10,4.0,Pack accordingly and bring money. Not for people with poor health.  This is a popular place for Koreans and tourists.
11,4.0,"I'd read that this was a picturesque, popular weekend walk for locals, but was very surprised to find that climbing the summit is an all day, strenuous adventure.  My teenage daughter's & I are keen walkers, but it was unexpectedly challenging for us, so I was very glad we'd brought enough water and had the right clothing.  It is incredibly picturesque at every turn, with the side steps to temples and statues well worth it.  The summit portion was actually quite frightening with quite a crowd holding onto cables embedded in the sheer rock, hoping no one above us took a tumble.  An exciting adventure, with a magnificent view at the top, but not for children."
12,5.0,"The name of the park stands for ""big mountain in the north"". It has dozens of granite peaks and is great for hiking across the numerous valleys. Expect to spend at least half a day here."
13,5.0,Check out the view to appreciate the entire city of Seoul & look into the hills to see military bases and equipment all around
14,5.0,"Went here today and thank god there was no rain.  The hike wasn’t bad but it was very hot.  We didn’t make to the big Buddha and I was looking for that but didn’t know how far we should go.  :(  We stopped at the first temple & that was about it.  Overall, to me the hike was bad.  Make sure to bring a few bottles of water, sunblocks, & mosquitoes spray.  Wear tennis shoes or hiking shoes."
15,5.0,Amazing in autumn!! The foliage is beautiful and the air crisp and clean! Worth the little trek. And so accessible  by train.
16,5.0,We hired a private tour guide to be able to drive us to Mt Bukhan and Bukhansan National park- this was really one of the highlights of our trip—we walked a shorter trail up to Harujae ridge that just took ~1.5 hours round trip—nice stone steps looked natural but made it easy to climb- great views. Teenage girls enjoyed it as just a short enough hike. Pretty steep so coming down would be difficult for people with knee problems. Very nice morning outing for the drive and hike and able to get back to Seoul city center in the early afternoon.
17,5.0,Amazing Place. I only visit in winter with a lot of snow and love it. The possibility of being so near of the city center and have a place like this is incredible. It's nice to go all day. In weekends it's full of locals all dress up to go to the mountain. If you want to go to the top be aware that if you don't have good boots with good grips it can be danger (in winter).
18,5.0,The National Park is a very good place to experience nature in the massive city.It's important to know that Koreans are hiking very often. That means you should definitely choose one of the easier tracks if you aren't hiking often (like every weekend).The view of the city is awesome. You can see the mountains on the other side of the city if the smog isn't too bad.
19,4.0,"I would say this hike starts of pretty comfortable but perpare yourself because it may take you at least 2 hours to get up. As you hike higher up this mountain it becomes a bit more strenuous. At a certain point right below the summit you have to climb up the ""never-ending"" steep stairs, then use a rope that is provided to help pull yourself up. There were many people on this hike it was well trafficked. The view is breath taking.BRING lots of water and snacks to eat along the way."
20,5.0,"This is a national park very easy to get to from Seoul. Lots of hiking trails. Locals all fully kitted out, tourists usually not. Good views of the city. Some very challenging hikes to the summits, but easier ones too. We went to Guknyeongsa temple with the huge Golden seated Buddha. A much shorter walk, well sign posted but with some slippery paths, so good shoes useful Go to the main park entrance, Bus 34, 704 or 8772 from Gupabal station on line 3, or just follow the crowd of hikers and get off when they do. A nice break from the city, and pretty views."
21,5.0,"Not the easiest hike, but definitely worth it! Baegundae peak has an amazing view, and we enjoyed a mini picnic before descending. So do bring some food with you, you will need the energy. Spot the mountain kitty! There are many many trails, so do enjoy taking different routes for the scenery & nature."
22,5.0,This is my favorite place to unwind and decompress.  I love Bukhansan!We have gone here with our family several times and the views are incredible and the trails are well maintained and easy to follow.
23,5.0,"I lived in one of the neighbourhoods below the park, it was a park I frequented for both short and long hikes. It has so many to choose from and all of them are well used and peaceful with something wonderful to enjoy no matter which way you choose. All paths are well marked."
24,5.0,We took the private tour and the employees were amazing. The hike is not for the faint of heart but it was well worth climbing. The views are great. The sauna experience will shock you as to how detailed and exotic it is but you will love it. The lunch was absolutely delicious and filling. Our tour guide moon made it so much fun for us. Strongly recommend.
25,5.0,Best part of our Seoul vacation was family hike of Bukhansan National Park to reach Baegundae Peak. The views from the top are breathtaking and not to be missed. You need to have the proper hiking gear to go up as the trail is long and challenging. Took our family almost 4 hours to reach the peak.
26,5.0,The view up there is nice and refreshing. its not the hardest place to get to but you still need to do a bit of research. i went there really early in the morning so there was hardly anyone and at times i am quite worried that i will get lost but all in all. its a must do if you like nature and hiking :)
27,5.0,"We started the hike early in the morning and had the Baegundae peak to ourselves! Starting from the east side, it is quite challenging  (there is an easier route from the west side of the park). It's a short drive from the city - 15 min by taxi. Highly recommended time away from the busy city."
28,5.0,"Been there during Spring time, cooler than i thought. I suggest you bring a jacket along when hiking and bring more water and fruits. And I really recommend you to bring your lunch and snack and have a nice rest on the top of the mountain and enjoy the nice view!!! It was really nice but strong recommend wear long trousers and bring a coat ahhaa"
29,5.0,"Bukhansan is amazingly beautiful.  We did a 3 hr. hike and there were cherry blossoms all around.  Take a picnic and buy a korean flag beforehand like we did for great photos on top.  To get there:  Take subway to Gupadal station, exit 1.  From there take bus #704, 34, or 8774 (you will see other hikers) towards Bukhansanseog Fortress (about 10 stops).  We just got off with the other hikers, no problem.  There are restaurants at the bottom too."
30,5.0,"This was an unexpectedly difficult but fun hike. You should be in reasonable shape or you might not enjoy this. Don't trust the Korean national park website that claims this is a beginners hike with slight slopes. When we arrived, we saw the sign - intermediate/advanced and even expert at the top. We decided to just go for it anyway and try to hike up as far as we could. And eventually ended up on the top. Our kids were actually not the problem, they kept jumping ahead over the stairs and boulders, but we got a little tired instead - it is a lot of stairs going up through the forests but you are frequently rewarded with great peeks of the surrounding rocks and summits. The last (optional) part of the hike is pulling yourself up along huge steel wires leading to the summit, but every post is secured by 3 wires, so I personally found it very safe for kids. No danger of slipping off somewhere.We started around 12 when a lot of older local folks were already heading down and when we arrived at the top 3 hours later, it wasn't crowded. It was on a weekday though, a Wednesday which is probably the best time to go up, the weekends are supposed to be very crowded. It was a bit chilly up there. We ate our snacks with great views over Seoul and accompanied by 5 cats (who knows how they got up there).We headed down the other way on the back of the mountain which had fewer stairs and a shorter way down. There was also a small hut where you could buy snacks and refreshments. We heard from hikers there were buses leaving from exit of the park but we were picked up by a very friendly Korean CSI guy (haha) who also took us to the nearby Buddhist temple around the corner and drove us to the next metro station. I was a little suspicious at first but he turned out to just be a super nice family father.Take the Metro Line 3 to Daehwa and get off in Inchuk. Wait for bus 72 that takes off at the exit and tell the driver (Bukhansan). When you are dropped off, continue to walk past a kiosk with barking dogs and then take a right. Walk up the street past the big signpost saying Bukhansan National Park. Keep walking up the road past all the hiking equipment stores on your left until you come to the little hut where the paths start off. Definitely grab a pair of gloves on the way if you plan to make it to the top, it will prevent you from getting sore palms. English maps are out of stock at the moment, but everything is signposted well enough that you neither require a guide nor a map. Oh, when you see the signpost to the left to Baegundae peak, don't cross the river but continue to walk up the river on the right river bank. The rest is well posted. You cannot get lost. Have fun! Bring lots of snacks and water."
31,5.0,Climbed Mt Baegundae the tallest mountain in the park  in the afternoon in the snow on the day i arrived in Seoul.  The trails were good and well marked but the steep slopes on the last 1km were tough in snowstorm and icy conditions. Ice Cleats (spikes) are needed for the climb - which can be purchased at one of the many outdoor shops near the park entrance.  The mountains looked beautiful in the snow.
32,5.0,"We hiked the summit of Mt. Baegundae: Very recommendable challenge! Cables and stairs help, ice and snow did not, but we made it :-)"
33,4.0,"Be aware this is a tough walk, have some good mountain shoes (beter then sneakers), a walking stick can really help, and bring enough water. When we reached one of the tops, it was cloudy so the view on Seoul was not very good. The taxi's to go back were difficult. The trick is to have your hotel name and the adress in Korean on your smartphone. We even had to swithc from taxi to get back to the city centre."
34,5.0,This is a great experience if in Seoul..although it will also test your fitness. Its best hiked weekdays at 7am ~ 9am start and aim to return by lunchtime.
35,5.0,"We hiked it with our daughters aged 9 and almost 11. And the trails were a lot harder than we expected them to be. We all wore sneakers and that's a minimum. I asked at the information counter and was advised on the route to walk. We ended up walking 11k with almost 700 meters in elevation (Hike from Bukhansanseong Information Center to Daenammun Gate via Daeseongmun gate to Jeongeung Information Center.) Apparently easier and shorter routes are available but I didn't find them. We did it a nice and dry October day, I can imagine when it's hot, colder or wet the hikes to be quite tough and you would need better gear to cope with the circumstances.But it's an excellent day trip when visiting Seoul and definitely worthwhile the trip out.It's easy to get to the park. Several metro station feed into bus lines that will take you to the start of the trails (just follow the other hikers). Bus also announces and displays in english what the stops are called so it's fool proof."
36,5.0,"We visited the Bukhansan National Park as part of a tour to get up to the Bukhansan monument. The views at the top are incredible. It's a robust hike but the view at the summit makes it well worth it. In short, well worth doing. It was one of of the main highlights of my trip!"
37,5.0,Easy access from all parts of Seoul City that takes an hour+ max. via Seoul Metro. Excellent place for Hiking & Climbing which is a suburban area of the Seoul City.
38,5.0,We had a beautiful hike here one of the hottest day this summer. The view was breathtaking and the paths was great!
39,5.0,"I visit Seoul and unexpected find this exciting climbing activity. I was a bit worry about the arrangement on the activity, as i don't expect to have this outdoor activity in Seoul, but my worry is gone when i reach there and saw my private guide. I meet him on TravoAsia.com which offer many  special and unique activities in Seoul. The climb took a day, so prepare yourself for a day of workout. but the experience was really good and they all speck english. We meet some other travellers as well and end up eating dinner in a traditional restaurant nearby. It was very helpful when you join an activities with local. I strongly recommend that apps. Go check it out. Have a good trip"
40,5.0,"This mountain has various hiking trails. Our family of 5, including children aged 10, 8, and 4, hiked 3.2 km to Daedongmoon and back down. It took us about three hours. It was very enjoyable but not so easy for the young one. We hiked without hiking shoes and my wife ended breaking her converse walking shoes. For your best experience, hiking shoes are strongly recommended. There were a couple of running wells along the way. They were refreshing and safe to drink as well."
41,5.0,"Absolute worth the hike to the peak. Some planning required though, if you decide to go for public transport, there are apt descriptions on how to get there on google. Be prepared to change public transport at least two or three times if you are going there by public transport. If you're going by taxi, please remember to write down a phone number, or install a taxi app, to ensure you'll get a taxi when you're done. As getting a local taxi near the National park is very difficult.In terms of trip length etc, there are multiple paths and trips. Would recommend to go to the peak, but to take some detours to see local attractions (such as building and temples on the way). It is possible to take a different path up and down to the peak. We were told that getting up and down the peak would take 5 hours. We talked with some locals afterwards, which informed us that it was not unusual to spend as much as 9 hours getting up and down, with a lot of rests.If you are going to the top, pack stuff in a backpack, and not a shoulder bag. Also, bring some food and snacks, and minimum 1 - 1,5L of water per person (possibly more if its a really sunny day).In terms of other equipment, hiking shoes is not required, some good sneakers will do. If you have sensitive hands, you might want to bring some gloves for the parts where you have to pull yourself up alongside the wire fence. Bringing children below 10 years to the peak, is possible, if they have previous experience with walking and hiking in mountains. We had a couple of 8-year olds with us. But they had quite some experience from before.Also, make sure someone brings a map, and reads it. It will save you some hassle following and reading signs. There are however, signs everywhere, both in English and Korean."
42,5.0,"Head away from the city for just a day, and spend it hiking with the locals! (Weekends are best for spotting the locals in all their hiking gear, having picnics.)There are a lot of different routes to take, and none of them are particularly tough, so just try one of them. Once you get higher up, you will see the old wall and lots of guard towers/gates.We went on a Saturday, and it was one of the best experiences I have had. We went all the way up to some peak and the view of Seoul was incredible (you can really see how big it is). The best thing was probably on the way down when some of the Koreans started speaking to us and we ended up having a swim and some food/drink with them in/next to a creek."
43,5.0,"Great park to visit  with local hikers of all ages moving at a quick pace.Easily accessible by taking the subway to Dobongsang station.Bring good hiking shoes,light garment  and enough water supplies since you will most likely sweat it out on the climb !The hikes are mostly moderate to intense and none require special skills or climbing experience but couch potatoes may consider excessive.."
44,5.0,"If you enjoy hiking, this is a great experience.  My 12 year old son, two of his friends, my 14 year old daughter climbed, and I climbed to the Baekundae peak in early April 2016.  It was a challenging climb but worth it at the top.  You should go prepared, water, some protein, and ready for a nice climb.  Be aware, the is a lot of hiking/climbing on rocks.  While there are some hand rails and stairs in specific spots - it is not a maintained walking trail (like you find hiking to the Seoul tower).  We went up on one side and down the other.  Total time with about 30 minutes at the top was about 5 1/2 hours hiking.  Children under 10 will find it difficult.  You can take the subway, then bus - very easy."
45,4.0,"This park is well maintained and worth a visit. Two tips: be wary of crowds on the weekends, and get a map or local friend to avoid becoming lost. Bukhansan has a variety of trails available, most of which are worthwhile. Koreans love hiking, and traffic can be bumper-to-bumper on weekends, so I recommend going on a weekday."
46,5.0,"satisfy with the view, I use cable car to go up, not many people. I think bcos of weekdays. overall, really enjoy the trip!"
47,3.0,"We took the Uiryeong-gil. It was recommend as ""Nature Lover"" trail. And it was supposed to be the peak of foliage, but not that impressive at all. I think the short climb to Seoul Tower at Nansan has better view.The trail is very easy. The website says that to take this trail ,one need to register in advance. However, I guess autumn is low season, so no registration needed. The trail took us around one and a half hour to finish. You get to see the 5 peaks."
48,5.0,"I suggest to go here in the morning.  We went here after lunch. We went through different mountain peaks ands its amazing!!!  😀 wear a proper hiking outfit, hehe. Cus i just wear a casual one. 😛 and.. You know, we are still on the mountain top at about 5pm and it got really scary to be trapped above! 😝 Thank God! There are hikers who helped us go down before sun down! But its a great and memorable experience Overall!"
49,4.0,Beautiful hike can be had right within Seoul. Park is densely wooded and a moderately strenuous climb should one choose to ascend. Allow several hours to include a good hike.
50,5.0,"having been to seoul a few times, it was great to do an activity outside the city.  The walk along the fortress walls was one of the highlights of our stay.  do your research about how to access it and take your passports as it is a security area and you have to sign in and out of the wall."
51,5.0,"We climbed one of th peaks and had a terrific view of Seoul. We meet a lot of Koreans on the way (not too many though, we hiked on a Sunday). It felt like we did something Korean, and it was definitely a nice change from the noisy city."
52,5.0,You can feel the nature of Seoul. It is located at very convenient place from the center of Seoul. You can view the surrounding area of Seoul and feel the history of Korea.
53,4.0,"This was an amazing experience. The visit to the peak, the temple on the mountains and the gate were totally worth it. It's a little tricky, make sure you don't get lost. Just follow Koreans they know where to go. Or try asking at trail intersections - lots of people go through someone sooner or later would be an English speaker. Make sure to bring a 2L water bottle per person. Yes, you will need at least that much! The hike is about 5 km up with the side trail and 4 km down."
54,4.0,Did the longest trail for the hike as we alighted at the wrong stop hence wasnt very prepared for the hike. however we managed to reach the peak and all the hardwork was well worth it. It gets alittle tricky when reaching the peak but is still manageablE. there are alot of koreans and we did not see even one foreigner throughout the course. Away from the normal busy seo and into the nature it is a brand new experience indeed! Enjoyed it alot and is a good form of exercise after indulging for so many days! Better to plan it on second last day of the trip like we do as muscle ache is inevitible!
55,4.0,"Lots of things to see and do in Seoul  before heading to Bukhansan unless you are hiker like me (last here in winter 2 years ago)Getting here by public transport is not difficult via the metro and bus ( you get off at the last stop at the terminal). From the terminal you can either hike up or bus up (special bus but I reckon half hour frequency) or get a taxi up (US$4 per trip, higher tariff than city taxi). From the entrance gateway there is  only main 1 way up until 20 mins up you can get on otherside  tracks, all well signposted with proper trails. I had limited time and do only an hour hike to vantage point where i can see the stony mountain top. To get further up it will probably take another 1-2 hours further up. I came in fall late Nov this time hoping foliage like that in Mt Sorak. but only saw a patch of red sporadically. Will need to go to Mt Sorak to enjoy that. Have a good hike"
56,5.0,"This is a ""must do"" in Korea - the hike is a little strenuous, so plan accordingly (hiking shoes or good sneakers, gloves, jacket, no sandals) - the views are awesome and absolutely make the hike up well worth it.  Avoid the weekends if you can, it tends to get a little crowded, but definitely do this in Korea!"
57,5.0,We climbed along the outer wall (not too sure outer wall of what. Guide said outer wall of palace but we didn't see the palace when we climbed to the top) It took some effort and we were perspiring even though it was like 3 deg.The view from the top was gorgeous and the air so fresh and crisp even though it was freezing. Saw a number of people walking up and down and they were all quite elderly. Made me ashamed of feeling so tired and out of breath!I believe we did the easiest part of Mt Bukhansan as we were not as tired as the others stated in the reviews. But still panting and swearing (silently in our heads!) when we reached the top. Worth the effort only in winter and there are less people and less sweat. (Not much less people but still less than in autumn where it's too beautiful for words)
58,4.0,"Why don't you stop and take some break in a city with mountain climbing? There are several mountains in Seoul, but Mt.Bukhansan is the only National Park located in Seoul. 21 paths are organized for hikers or mountain climbers. Beautiful nature and fresh air are near you."
59,5.0,"This was a great hike with well demarcated signs, and everyone is quite friendly. It is moderately strenuous but you need hiking shoes and walking poles are advisable particularly on the descent. It was very pretty with the fall season coming, pretty streams and lots of beautiful vistas of the surrounding areas including the city. We took a cab to the are as they are cheap and with 4 of us it was a good value, and cabs were near the entrance for our return."
60,4.0,An excellent place to go for hiking within the City.  We took a subway and got down at Gunpul station and took a bus just outside the station.  A beautiful trekking place and you will see a lot of local people going there at weekend and to my surprise a lot of elderly peope.  The peak is about 2 KM climb.
61,5.0,"Just outside Seoul is this gem.  The Koreans take their hiking seriously and this national park is definitely something they should be proud of.  As you approach the trails, there are food vendors, street vendors and outdoor stores that have everything you might need for a day or three hiking the mountains/woods of this park.  There is even a handicapped path for those who have trouble with the rough terrain.  Tucked into the mountainside are numerous temples as well as modern buildings that house nature schools.  Even if it is a hot day, you can hike up high enough to reach the cooler altitudes.  This park is definitely worth spending at least half a day if not longer to explore the nature and history of this beautiful country."
62,5.0,"The show was so fantastic it just blew my mind. The action, the rhythm the passion of the actors and actress were so good it just kept the audience enthralled. My family all enjoyed the the show!"
63,4.0,"Great Korean hiking  experience.  We have hiked three different trails with four kids (10, 7, 5, and 2+/-).  We have a special back pack for the youngest.  Depending on the trail and time it can be busy with other hikers.  Recommend taking public transportation.  We drove one time and  had to wait a looooonnng time for parking.  Pay attention to the trail difficulties so you don't get in a tough spot pending your skill level.  I thought the trails to be reasonable marked and blogs have good information.  Pick up a map at the ranger station prior to going up and take plenty of water.  The views are great and neat sites to hike to such as temple or old fortress gates."
64,5.0,Second time to this National Park and thoroughly enjoyed our hiking experience.  Lots of hikers - old and young alike - all enjoying the experience.  Subway from Ilsan with folks dressed in full hiking gear but not actually a necessity - a truly Korean experience - get some and try to blend in.  The bus ride through Gupabal to the mountain although packed is also part of the overall Bukhansan hiking day - packed in like sardines and then off to enjoy the mountain.
65,5.0,"Be prepared for a challenge to find someone who can speak English but it is worth. The view is stunning – in all directions. My son said it was better than Grampians in Victoria and Blue Mountains in New South Wales, both in Australia. For me it was as good as the other two (I love Australia). Definitely worth going. On the way you can buy – if you need – hiking equipment. I found and amazing backpack I could not resist buying."
66,5.0,Some of the best hiking trails I've ever been on - you must try the 5 Peaks (Obong) trail or the Bukhansan mountain trail.
67,5.0,"This was one of the most beautiful hikes I have been on.  There are plenty of little shops at the bottom in case you need to hydrate or want to each.  They hike is gorgeous and the trails well maintained.  Not recommended for very small children.  However, I hiked it 5 months pregnant and my husband hiked it with a 35 pound kid on his back.  It is not very technical, but some places can be pretty step.  As with all other mountains we have been on in S. Korea, there are lots of local hiking and they are always polite and courteous.  This is a must do hike, even for the novice."
68,5.0,"we did the dobongsan to mulwongsa (spell) hike, which is about 5.5 miles.  Loved that we could walk right from the station, pass a mini shopping area and right up to the mountains.  passed a few temples on our ascent and descent.  Love the tradition of drinking and eating good food after the ascent.  5 stars for bukhansan but also hiking in Korea. If one is not a big fan of crowds, AVOID the weekends or any holidays."
69,4.0,"You can get here by taking some of the local buses up the mountain past the university and then start a hike along the fortress wall - really nice views and very interesting.  The mountain is beyond the palace in Seoul. Make sure you go early though as there are check points on the hike that close at 3pm - meaning you can't progress on the hike and will have to go back down the way you came.  This unfortunately happened to us so we didn't make it all the way along the wall, however we still enjoyed the hike that we did get in. Also not many of the people working at the park were fluent in English so communication can be more tricky."
