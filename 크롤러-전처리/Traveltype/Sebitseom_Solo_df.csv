0,3.0,"Also known as Some Sevit (섬세빛- literally means ""Three Lights Island""), this place looks amazing at night when the buildings floating by the river are lit against the dark skies. Some k-dramas have been shot here. It's quite a long walk from the subway, though. There must be a bus stop somewhere near."
1,4.0,"Very nice park.  Lots people sit on the grass, have picnic or just enjoy the view.  There is also a children's playground and bike rental."
2,3.0,"Went to see the singing bridge with fountains and lights, but I have checked this as well. Had an interesting (and overpriced) tea at CNN café and then checked all the moving lights from the outside."
