The coldness of the atmosphere did not stop us from going the Gwanghwamun gate to watch the changing of the guards. We arrived at the gate with plenty of people whose purpose was exactly like ours. After a few minutes of waiting, with clock precision, the changing of the guards started. It was fun to watch. We had some pictures taken with the guards. The event was delightfully enjoyable."

16,5.0,"If you love historical places, this is a great stop for you.  Seoul has a lot of these historical stand-alone buildings but each one is slightly different and unique.for me it was worth visiting.

23,5.0,"The Gwanghwamun Gate is right by the Sejong monument, adjacent to a museum underground that takes you through how the Korean alphabet was formed. Long story short - it's a beatiful area right near each other, and definitely one you should check out!"

29,5.0,In the middle of the city you run in to this spectacular entrance to the main Palace guarded by old style dressed guards.  Its just spectacular !
30,4.0,The gate is nice but it is the palace behind it that is the real attraction. Not worth the trip alone but if you are first at the gate you probably already plan to visit the palace as well
31,4.0,"So you go there, you see the gate (that basically looks like every other gate in seoul) and that's that. there are guards there that will take pictures with you, but not very interesting. Might be good for parents who just want some cool pics of the kids without a lot of hassel."
32,5.0,"The gate is the entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There are guards with traditional attire at the gate standing there just like a statue. At specific times, there will be guard changing ceremony. To arrive here, you can either exit from Gyeongbokgung Station (nearer) or Gwanghwamun Station (will arrive at Gwanghwamun Square first).The structure and the whole cultural experience is worth a visit."

37,4.0,The gate of entry to Gyeongbukgong Palace-I felt timewarped passing through this gate. I was lucky enough to witness changing of the guards. I thought the guards were statues! So this is how it looks like i.r.l. It was like  being an actor in Korean TV series or much like being transported back in time.Make the Gwanghamun changing of the guards part of the itinerary and take a selfie with statuesque gate guards. It's worth the experience.
38,3.0,"I would say it's one of the main landmarks of Seoul, you will probably go around it if you're going to the Gyeongbokgung palace, good photo spot."
39,5.0,This place it´s amazing you can see the history of korea! but it has a problem it clases at 4pm so take care! now it has a program with night visits so it´s good! at night it´s more beautiful!
40,5.0,These are very thick and well built gates leading into the Court yard. The first in a layer of protection from intruders.

42,4.0,"We stumbled upon the changing of the guards at 11 AM on a Friday on our way to Gyeongbokgung Palace.  This gate is one of the entrances to the palace.  The ceremony lasts only a few minutes, but is quite entertaining and it is free.  Try to time your visit to the palace to allow yourself to see it.  I think kids would especially enjoy it."
43,3.0,"The Sumunjang (Royal Guard) Changing Ceremony normally takes places at 10am/2pm for 20 minutes. On most days, you may also be able to try out the Sumungun (Gatekeeper)'s traditional outfit before and after the ceremony although we did not partake in that."
44,4.0,"the gate is nice place to take picture, great korean architect. you can watch the changing of the guard."

46,5.0,"I love this area! From the palace to the square, there's much to take in if you walk by foot. Be sure to try the national costume/ hanbok for free! There's a museum underground that's very good and interactive, without any fees! It's a great way to understand the important figures of Korea and the genius admiral."
47,4.0,"Our tour guide dropped us at Gwanghwamun Square and we wandered our way around the attraction. It was a great Korean cultural exploration beginning with the two prominent statues at the Square -  King Sejong the Great and the Great Admiral Yi Sun-sin. King Sejong was the Korean King who first adopted Hangul, the Korean alphabet while Admiral Yi defeated the Japanese in a naval battle, defended and  safeguard the territorial integrity of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. We also visited the King Sejong's museum beneath the statue of King Sejong where many magnificent artifacts of the Joseon Dynasty were displayed. Directly opposite the north of the Square was the Gwanghwamun Gate, the main gate of the Gyeongbokgong Palace. The traditional Joseon architectural style Gate look unique with the stunning Mount Bugak at the background. We were lucky to witness the royal guard changing ceremony at the Gate. I remember during my recent visit to Taiwan, I had visited Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall and witnessed the military guard changing ceremony but the guards were attired in modern military uniform. Here, at Gwanghwamun Gate, the guards were all attired in traditional colorful Korean costume (hanbok) with headgear and swords. It was so fascinating, cultural and authentic. I spent some time squeezing my way around the crowd trying to take photos from different angles. It was unique and typically Korean. It is an eye-opener and free. I was also fascinated by the huge traditional colorful Korean drum when I walk into the palace. I would say that you have not visited Seoul if you have not see this spectacular guard changing ceremony at this main Gate Gwanghwamun."
48,5.0,"Its clearly recently been rebuilt but it is still a sight to behold. If you time it right, you can catch the changing of the guards. Interesting for those from the other side of the world. I've been to Seoul numerous times and I've been here so often I've lost count. I'm still amazed every time I see it from the main road. It really stands out, especially with the mountains in the background. A must-see when visiting Seoul for sure!!"
49,4.0,"Gwanghwamun gate is an entrance main gate to see old royal residence of ancestor Kings. Vast open grounds spread over several kilometers, old buildings typical in Korean Royalty style, carefully preserved, including a museum,English, Chinese , Japanese guides are available at specified hours and there is a nominal fee to see,at noon time there is a colorful Change of Guard ceremony for about 1 hour worth watching.No food allowed inside so fill your stomach before long walks.If you stay in Seoul long enough- you can make an advance reservation to see Blue House the South Korea Presidential Residence and offices on extended grounds.After you come out nearby are statues of King Sejong and  Great Korean Warrior General S S Lee."
50,4.0,This gate is pretty but what really makes it a worthwhile trip besides seeing the actual palace is seeing the changing of the guards. It is about a 10 minute process with traditional instruments being played. It usually takes place around 2:00. It is really cool to see and make sure you get pictures with the guards too!
51,4.0,"It's just in front of the gyeongbokgung palace. In the day time, there's performance to show and revive the history. You can view the performance that's similar to change of guards and thereafter take photos with the performers. In the evening, this place is beautifully lighted up. It's so beautiful that if you are around this area, I would suggest that you go to the Gwanghwamun Gate again to take a photo."
52,5.0,"Interesting place to see how the guards changes with ceremonial activity... It has schedule for this... Like english guards, the korean guards were also like statue, its hard to make them interact with us even for a smile...  People inside are provided few spaces with some kind yellow lines during the ceremony so they can choose at which angle they can see the attraction... It feels like we're at the old times... Love it!"
53,4.0,entrance to more palaces! you can visit the place half day if you walk fast. you can also view changing of guards inside
54,4.0,"This is the main gate to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It can be reached by metro orange line 3.  Get off at Gyeongbokgung station and take exit 5.  it will bring you right in front of the Palace and the gate.  You can visit the Palace and watch the changing of the guard, but to me looking out from in front of the gate is the most impressive site.  It looks right down Gwanghwamun Square.  A wide plaza with multi lanes of traffic on each side.  A Champs élysées if you like.  The square has 2 prominent statutes, King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin.  The latter has a multi water fountain with kids splashing about.  Great photo op.  There are a number of cultural buildings including the center for the performing arts, concert hall, theaters, and Museum of Korean History.  Also included are a number of foreign embassy's .  In good weather you might find some entertainment or faire going on in the wide square.  Should walk it at least once."
55,4.0,The original was constructed in 1395 this one is a reconstruction and is used as the main entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace and where the changing of the guards occur daily so it should be seen - also check out the Statue of King Sejong in the middle of the square and the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin (cant really be missed!)
56,4.0,"The Gwanghwamun  (or Gwang-Hwa-Mun) PlazaOne cannot help but to compare the Gwanghwamun Plaza of Seoul with the Trafalgar Square of London, where The Nelson’s Column was erected to commemorate Admiral Horatio who died in the battle Trafalgar. The imposing status of Admiral Yi Sun Sin, a highly decorated and much revered, or even worshipped Korean naval commander, a legendary national hero, stands majestically at southern end of Gwanghwamun Plaza.  The second important and imperial status of Sejong Da Wang, or King Sejong the Great, is placed magnificently at the centre of the Plaza.  Standing at this strategic point, visitors can visit or soak in the panoramic view of many modern and historical buildings, such as the cultural exhibition centre, the office blocks of various agencies of the Central Government on the left (west), the famous Cheong Deo Gung Palace complex which is within walking distance in the east, the Residence of the President, the Blue House and the tallest landmark of Seoul, the Bakhansan (mountain) visible in the north."
57,5.0,"We walked from Gate Gwanghwamun along the Main Street passing the beautiful monuments as we went. In Gwanghwamun Square we were able to dress up as royalty, (for free) and take our own pictures in the Square. We then continued along the Main Street to the end which is just a short walk to Cheonggye Plaza and the beginning of the famous Cheonggyecheon Stream. This was a great way to see the gate, square and stream. Have fun as you walk, talk and discover the past in the present!"
58,5.0,"It is the centre of Seoul, of course should come have a look. Have a walk with a couple of friends at here, take some photo and walk and run around at the centre of Seoul, is kinda amazing"
59,4.0,"This place has always been one of the places I want to visit in Seoul, due to the numerous variety shows that constantly feature this iconic landmark representative of Seoul and even Korea. My first impression of this place is ""New York City's Times Square minus the skyscrapers and buzzing crowd"", because the plaza is situated in the middle of the avenue. It is really a beautiful scene, perfect for photos. The gate itself is magnificent, and inside it is a big open area where the change of guard ceremony is held. Things to do: Take photos with the iconic Admiral Yi Sun Shin and King Sejong. Then head underground to learn more about the king and his contributions to the country. Then head to the main attraction: Gwanghuamun. Catch the royal change of guards ceremony (if I'm not wrong it should be held at around 12 or 1230...), then go visit the Gyeongbokgung housed within."
