This time, the sakura season was right on and Seokchon Lake is one of the hot spots to view cherry blossoms. I avoided Sunday and went on a Monday, but still there were many people (a week- long sakura festival was on). The flowers there were mostly white. I walked around the east lake, and Lotte World Tower is particularly photogenic with cherry blossoms all around. In the evening, when the lights were turned on, it's another atmosphere.Outside the sakura season, the lake is a nice place to stroll around leisurely."

Went there first week of April and center of Seoul didnt have bunch of cherry blossoms so I was kinda disappointed until I went to Seokchon Lake. It was the best thing that met my eyes that week. Must go-to when you visit Seoul in Spring."

4,4.0,"The lake is most attractive in early April, with the lakeside lined with handsome cherry blossoms. In autumn, however, it is less attractive, despite some red autumn leaves lining the lake. I like to visit the lake around sunset, because it is the most romantic time. For the first timers it is quite difficult to find the entrance to the lake. The lake is sort of divided by a road bridge above, but one could walk around the lake from any entrance. I like to take Exit 2 of the Jamsil metro station, then turn left and walk alongside Lotte Hotel, until the road junction. Cross the road and then cross again, to reach the diagonally opposite road corner; the access path to the lake and the coffee shop is right there (next to another ""Exit 2""). This second Exit 2 is for the Bus Transfer Station and not for the metro. The confusion for the first timer is that there are two ""Exit 2"" entrances. It took me a while to work it out."

Also the place is nearby the lotto world, there is a beautiful view in the middle of the lake.  If I can come again, I must bring my girlfriend here.  這是個很棒的地方，裡面的公園就有重訓器材，可以做免費的訓練，也促進韓國人民的健康，在這做完訓練後還可以沿著湖邊的路跑步，很大一圈，沿途的風景也很漂亮，因為鄰近樂天世界，所以有許多情侶們在這約會，有機會再來的話我一定要帶自己的女友到這！"

7,5.0,"A beautiful, breathtaking, soothing the eyes' park. Best to visit during the cherry blossom season. 200m away from Jamsil Station Exit 2 or with Lotte Mall on your left, walk straight for 5-10mins until you reach the intersection. You will see the park after the trafic light."

9,4.0,"I went here recently just to see the Super Moon floats on the lake, it was like an art exhibition by Los Angeles-based artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The exhibition only last for 1 month (Sept 1- Oct 3 2016). To reach here, alight at Jamsil Station (exit 1), and walk around 5mins by following the signboard. The moon itself will lights up starting from 6pm until 10pm everyday. During that time, this area was so crowded with peoples came here to see the lights changes colour for 4hours. But to avoid the crowd, I came here during the day, lol. Few pictures with the moon is enough for me, plus I got to do some morning walk around the lake too."
