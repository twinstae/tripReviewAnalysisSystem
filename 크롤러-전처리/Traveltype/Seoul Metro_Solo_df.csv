0,3.0,Dont ride it during rush hours and line 1 smells and rides like a third world subway. Remember to get a transfer ticket or one way ticket. User friendly transport cards or tickets at every major exit passed the turnstiles. You can always go to the special exit and push the button and act stupid and speak English to get a free exit or entrance once in awhile.
1,5.0,"If this isn't the best metro in the world, then I don't know what is. Convenient, clean and consistently on time. A great way to get around Seoul."
2,5.0,"One of the best thing that you should try to experience in Korea, inside the train is very clean and also it run so fast. Its very accessible to everyone.  Huge and spacious inside the train. So if your in hurry or to avoid traffic this one is the best for you."
3,3.0,"Taking the train around Seoul is quite an eye opening experience. Unlike Japan, everything inside the different stations are written in Korean and translating to where you as a foreigner wants to go to is such a major headache...even with Google maps. Wished they had an app that could translate their Korean written maps into English or other languages, so as to make it faster to get to where you need to go....all in all korail works great for those that can get through the translation fast enough ..."
4,5.0,Took a bit of time to figure out that credit cards are not accepted. Found an ATM and then all was good. Relatively easy to use and the quality of the cars exceptional. Much smoother and easier to use than surface transport.
5,5.0,After riding all the big metros around the world i feel Seoul metro is one of the best..kakao metro app helped tho and all the climbing in and out is there but its relativley easier and best mode of transport..esp in winter!
6,5.0,"Works fantastic! It's very easy, colors, numbers, names. Same as in London, Paris, Japan. If you're here for a few days, get a Tmoney card, most rides are 1250won. Transfers are easy to find. Metro comes regularly. And oh I LOVE the announcement sound when the train is approaching haha."
7,5.0,"Easy to navigate, English is available. Just one problem, it is a bit hard to navigate the exit gate especially if it's your first time here. Need to use a few times to get used to it."
8,5.0,"Seoul’s metro is amazing, clean and very affordable. It covers all Seoul and surrounded cities and is the fastest way to travel in SK."
9,4.0,"I love the Seoul metro.  It’s clean, cheap, relatively easy to understand, and extends far into the hinterlands around Seoul.  Inside the Seoul metro area I think it is very competitive with cars and riding is generally as fast as driving.English is everywhere and am English speaker can easily use the metro, though specifics like express trains and branch line service can be hard to spot without a little Korean."
10,5.0,This is the best subway system in the world! So clean and fast. You can go to anywhere in Seoul very cheap and conveniently! It is a major accomplishment of this great country!
11,5.0,"Cheap:For 1250 won you can go all over the stations without exiting. If you’d take 2 buses, you’ve to pay 1200 per each bus.Easy:There are signs in Latin letters so you won’t get lost.Fast and can be used up to 100km range.With 2 connections, I took the metro for 1250 won from Itaewon Seoul to suwon. It took an hour ( other trains takes about 30 mins, pay at least 2500 won)."
12,5.0,"Also, reliable, safe, people follow the rules and are quick to help out.  It really is the best way to get around Seoul.  Keep in mind that Google Maps does not include the Metro when figuring out routes and will always direct you to the local buses... which are also very good.  I believe the Baidu app does include the Metro though.  So download that.  It works much better in Asia."
13,5.0,"The metro in Seoul is really great value for money. It is convenient with stations close to most attractions and shopping areas. And it is fast and punctual! I downloaded an app called Naver Map, which gives you details to plan your route in advance. Use it and I promise you will not get lost."
14,4.0,"Clean, efficient, inexpensive and easy to get around using the Metro.  Signage, verbal notices ( in English) make it easy.  Don’t forget to turn your ticket back in after the trip to get your deposit back."
15,5.0,A tourist metro card works on buses and subway. The Naver map app tells you exactly what bus or subway to take to get to your destination.  You sometimes have to put the destination in in Korean (copy paste from Google search).
16,4.0,"Take some time to study your detonation and look at train directions. Unlike Hing Kong and London,  Seoul's subways are linear not circular. On the pillars you can find stop in both directions (normally at the foot of the stairs) tells you the stop each train takes (leftside / rightside)The ticket vending machines offer Korean English and Japanese maybe Chinese but I was not paying attention lolI tried to dump my coins but after ₩2,000 it spit them out and I had to start over, lesson learned.  It did take ₩1,700 You pay a deposit for the card and on exit the platform and swipe your card, there is a machine on deposit your used cards for a 500 refund"
17,5.0,"A well organised system and very cheap! Signage is clear, colour coded and in Koean and english with announcements also in chinese and Japanese. Never waited more than 5 min."
18,5.0,"Fantastic system. Get your t card and you can go anywhere. However, each station has multiple exits. Pay attention to which exit you need. It is all on google maps."
19,5.0,"the subway is intuitive for those who have traveled by public transpo.go near a t.v. monitor above one of the doors so you can see the English translation walking between stations underground is ample shopping, convenience stores, bakeshops, subway street food, artworkimmaculately clean public toilets.  new York city's bathrooms ate garbage dumps in comparison observe the bomb shelter preparedness.....and emergency kits"
20,4.0,"I am really impressed that they announce each stop in four languages.  The four languages are Korean, then English, then Chinese and finally Japanese. The reason I give it four stars is because at least at the stations I was at, there were NO elevators or escalators to go outside and I had to climb flights of stairs with my suitcase.  Just be aware of this when you come and visit and you take the metro.  You will have to climb up and walk down many stairs at some stations."
21,5.0,Seoul metro goes all over the metro  area. Very inexpensive and reliable.  A little confusing sometimes on transfers but english signs everywhere.
22,5.0,"Use the Moovit app to make it easier. It’ll tell you the next station from yours, so you know which direction train to take."
23,5.0,"So easy from one place to others! Apps is supported, for you to more understanding. Also show the connecting with bus system!Very convincing!"
24,4.0,"Once you get used to the colours of the lines, very easy to use.. would put Naver maps on your phone as a bit more accurate than google maps. Make sure you buy a T Card as itll save you time and money trying to figure out the ticket.. You can get them from the airports CU, 7-11 just ask for 1 and how much you are putting on the card."
25,5.0,"At first I was a bit taken about by the Seoul metro.  The route map was really extensive and each station has a number. But after a short while, getting to places in straight forward. Seoul Metro stations are HUGE.  Some have areas that serve as shopping malls (largely for women). They seemed to have dug deep and far. You could be walking a fair distance to transfer from one line to another. The trains are comfortable and spacious (especially by London standards) and not as tightly packed like London or Hong Kong. But then again, the journeys aren't as stressful. Language wise, announcements are made in Korean, English, Manderin and Japanese. There is little pushing, Koreans are very polite and orderly. Again, unlike London and Hong Kong. There is usually a seat free, but it's custom to give to older people. This is often obused in Hong Kong, usually by youths and mainland tourists. But in Korea, its expected and there are seats at the end of the carriage that are specifically for old people and you're not allowed to sit on them unless there are no old people. Even then, most people will avoid them. There is little chatter and despite the amount of people, it's not noisy. Don't worry, the trains are long and cone at regular intervals. Safety is not really a concern, it seems most are law-abiding. The stations are clean (the aged ones don't seem it, but are) and some platforms have stalls selling food, drink or clothes. What's really considerate are the cupboards and racks that contain breathing apparatus and torches, in case of an emergency. That's really thoughtful. I can't see it bring done in London, due to budget or health & safety reasons. In Hong Kong, they'd be vandalised by youths or taken as souvenirs by mainland tourists.  The Seoul metro isn't just a metro system, its pretty much a regional rail service in its own right. Just remember to get your T-money card."
26,5.0,It's very simple to follow so you can get to your destination quick. Signs also have English equivalent so its not that complicated. Cheaper than taking the taxi.
27,4.0,A bit confusing but with english translated signs and the best way of quick traveling .. A tip is to take photos of your start point as well as from your willing destination and you will survive..
28,5.0,"The metro is the best way to get around the city. For a low price you can go to all parts of the city including both airports. Seoul shares the system with the city of Inchon. So you can also get to most of Inchon as well. The blue line number 1 train also runs to uijonbu to the north and suwon city and pyongtek south of Seoul. The stations are safe and clean many of which have underground shopping centers. It's very easy to get around. Signs are all in Korean and English.  Station and train announcements are in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
29,3.0,Not the easiest metro to navigate but with the help of Naver it is easier. You must get a T Money card for it work best. But after a few days got the hang of it all and worked perfectly
30,4.0,"very good punctual service, it does get busy at peak hours, I actually like to use it at quieter times of the day when it is easier to get a seat, the carriages are kept clean and I would recommend it"
31,5.0,"While not as good as the Tokyo Metro, in my opinion, the Seoul Metro is still one of the best in the world and depending on the day, I'd put it at number 2 or 3. Very clean, very fast and very efficient. Cost effective as well. One downside is that the people who ride it are not as quiet and reserved as in Japan and you will hear lots of people on their mobiles or being loud."
32,4.0,You can find everything you need in English to get around. Taxis in Seoul are difficult to hail as there are restriction as to where they can stop so you really have to find a taxi stand and taxi drivers English can be limited. Buses are an adventure if you don't have a Korean speaking guide but they are cheep. So all in all the subway was my prefered method of getting around.
33,5.0,Easy to navigate. Even easier if you download one of many Korean metro/subway map apps. The metro is also clean and has good seating.
34,5.0,"Can’t recommend this highly enough; very easy to use, inexpensive and if you can get the recharge pass - very convenient for travel across the city."
35,4.0,I have travelled around the world and find the Seoul metro very user friendly. Not knowing any Korean I can still find my way around the city easily.
36,4.0,"I have a really bad sense of direction,  but the Seoul metro made it quite easy to get around. Available in 4 languages, workers also help people with friendliness."
37,5.0,Lines are color coded and numbered. Monitors show where the train is between stops so you know how long to the next one. All stops on a line are numbered. Announcements are made in Korean and in English. You can buy tickets at the machines in English as well. Super easy!
38,5.0,"Awesome metro.  9 different lines criss-crossing the city.  There is nothing you can't get to by using the metro.  Purchasing a single use ticket is easy - there is an English option adlnd you can simply select your destination.  Fares are cheap, and you pay a 500 won deposit on the card which can be easily refunded at your destinatation.  Make sure to have some 1000 won notes because some ticket machines didn't accept any notes with a higher denomination. Make sure you know both your line (color and number) and the end of the line for the direction you are heading (to be sure you get on the right direction train).  There are displays and announcements on the train (Korean and English) so you won't miss your stop. Transfers are relatively easy, with plenty of English signage.  Each station has neighborhood maps so you can work out the best place to exit.  No need for timetables - next train is never more than a few minutes away.  Compares favourably metros in HK, Japan and Singapore as one of the best networks in Asia. If only Melbourne had one ☹"
39,5.0,"I’ve been traveled many places and Seoul metro is one of the best metro system in the world. It is convenient and has 4 languages services: Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. Each lines has their own color and you can follow the color if you want to transfer to other lines. One thing you have to keep in your mind as a tourist, DO NOT Use it during the rush hours. You will see pure hell. Line 1: super old and can be confusing. Line 1 goes to either Incheon or Cheonan and you need to be careful when you get on. You can use this line for Seoul station. Line 2: circle around Seoul. It goes all most every shopping attractions - Hongdae, Gangnam, Myeongdong, etc Like 9: don’t use it during rush hour. You will be suffocated by people. Especially express line 9 is hell."
40,5.0,"The Seoul metro is easy to use, good value, safe and very clean.  It also allows you to avoid the famous traffic on the roads to get to place easier and faster.Multiple connecting networks get you to all parts of Seoul including to Incheon and Gimpo airports and transferring between lines is easy with well marked signsNot just for the budget conscious, it is a convenient way to travel in Seoul"
41,4.0,The Seoul metro is one of the best ways to get around Seoul. Prices are cheap and trains run frequently and are clean!!
42,5.0,Everything is color coded. Super easy to navigate. Subway Korea and KakaoMetro are great apps the navigate system.
43,5.0,"One of the best public transport system in the world. Not joking. Super easy to find, to transfer, everything’s written in English. Love it. Download kakao metro app, it will save you the hassle."
44,4.0,"An extensive network that takes you to all parts of Seoul. It's a cheap and efficient way to get around town. The single journey tickets have a 500 Won deposit, redeemable at your destination. It encourages recycling but is time-consuming when you are in a rush."
45,5.0,"I love metro in seoul. Fast and easy. You can go whenever you want, air conditioner inside, easy to buy card."
46,5.0,Seoul Metro is hands down one of the best in the world.  Organized and always on time.  Clean and easy to navigate.  For older or infirmed commuters might not that great due some of the stations have great stairs to climb.  Elevators are not available at all times.  Be informed.
47,4.0,"I always rely on subway to travel when overseas. Seoul subway is efficient, clean and modern. Highly recommend to get a T money card, which can also be used in buses. Glad to know the T money card has no expiry date. Each subway trip costs 1,250 won. There is rebate if one transfers between subway & bus."
48,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is so easy to ride, understand, and use. My best advice is to download Naver Maps (there is an English version) which will tell you exactly where you need to go, which platforms and even which direction. And most of all it is INCREDIBLY affordable."
49,4.0,Good system - I have travelled on a lit of underground systems in the world and this measures up. Though I did manage to get on wrong train once. Trains are clean and run regularly.
50,4.0,"A good way to get around town. The trumpet fanfare that plays when the train is pulling up is hilarious. If you buy a single ticket you must turn it in at the end of the ride. If you are taking it a lot, then buying a multi-pass is a good idea but there's a non-refundable deposit."
51,4.0,"Although it could improve more in some spots such as the screens and the arrival calls, the metro service is very convenient for a person visiting Seoul for the first time."
52,5.0,"The metro is well connected and the cheapest way to commute. Also, it is the fastest. The metro map is easy to understand"
53,5.0,on-time and so affordable buy a T money card at the airport on arrival (and probably other places in the city) and just make your life so easy
54,5.0,"Transportation in South Korea? The first answer is.. Metro Train. Please download subway map and install in your mobile phone. This apps can set the from, destination and it will give you estimated travel time, cost and best train rail ways. The best of this stations are, every station has at least minimum 4 exits and maximum 11 exists so far i see from the station i went. Every station has T-money card reload kiosk machine which located usually on basement 1st floor. This kiosk machine has English option so just easy way to reload and only has option to reload using case (coin/paper). Remember some subway has 5 basement levels which the lowest use for train. There are shopping places too. The navigation and labels of the station all in both Korean and English which is easy for all tourist to follow and understand. However its hard to find ""Information"" counter for each station. I would say you need to walk alot when using this subway. For those has disabled parties or walking problem (knee pain,etc) not really advisable to use subway cause you'll need to walk a lot within the subway entrance and exit itself. Seoul station is one of main inter-station where you can take express train and bus for long journey. Every places has kiosk machine."
55,3.0,"So many stops, so many lines, so big.Even the stations are big, you can have 15 entrances in one station, very difficult to take the right one.Better remember the way out your hotel is located, otherwise very difficult to find. I went out at a wrong entrance and somebody told me to take a taxi to go to my hotel .... imagine the distance."
56,5.0,"For an english speaker that had a lot of trouble trying to learn Hangul; the Seoul Metro really seemed to be the best way to get around. I recommend you spend a bit of time researching the system online first as well as downloading the smartphone app to be able to find and identify stations. I used a combination of the app along with Google directions and the 3D maps on the walls of the stations to get around. Use Google to find general directions and thew app to identify stations. Each station has a number and they are in numerical order along the individual lines. By knowing the number of your station on the line you are travelling and comparing it with the signs on the walls showing the numbers of the station you are in along with the one in either direction you can tell if you are going in the correct direction. It is also a good idea to know the station at the line ends as this is what is displayed on the destination signs. After the first couple of times it makes sense.There is good access to most of the city and it is quite inexpensive. I recommend the Korea Tour card which costs 4000 won (1000 won = around 1 USD) and can be added to as needed. In total over my week I used 30000 won for a lot of getting around. Tap the card getting on and off and you won't be charged for transfers to connecting buses.The trains are clean and the people are very polite with it being common for people to offer their seats. All stations I went through had restrooms that were well marked. The signage was all in English as well as Korean.One thing that may be a bit different is that there are no where near the number of escalators as other systems I have used. There are elevators available but you need to route yourself accordingly to use them. It was only an issue for me when I was hauling the suitcase arriving and leaving. The stairs and tunnels can be quite long though, so anyone with mobility issues should be prepared to scout out the stations to make sure they can find and use the elevators.The number of lines ensure good coverage of the city. All in all, having a public transit background in Toronto, I was impressed and though it was a valuable tool to exploring and enjoying the city."
57,3.0,"I have often used the Seoul Metro to get around during my three visits to this marvelous city and I have yet to master the system. The app hasn't worked for me nor a detailed metro map. The problem occurs as soon as I enter a station. The poor signage (in English and Korean) fails to clearly show where to go to get a train heading in the  needed direction. I often chose incorrectly and had to exit the platform and use another ticket to get to the correct one. Some platforms fail to show all the stops, just the next one, which only was helpful if I planned to get off at that stop. When I eventually reached my destination, I often had to climb myriad stairs to get outside. Though I sometimes found an elevator, it generally did not lead to where I needed to be. Escalators exist in some places but some were out of order.On my first visit to Seoul, I quickly learned to avoid the metro until 10 a.m. and between 5 and 7 p.m., because those seem to be the busiest hours. Otherwise, I rarely experienced crowded conditions. Other passengers have always been courteous to me and many have stopped to assist when I was obviously lost. One man walked with me for about 10 minutes to ensure that I got on the correct train.I generally was able to get a seat in the car I entered, and the cars I rode in were clean. A recording in Korean, followed by English, alerts passengers to the next stop. Instructions at ticket machines are in Korean and English.Sometimes I had no problems in getting from point A to point B on the metro. But because that was never a sure thing, I walked whenever possible."
58,4.0,Seoul metro is the best way to getting around in seoul on time and cost effect way to sightseeing. Only issue for foreigners is to make sure you have good subway map .
59,5.0,"This is a must see. The history, the beauty, the experience is something everyone should have a chance to experience. The changing of the guard ceremony is worth getting there before 10:00 am."
60,4.0,"I was taking subway from seoul to myeongdong with my luggage. Lots of steps and at couple locations, escalator in maintenance. I had help at seoul station to buy ticket (machine didnt take my note) and the station lady was very helpful. Otherwise the subway was fast and efficient."
61,4.0,"I ventured cross town on the metro. It’s cheap, about $1 per ride, and east to use. Well signed. Gets crowded at rush hours.  Signage is good and doubled in English."
62,5.0,"Clean,super reliable and convenient!     You can go almost anywhere in Seoul using the metro.   It is comparable in quality to the ones in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore."
63,4.0,I never saw such a bigger metro in the world !!!!! About 360 stations plus trains .....easy to lost yourself specially in this nearly ALL Korean language lol
64,5.0,"I was initially unsure as to how easy it would be to navigate around not being able to understand Korean. However, all the ticket machines work in English, all the signs are easy to understand and colour coded for the different lines.It's great value and you can also buy travel passes which are re-loadable. Most fares are around £1/$1 single so its a great way to get around. If you do get into difficulty and get stuck at a barrier for example then the station staff are incredibly helpful and polite."
65,5.0,"It was my first time in Seoul but riding the Seoul Metro was an easy thing because all the signages have English translations for foreign travelers. Also, the exits and transfer signs are easy to follow. Very impressive!"
66,5.0,"I travel a lot and this is a huge system.Very cheap to use.In the trains it is in Korean but they usually have an English speaking lady who will tell you what station is coming up.You can download a free english version of the entire network from Play Store called Korea Rail.It is very easy to follow.Working out which exit to leave the station is important because you can end up a long way from where you need to be.If you are here for a while you can get a ""Safex""card from a convenience store of station master for 4000 won and then recharge it.It is more convenient than buying individual tickets."
67,5.0,One of the best metros I’ve ever seen worldwide. Lots of people but lots of trains running around in a short amount of time. Very good!
68,4.0,"A great way to get around, even for someone with limited Korean language skills.Tip - Download their app - it's easy to use and makes figuring out which trains you need and how they connect a simple task."
69,4.0,"It is practical, well signed, the only thing, the names in English are small but still if you go close, it may be easier to go through. Only one thing I noted, some stations, you need to check first to which side you want to go. I think it was Sinchon, there were entrances on both sides and therefore I got into the closest entrance to realize I needed to go the other platform but you needed to go out again. A local person did the same mistake and was trying to cross back to the other side. Just pay attention and it will be ok."
70,4.0,"As in every city as large as Seoul the Metro is the best way to travel even if the taxis are relatively cheap. Best is to buy as T-card and top up the amount on this card, which goes very easy.  Furthermore I can recommend to download the app for the metro which is also available in English and which is a good tool to quickly check the best route from A to B. I travelled a lot with the metro and spend about 15.000 Won so quite cheap and practical"

72,4.0,"As a non Korean speaking visitor, I found the Metro to be very easy to use. It's well signed in English. I particularly like the fact that the next station is marked on the platforms so you can't go the wrong way  Trains are frequent. The Seoul Subway App is excellent."
73,4.0,"well lit, well displayed signage in English for tourists. The app works great too. Just the walking while changing lines takes the air out of you at times. Staff at various stations were friendly."
74,5.0,"The Seoul metro is clean, organized and easy. I used the Naver app to find my way around Seoul. You can purchase a tourist metro card from a machine and then use another machine to load money into it. You check in and out as you enter and exit the metro."
75,5.0,It is a very simple metro system in comparison to Japan. Also very clean and easy to understand. The people are nice and was never overly crowded. I took it late night though.
76,5.0,"Seoul subway is a very comprehensive system that takes you anywhere easily. With the subway map in hand, most places of interest  are within walking distance. One thing to note is, you must be sure you get through the right gantry or you will be charged for the trip though you may not have taken the ride."
77,5.0,"Avoid office hours 8~9:30 AM and 6:30-7 pm especially line no 2, clean and ontime as always, best alternative if you wanna avoid Seoul traffic"
78,5.0,"Seoul Metro or subway system is one of the most convenient mode of transport in the world. Well maybe just a little confusing during the change of lines/transfer inside the stations. But overall, you can access to anywhere in Seoul."
79,5.0,"It`s super easy to use, even to buy the tickets or recharge the card.  And the train is very clean, impressive."
80,5.0,cheap and easy to travel around seoul. use the single tickets for trips. Do beware that you cannot transfer with the single use tickets
81,4.0,Classic “postage stamp” system. All the signage is great for English-speakers. Use a T-Money card. Trains are frequent. I never waited more than a few minutes.
82,5.0,Would be hard as all metros without google and trip advisor. Clean as and very safe to use. Some very friendly staff. Machines easy to use for multi-language users Well done !
83,5.0,"buying their subway T-Card, if buy single trip, you may get back your deposit but not the load up card.  the T-Card only is 3000won, the you have to load.  Very efficient and on time...extremely clean...people on the subway very friendly..."
84,5.0,Very best public transport to use and easy for those who love to have a connection to the place of interest because the station is near to the place that we want to go.For me i took a metro from itaewon to Olympic Park and its walking distance from station to the park. They have a information counter for tourist.
85,5.0,"Seoul Metro is the easiest and most economical way to get around Seoul.  There is no need to take taxis as there is almost always a station near by.  Pro tip: get s T-Money card (a prepaid card that can be used on public transportation, 7-11s and even some music venues).  Download Kakao Metro app to guide you around the city."
86,5.0,"Seoul subway is superb, comfortable, safe and fast. It has a lot of branches, but you can’t get lost. The clues will help you to find needed line and train. Each branch has its own colour; in the subway all of the indexes are in English, Korean, which are definitely necessary for foreigners. Trains coming are behind a glass doors, which open when the train is came. That is the main reason of safeness. You can download subway map, but what are you going to do if your phone will no work anymore? Koreans provided stations and trains with maps. Also the next stations are gonna be announced by woman’s voice. So you can’t miss your station. Besides subway has Wi-Fi, but often this connection could be lost. It’s beneficial to buy T-money card in any convenient store, or in some special machines. It gives discounts during movings between stations and you are able to pay in buses and some taxes. Sometimes metro looked like giant shopping mall, because of having shops to the expensive with cosmetics."
87,5.0,"great for going across the city, minuses was the metro does not have a day pass which is common for most metros especially for tourists"
88,4.0,Seoul has very good connectivity of Metro(Subway) throughout the city. But it can be little confusing for foreigners. Don't hesitate to ask your doubts to any local about metro or station.
89,5.0,"I found the Seoul metro very easy to use. All the signs are in English, the announcement are in English the train is clean and quiet. Korean people fairly polite al though they honor zero personal space. So don’t be surprised when they star d really close or bump into frequently. Recommend downloading KakaoMetro app for assisted trip planning. Pretty accurate."
90,3.0,"The train is quite fast and time efficient, the only thing is that when it's time where there's a lot of old lady and old guy on board, then thing could be a little bit s*cks.  The old ladies will just push you and even won't say sorry when you got hurt because of them (They pushed me until I fell into the platform hole of the train, and no one help me getting up. Lucky I'm fast enough, other I can't imagine what will happen to me >.<), and the old guys are too racist. I'm with a group of Chinese and Japanese friends when one of my Japanese friend suddenly got scolded and hit by the old guy because she speak something in Japanese. Other than that, it's okay..."
91,4.0,The Seoul Metro is the most convenient mode of transportation in the city. Connections are convenient and you can easily get from one place to another within minutes. It is also a good way to get around to avoid the traffic jams in the city. Price of tickets are fairly reasonable.

Many passenger friendly features and amenities are installed on all stations for convenience."
93,5.0,"Seoul metro is the most awesome transportation I have ever taken. The design and expertise skills that was brought on to create Seoul Metro is magic!!!! It is one of the best public transportation I have ever taken in my life!!!! It is easy to navigate, and also in English. Every lines connects with each other, and I have to say I can never get lost, using Seoul Metro xoxo!!! Every tourists cannot go missing from using Seoul Metro, or get lost. Just follow the rules and download the Seoul metro app, or use Kakao subway, that is the best app now. Tourists cannot go wrong using Seoul metro, so easy to travel and fare are reasonable price too."
94,5.0,"I absolutely love riding the Seoul metro. It's very convenient, fast, on time and clean. My tip when you're travelling to Korea is download the subway app. It will tell you the departure and arrival of the train, how much the fare is, where the door exit will be and the fastest way to get fo your destination. It has an english version and you can use it everywhere in Korea not just in Seoul."
95,4.0,Overall it feels very safe and clean; understandably it may look a bit dated as the oldest line opened in 1974. There are altogether 22 lines (including the line to Incheon and Gyeonggi).  It is possible to get to Gimpo Airport or Incheon Airport by the metro. The operation hours are from 5.30am to around midnight. Using T Money (a rechargeable transit card) is highly recommended.
96,5.0,...for the first time.  Really user friendly for a non Korean speaker. All you need is a train map and buying a single journey ticket is easy using the automated machines.  The metro makes it real simple for foreigners.  I was going to give my review a mark lower because this strange little man came up and stood very close to me where I was sitting.  Not sure why as the train is not crowded at all.  It isn't fair to judge the whole Metro System on him though.  Wait he just got off at the same stop I did...
97,5.0,"I found the Seoul's metro very efficient, fast, and clean. The people are polite and riding it is a pleasant experience. It's logic and easy to use."
98,5.0,The Seoul Metro made my stay in Seoul much more pleasant.  Plenty of stops and easy to use.  Signs all over the place.
99,5.0,"Use it, because when in Rome... Very simple and budget friendly. Just to warn you, sometimes strong smell of kimchi inside :)"
100,5.0,"Great subway.  I debated about getting a T money card, however as I was only in Seoul for 1 ½ days I just bought tickets as needed.  It was so easy using the ticket machines.  Just select where you are going, how many tickets and insert your cash and there is your ticket.  There were machines for refunding your 500 won ticket deposit after your trip.  Signage and announcements in English made it very easy to get around."
101,5.0,"You can reach just about everywhere by subway, although you may have to change lines once or twice.  Make sure you have a subway map.  The trains flash up the name of each, and the next, station, in English, but only briefly and if the train is crowded it can be difficult to see the screen.  There were toilets at all the stations I visited and they were spotlessly clean."
102,4.0,"Honestly, for the most part Seoul subway lines are one of the easiest to find your way around because of the English signs that are well marked and pain free throughout the system.  Most fares are the same price and transfers to other subway lines and buses are generally free unless you are traveling a long distance i.e. maybe add 200 won to your trip. Majortity of time, use Kakao metro app and use final destination/stop as a guide meaning if it goes to end of that line then it will stop at your stop along the way. Nice, that I haven't experienced an off loading because the subway train broke down like other systems worldwide. Only cons are sometimes transfers in some stations take 7-10 minutes to walk to other lines. Also, the older the line the less modern it is so line 6 and up are the better and cleaner. But, yeah mind the gap and you all good 👍.Airport line is great if you are flying in to Incheon airport because for 7-8000 won - it will get you into Seoul under an hour.  Keep in mind avoid rush hours because you will feel like a sardine and there is no such thing as personal space here. Cheers."
103,5.0,"i came to work by  this metro for 5 months and all enjoyed my times here . It is very nice , safe and on time . it is also very easy for use even you do not speak korean and the cost is very cheap . highly recommend to explore the city by use this metro"
104,5.0,"Seoul Metro, from anywhere to anywhere!  So easy in English to korean! I visited for a month! never took a taxi or a bus, only the subway!  everywhere! and not expensive at all. Fast and clean, from the Airport in Seoul all the way to the hotel basement!  And I always got to seat, because the younger people would get up and let me "" old person"" seat down.  but don't sit in the pink seats they seems to be for ladies with babies, It was easy to buy the tickets and I soon found out the used tickets you put back into the machines  and get some money back. Maps for the metro are everywhere and in both korean and english, easy to read! I can't wait to go back and ride the metro in Seoul and everywhere, Thank you Seoul Metro"
105,3.0,"The metro is clean, safe and cheap. Its a convenient way to go around Seoul but not most friendliest metros for visitors who don't speak Korean. The signs are usually in Korean and in English, but the English signs are very small and hard to notice in some places and in some places they don't exist. I always had to double check, check the map or app all the time. The Kakao Metro app was very useful and easy to use, and the token vending machine was also very easy to use.Traveling from one place to another place often required 2-3 line changes,and each time had to wait about 3-5 min. It took me about 45 min or so to travel from distance to another."
106,4.0,"It is the best metro i have ever experienced. For reference, i experienced metro from more than 10 country. Even though i am a local people in seoul, i feel excited when i hear the BGM of transfer station."
107,5.0,"Taking Seoul Metro subway system is one of the best way to enjoy Seoul. First of all, it's convenient and time-saving. You can get to almost tour site on time. Second of aĺl, it's the lowest fare among many transportation system. You can transfer several times without extra fare, in case within limited transfer time allowance, say 2-3 hours. Furthermore, you can transfer metro to bus by just scanning. Lastly, Seoul metro is the easiest way to find your destination. All of the metro stations are clearly introduced in english. Hope you guys enjoy your trip in Seoul!"
108,5.0,"Very convenient. There are stops at most major places. The metros are well connected so transiting between stations is not a problem at all. Announcements are in Korean, Japanese, English and Mandarin. Only thing is some stations might not have escalators/ lift so if you are travelling with big luggage, you might want to plan your route properly."
109,5.0,"Seoul has made accessible even the deepest tubes in its subway system. I rode the steepest and longest stairglides I have ever seen the likes of which made me dizzy but got me on my way nonetheless. A plus: the attendants are efficient and friendly with help and directions.My day pass (pictured here) cost me 12,000 and it was suggested to me by the attendant at the counter after I gave up at the automatic dispensers."
110,5.0,Metro system in Seoul is easy to comprehend and vey convenient. Just make sure you get Tmoney card as this will save you time and hassle.
111,5.0,"Very informative, convenient subway. The stops are announced both Korean and English. Infirmation desk is also in Korean and English."
112,4.0,"The Seoul metro system is easy and cheap for getting around the city. Please make sure to get a T-money card from the metro ticket machine at the airport, which you can use for all public transport and taxi. The metro displays and announces in 4 language including Korean, English, Mandarin and Japanese. With clean and wide space coaches train. The only down turn is that you need to adopt to their culture as they don’t express excuse me but pushing people away if the need to pass you."
113,5.0,"I cannot even begin to depict how efficient, cheap, and easy the Seoul Metro is. It may be a bit intimidating at first when you look at a map of how many metro lines there actually are, but don't let that deter you from taking it! And fret not if you don't know Korean, each station is also written and announced in English, so you won't get lost."
114,4.0,"Expansive network, very well signed to know where to go (better than European metro signage).  Tricky if you use a single journey ticket as nothing (map or otherwise) shows you what trips incur a higher cost and you may be trapped before you exit the train as the basic single journey may not be enough.  If you get the T-card, you won't have this problem.  I still used single journey cards since I prefer lots of walking.  But I did figure out that I could buy a single journey card specifying my destination station so up front I would pay the exact fare and avoid being trapped (took only two times before I investigated how to avoid a third..).  Clean cars.  Can get crowded."
115,4.0,"You have to walk a lot when transferring to another line. Trains can be overcrowded. They use also numbers for the station, although I never found a plan where I could find the numberstation."
116,3.0,"This is a really good transportation system. Very efficient.But I need more space to sit, even to stand. Too many people are using this, and it is overcrowded. During rush hours, it is worse. I had to take this every day when I went to Korea for 1 month. I always felt sick. Seriously, too many people. If you are a person who hates overcrowded space very much, I do not recommend you to ride this :( At least, not during the rush hours. By the way, in Korea, people call overcrowded subway ""Hell-way "" lol. The point is transportation awesome, but need more space yes."
117,5.0,The Seoul metro is easy to use and does not cost much. Station names are in Korean and English and they call the stations in both languages. The stations and trains are very clean. Many stations have shops and places of interest.
118,5.0,"Very efficient, easy to use and affordable. The metro is spacious and clean. Easy to understand what lines you need to take."
119,5.0,the seoul metro is a great and the best way around town !! ride costs around 1350 kw which is about 1.20$ . it is divided into numbered lines with different colors. you buy ticket from machines that are in korean and english. they announce the stations in korean and english so it is well organized and easy to use.  the stations are big with many exits .i was very imoressed how immaculately clean the cars and the stations are !
120,5.0,"It's clean, efficient, cheap and covers most of the city. All the maps include station names in English and all station exits are numbered which makes it easy to work out which exit to take. Highly recommend using the subway to get around Seoul and avoid traffic."
121,5.0,On the beginig I didnt really understood why this activity  is the best think to do in Seoul...but after few hours I just loved it. It is extremly well organizated and this jingles....I still listen them even if I am back to Europe
122,4.0,"Very good network and easy usage. Negative : you cannot purchase a smart card in the subway. You must buy one in a convenience store and load it. Otherwise very good and gigantic network. Personally, as a Beijing resident, I prefer the one I use regularly not only because it is much cheaper, as all other prices when comparing Beijing and Seoul but also frequency is much higher.Truth is that it might be easier to get a seat in Seoul rather than in Beijing. Both are very safe and secure."
123,3.0,Directions and instructions are pretty easy to understand. However does not always provide information on how to get to key touristic sites.
124,3.0,"The Seoul Metro is a mix of old and new, Some cars are modern and the others are old. there is no consistency in the signage and it is not easy to understand the direction the train is going."
125,5.0,The Seoul metro is a good way to get between places and its pretty easy. Download the metro app and you will be fine.The metro card can be purchased at the station at vending machine or at the mart at the station. The card cost 3000 won and then you add credit. Mostly it cost 1 dollar between stations.
126,4.0,"I have used this 3 to 4 times when I was in Seoul. It is very well connected, fast and reasonable pricing."
127,5.0,Easy system well connected stations. The wagons are clean and the information is available in English language too.
128,5.0,"Great way to get around in Korea, even for someone with limited to no understanding of the language."
129,5.0,"I used the Seoul Metro extensively during my last visit to this fascinating city. I particularly liked the ease of use, the excellent signposting, cleanliness, extensive route system and the fact that it was easily affordable. I found it easy to navigate and, on most trains the electronic screens gave helpful information on which station was coming up and on which side of the train to alight.One needs to bear in mind that the underground system is very expansive. So going down stairs to the next Metro station invariably means quite a walk before you finally find the track you need. Oh, and if you buy single tickets, do remember to reclaim your 500 Won deposit. For the first couple of days I didn't and I guess the maid in the hotel picked up my ""spent"" tickets in the rubbish bin. If you travel in the evening rush hour expect the journey to be hot. And it's obvious that garlic is a key ingredient in Korean cuisine when you get on a hot, crowded rush hour train. Delightful...Oh, and bear in mind that this is not a 24 hour service. I got caught out after a pub crawl in Itaewon. Trains don't run much past midnight which, therefore, gives you a great opportunity to try out the taxis. But all in all, a really excellent, safe way of getting about here."
130,5.0,"The finest thing that one can say about the Seoul Metro, or any metro system in the entire world, is that it compares favorable to that of the Hong Kong Metro. The Seoul Metro certainly is in that class.I was amazed at the Seoul Metro. It is clean. It is easy to navigate. The metro cars are clean. The riders I encountered were friendly and polite. It seems to cover the greater Seoul area quite well.Bottom Line : The Seoul Metro is as good as it gets."
131,5.0,"I bought an m-pass 7 day ticket for 61,500 won, which was perfect for me as I intended to use the metro so much. I took it to Suwon, Bukhasan national park (Dobongsan stop) and various stops on the airport line for several days. I more than had value from my ticket. The metro system is so large it goes for so many kilometres in all direction from the centre. Stops and interchange stations easy to use and so clean. Highly recommended."
132,5.0,"Best way to get around Seoul, the subway system is super convenient and you can literally go anywhere just by subway. The seats and trains are always clean. A little bit annoying on busy hours though, because it's very crowded. :)The operating hours are 4am-1am on weekdays, and around 6am-midnight on weekends. There are also announcements made in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
133,5.0,"Clean, frequent, cheap and easy to use if you can't read Korean but understand English.Even the ticket machines have an English option"
134,5.0,This is one of the best metro city coverage that I’ve ever seen! Just remember to tap in and tap out when riding
135,5.0,Clean and easy to use. Keep your card so you can get money back when you get to your destination. Around $2 a ride but you get .50 back when you return the card. Ticket machines have an English option.
136,5.0,"Seoul Metro is really fast and good way to go around in the city. Metro tickets are cheap and directions are quite easy to read. However, I suggest to buy T-money card from almost any little convenience store. If you do, you don't have to worry about buying tickets all the time. Also an application with subway map helps you find the fastest way, I use Kakao maps, but there are also other apps."
137,4.0,"The metro in Seoul is excellent and while not as many trains as in Tokyo, there are still plenty that it's not too crowded most of the time. It's quite easy to navigate too, especially with Google Maps."
138,5.0,"The Seoul metro, like many other metro systems I've used is quite efficient. I think the metro system is easy to understand. Once you use it the first time, you get the knack of it and it becomes super easy to navigate. Also the metro map is readily available in visitors' guides and on several posters in the subway."
139,5.0,"Full of overworked children on there way to night school. My experience was official and I know noe the system completely, its always on time. Very clean and safe. WiFi everywhere!"
140,5.0,"The metro is cheap and super easy to use. You can buy a tmoney card from any convenience store. This card can be used on all of the buses, trains, and taxis."
141,5.0,Its great experience to use Seoul Metro and Subway. Its very convenience and clean You may never need taxi in Seoul.
142,5.0,"I have to say South Korea (Seoul in my experience) has one of excellent transportation system in the world. What surprised me is that the train was not as packed as train in Tokyo or Jakarta and had background music to announce train departure, arrival, even when it is on the way. Announcement is made in 4 languages: English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese both on speaker and sign board alongside an arrow pointing at which door would be opened so that passengers could stand before it and disembark. Most of the time it is punctual (which makes it efficient transportation to ride). Also, to make the trip is even more efficient, I would like to recommend an apps named Kakao Metro. Users need to input their destination and place of origin and the apps will lead them to appropriate route. While it is useful to enroute passengers through subway, Kakao Metro is also useful for riding bus. Despite its efficiency and cleanliness, I would like to remind those who bring heavy luggage on board since station buildings tend to have many stairs to climb - some also have elevator and escalators, but still in limited numbers"
143,5.0,"Traffic in Seoul can be time consuming. Metro is by far the fastest way to get from one point to another. Download a map of the metro system so you always got one with you. Every station has numbers so it is easy to find out which way to go. Ticket machines are in all the stations I have been to. 1.450 won for a typical ride. Deposit is 500 won which you get back in another machine when you drop the ticket. Not sure the machines take credit cards. Only saw some for cash. It’s around 1,3 USD per ride."
144,5.0,The train network is comprehensive. It brings you to almost all tourist attractions in Seoul. Plus the frequency of the train is high. The free train map is easy to understand but you may want to bring a magnifying glass if you have difficulties in reading mini micro fonts.
145,5.0,I am a female and traveled solo for a few days in Seoul and taking the metro around the city was quite a breeze. The trains either move very fast or the distance between each stops were very near. Great service from the metro staff too.
146,5.0,"The transportation network in Seoul is one of the best in the world, i used naver map to navigate, it tells me the train direction and what exit i should go to and if there is no train you can go by the bus which is equally as good and it announces stops in english also."
147,5.0,I downloaded the “KakaoMetro” ap and it made travelling by subway simple. You can even set a prompt to let you know when you are arriving at your station. Even though there is a call out on the train in several languages including English - the Korean pronunciation is often quite different to what an English speaking person would expect the name to sound like.Also the subway stations often have several exit gates - the wrong one can put you across or down the street from where you want to be.The trains come every few minutes and cost about 1200 won per trip. Purchase a card at any station and load it. It only took me a couple of days to really get the hang of it and I’m from an older generation - great way to get around.
148,5.0,The Seoul subway is extensive and easy to travel on. Ticket machines have an English menu and the Station names are also in English too. Give it a go!
149,5.0,"They have an extensive train system. This is the way to travel around the city. It is fast, clean, safe and convenient. They have English and Chinese signages so tourists will not get lost."
150,4.0,"There are English signs like station names send directions on each station, it's pretty clear where to navigate. Also there are free toilets on stations and convenient stores.The only problem for me was more stairs less escalators. And the transfer between the lines is not always fast, you have to walk sometimes 5min to change line. Another good thing is that it's practically impossible to fall on the rail since there are protection walls with doors."
151,4.0,"There is so much to see in Seoul, while it’s true that the subway can get you around effectively, it is not the top tourist attraction in a city with so much to offer.If you’re looking for something unusual to do, be sure to visit the mind-blowing Trick Eye Museum.  How about Lotteworld—South Korea’s own Disneyland, but indoors? Not to mention the palaces, especially the Secret Garden at the Changdeokgang Palace.  Then there’s the stunning architecture.That said, if people think the subway is the best thing about visiting Seoul, the buses are the worst.  The drivers are terrible.  If you can’t get a seat, hold on tight because you’ll be lurching all over the place."
152,5.0,"Seoul is a big place, so to think their metro-system would be idiot-proof is just plain silly. Taking the train is cheap, fast and efficient-and the maze of subway exits means that one doesn't need to brave the elements for too long to get to their exact destination. A highly sophisticated and organized system"
153,4.0,the subway links to almost the whole of Seoul.but make sure you know which exit to take as different exits lead to different parts of the area.
154,5.0,The best way to get around Seoul is the metro. It is inexpensive and easy to navigate. Signs are in Korean and English.
155,5.0,"Their metro is indeed very reliable. It's always on time unless something happens. It's not exactly cheap, but the fare is worth it. Almost all of the tourist attractions have a near metro so it's a very convenient mode of transportation for locals and tourists alike."
156,5.0,"There are so many routes that help you to go to your destination in a convenience way. Using T-money card can make your journey easy and convenient. You can easily to understand that where you are since the subway has the English announcement. The subway is clean and neat. It's also easy to transport to the ICN airport. Although the stairs are a lot, it's still overall excellent transportation to tourists.(真的是個很棒的地鐵，裡面很乾淨，也很方便轉乘，適合新手觀光客第一次來訪，不太會迷路，都有中英文標示，)"
157,5.0,"Probably one of the best subways I've used anywhere. It's clean and efficient. It's very affordable and safe. I never felt like I couldn't find my destination, even not speaking Korean. They have everything pretty much translated into English and it was fantastic."
158,5.0,"Highly efficient way to get around Seoul and surprisingly affordable, especially with the available MPass for foreigners.  I was surprised however that no matter location, time of day, day of week, etc. there were never any seats available - always filled.  Plenty of room to stand however, except during commute times. If pregnant no worries, plenty of reserved seating which appears to be strictly respected.  There is a fair amount of senior and disabled seating reserved but these were almost always filled as well. All in all a great way to quickly get around town."
159,5.0,"I was very sure that I could travel alone in Seoul as the country has an excellent transport system. I studied basic Korean, but my Korean is not really up to scratch. However, there's nothing much to worry about because Seoul's transportation system is so accessible that you don't need to know Korean to travel around. The whole city is so well-connected and there's no place that you can't go in Seoul!"
160,5.0,"Here in Seoul for 2 weeks visiting my son.Travelled on the subway each day. All train stations clean,as are trains and toilet facilities. Great way to get around, very reasonable cost.  Other passengers very helpful when I needed directions, many gave me their seat as I use a walking stick. Recommend this Metro to visitors to Seoul."
161,5.0,you can download the submay map app (i recommend 'subway korea' available on app store & google play store) to plan your trip. It will show the fastest route and transfer information with accurate fare.
162,5.0,Best metro in the world. Fast. Easy to get from a to b. Good air conditioning. Not too crowded. Cheap.
163,5.0,"Much like every other metro system the world over, the vast Seoul subway can take some time to master but, fear not, two or three rides in - and paying attention to your map - you should be getting comfortable underground. The city is indeed enormous, so the subway is the most efficient way of exploring, and your feet at the end of a day of sightseeing will thank you. Trains are plentiful, regular and on time, and I can vouch from experience that Seoul’s is one of the safest metros in the world (I’m an experienced traveler on the New York, Hong Kong and London systems). Still, cops are a common sight, and that can only serve to reassure riders. Crucially, you’ll likely get a seat on the train no matter the time of day!"
164,5.0,"Coming from Toronto, this metro system was like a breath of fresh air. It's super clean, spacious and always on time. I can read Korean so the language wasn't an issue for me, but regardless, there is English everywhere so you shouldn't run into any issues. Get yourself a T-card as well (any convenience store will have it), and it will work for taxis, the metro and even at certain supermarkets! Each ride is also so cheap and able to get you anywhere and everywhere. I highly recommend downloading the Kakao Metro app as it will tell you how to get where you need to be, fastest way to get there and even which platform to stand at for optimal convenience. Best metro system EVER!"
165,5.0,Very easy to navigate even if you don't speak any Korean. A great way to save a ton of money on taxis. Buy a t-money or cash-bee card at any convenience store and load a few dollars and you're good to go on any metro or bus in the country. Use Google maps to then figure out which train or bus to take.
166,5.0,"This subway system is far faster, cleaner, and more efficient than the subway systems of either Tokyo, Taipei, or New York.   It is also very clean, and crine is very rare. Public transportation is something Korea does very well!"
167,5.0,"Despite the complaints, Seoul Metro is world class!It is cheap and you can literally go almost everywhere.The cars are well ventilated and clean. Plus, the A/C is good.Just make sure that you avoid rush hours. You can get squished.With ""Hwanseung"" (transfer), things are so efficient and cheap! Unbelievable!A lot of stores have died but there are some still good stores in the subway area.Love the Metro! Hope many countries get effective Metro as Seoul :D"
168,5.0,"Easiest, fastest, and efficients way to move around the Seoul City. More easy if you use T-Money card. Many tourist attraction near the train station. Read the signage & you will be ok. Ride with no worries about traffic jammed & enjoy your visit there <3"
169,3.0,"The good is that the trains are clean, spacious and get you from A to B. There are a number of downsides to the Seoul Metro when I compare it to Tokyo - few stations have air conditioning so it is VERY hot, there is a very long wait between trains which is unlike any other tube system I’ve been on, theres a lack of information boards so it’s hard to see how long it is to the next train, there’s a lot of stairs in stations and the elevators take an age for their door to close and start moving (extra time for disabled people apparently). Single use tickets are plastic cards and you have to pay 500 Won, on top of your ticket price, but you do get the deposit back from the machine just outside the ticket barriers. Interesting cabinets of gas masks are dotted throughout the stations which is interesting 😱!!"
170,5.0,"For tickets, you have to use ticket machines but if you are not sure, ask people around, they will help you. Map is easy to find so if you had no problem in New York or Paris, I am sure you are not in trouble. Moreover, it is safe. Even after 9:00pm, you can take it alone without any problem."
171,5.0,Use a tmoney card for slightly easier travel (you don't need to buy a ticket for each trip).  These can be purchased at convenience stores.  Perhaps ask your hotel to write in Korean  on a piece of paper what you need.
172,5.0,"This system makes transportation in Seoul easy.  Recommendations: 1. Get a T-money card (connivence stores or kiosks around the station). Makes paying for transportation simple (also can be used at convenience stores, taxis and busses)  2. Download a app based Seoul map.  Actually called Seoul or Kakometro.  Just pay attention to the direction of travel of the train and Seoul is at your disposal."
173,5.0,Super easy to use if you pick up a T-Money card from a convenience store. Just reload it and tap every time.
174,5.0,So easy to use and figure out.  All the signs and announcements are in English after Korean.  The ticket machine also has an English option as well.  Trains run frequently all day and the cars are air conditioned.  Never had to walk far to my destination.
175,5.0,you can pretty much get to anywhere with the mix of K-rail and the metro system. there are signs in English
176,5.0,"My experience is very positive. As a first time visitor to Seoul, I had absolutely no problems finding my way around. Everything is well sign-posted and on time."
177,5.0,Seoul’s metro was designed by the French long time ago. The subway begins around 5:30am and ends around midnight depending your destination. The metro does not only travel in Seoul but travels to parts of gyeongdido and incheon. The subway is very clean and organized! Don’t worry about missing your station!! They announce the station in Korean and English! Some stations are announced in Japanese and Chinese too!!
178,4.0,"The second best metro system after Tokyo. The metro can take you to almost anywhere in Seoul. Tips:1. Make sure to get a card and load it with money. You will save time and will be able to take the bus for free (free transfer). If not, you will pay TWICE!2. Try to avoid the rush hour time, it can get really packed. 3. Don't be overwhelmed by the garlic and alcohol smell at times. This is normal in Korea. 4. There are lots of basement restaurant, stores, and fast food outlets. Do try these places.5. Looking for a passport picture? This can be done in the metro too and it is cheap. 6. Keep the metro clean and do not talk loudly.The metro is safe and you will not have a problem. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
179,4.0,"Seoul Metro is one of the best subway systems that I have used.  All signs were in Korean and English.  All the subways lines, stations, and exits are numbered.  I would definitely advise to get a T-Money card that works on both the Metro and bus systems.  The card can also be used in convenient stores.If possible, try to avoid rush hour when the system gets quite crowded.  It would also help if you plan your trip prior to using the system.  Know which direction you want to go by looking at the end terminal station of the metro line.  Most stations have multiple exits.  There are maps in the stations of the local area around each station which I found handy."
180,3.0,a bit confuse of the route esp if i need to have line transfer. don't know which header way of my line. thank god that has apps and i have done it finally.
181,4.0,"The Seoul Metro network is huge, cheap and very efficient. The only thing I didn't like was the signage in some stations that is a bit confusing."
182,5.0,"The title says it all, clean clean and clean!Information everywhere, toilets everywhere and always CLEAN! Very safe as the trains' boarding areas are closed with barriers and boarding doors only open when the train has arrived.Wifi always working even underground.One of the best things of Seoul."
183,5.0,"I always appreciate Seoul Metro. There is no such good transportation anywhere in the world. It is very cheap, clean and comfortable. By metro we go anywhere in Seoul and Gyeonggi very easily and efficiently regardless of heavy traffic like hell and also can transter to public buses. The route is still expanding. How nice to hear that a automatic payment system will be introduced without tagging like highpass. If someone is not familiar with this, one can simply buy a transportation card and install a kind app. Free full 4G Wifi is available everywhere in the subway. On weekends, bicycles can be placed at the end."
184,5.0,"The routes are color coded. Very easy to use. Be sure to ask for an English version of the subway map at the station, by the gates."
185,5.0,Great means to travel around Seoul.  Signage in Korean and English. Inexpensive. Very clean. Very quick.  Stations well distributed through city and close to major attractions.
186,3.0,"I'm no metro noob, having mastered the London underground, the New York Subway, the Moscow Metro, and Mexico City's metro among many others. Seoul's is inferior to all of these for a number of reasons, none of which have to do with language issues. For one thing, the stations are surprisingly FAR from anyplace you want to be. Wherever you're going, expect a good hike once you get out of the closest station. For whatever reason, that is not the case with these other very large cities.Whenever there's an interchange between lines, it is ridiculously far. By far the most massive walks between lines that I've ever encountered anywhere. All that translates to spending a lot of time getting from point A to Point B.Adding to the time factor is the stupid system of paying extra for your single ride ticket only to have to refund the deposit at the other end, leaving you with a bunch of unnecessary coins. Lines that run close to each other don't connect. Some lines run parallel in close proximity. And lines meander in inexplicable directions rather than running logically. I'm sure there's a logic to why they run where they run, but it really doesn't serve the traveler well. On the bright side, it's not that expensive (a little over $1 to ride), clean, air conditioned, not too crowded at most times, and exits are well marked."
187,5.0,"Trains are on time, clean, cheap to travel on and can get you most anywhere you want to go in Seoul."
188,4.0,Easy to travel on. Very clean. Passengers were very nice to us seniors by offering us their seats. WHAT we're NOT old!
189,5.0,"Clean, well organized, connected everywhere in Seoul.But avoid rush hours. Otherwise you would feel like be a hamburger patty."
190,5.0,"While it took me a few minutes to work out the map and ticketing, once I did I found this underground system to be amazingly efficient and also cheap.  The trains were very clean, spacious and regular.  It couldn't be faulted."
191,5.0,One of best subway systems in the world. Easy to understand and use. Directions in English. Can be very busy. Most stop operating by midnight.
192,5.0,"ive so far traveled to 95 countries and yes there are metro systems that are modern and recently constructed but for Seoul to have the sort of oversight to start with a metro framework that works so perfectly and efficiently even after explosive growth over the decades is truly impressive.  i can confidently say this is the best metro system in the world of this scale. most metro systems reach a certain breaking point where all organization is thrown out the window but seoul's system is truly marvelous and is the lifeblood of this fast-paced city.  i have lived in this city for 4 years and the metro with its efficient systems, well-mannered people and constant improving makes this an aspect of the city that needs more appreciation"
193,5.0,"As the title says, it's efficient, safe, inexpensive and the best way to get around the city as a visitor. Very tourist user friendly (English signage, helpful staffers). Easily the best mass transport system I have ever used."
194,5.0,"The metro is well marked in English. You can buy a transportation card, the cost of which is nonrefundable but any extra money you have on it at the end of your trip can be refunded. Or you can just pay for each trip with the new ticket. You pay a deposit for each ticket of 500 but at the end of the trip if you return the ticket you get your 500 back. Each stop has many different exits, so if you are meeting someone at a stop make sure you know the number of the exit. When you get down into the metroThere is a clearly marked line of stops so it is easy for you to figure out which side of the metro you need to get on to get to your destination. The metro is clean and the riders polite. The metro covers a lot of areas and tourist sites are marked in Korean and English."
195,5.0,"Okay it takes time to figure out that the printed cards can only be bought using cash and you get a deposit back but they are cheaper than the multi use card if you are only taking 10 or so trips.after that it's smooth sailing, the trains are fast, clean and come often.A super easy way to get around."
196,5.0,"서울에 어디든 가고 싶다면 지하철응 이용해서 가보세요. 빠르고 저렴하게 움직일 수 있습니다. 상대적으로 저렴한 요금또한 장점입니다.T-money card is ESSENTIAL!!If you want to go wherever in seoul, you can go anywhere by subway. Subway’s fare is KRW 1,300 about USD a dollar 20 cents. It also offers you to transfer to bus with add  transfer fare KRW 50~200 in 30 minutes.                 So if you pay about KRW 30,000 you can enjoy seoul trip with public transportation. If you don’t have wireless service don’t worry about it. Wherever any subway stations and subway cars offer FREE WiFi. Some stations have Convinience stores, stores, bakery stores, small restaurants and cafes. In summer, it operate air-conditioned car and in winter, heater car. Finally, all of subway station operate free restroom/washrooms."
197,5.0,"Great way to quickly travel through Seoul.Subway is clean, fast and on time.T money card system works great."
198,5.0,"It´s very convenient. fast, works all night, you don´t have to wait to long for the next train, aircon is always fresh (you will know what I´m talking about if you visit the city in summer)."
199,5.0,"Extensive network coverage, efficient service and clean trains are the highlight of the metro. It is like the lifeline in Seoul connecting every part of the city with each other. The fares are pretty cheap and the tickets are easy to buy. Highly recommend for a quick transport."
200,5.0,"One of the joys of Seoul is its subway system. It's almost always on time, clean, wide, and phone/internet network works throughout. Download one of the apps to plan your journey: the best exit/nearest door to interchange is also indicated."
201,5.0,"First visit to Seoul and I used the metro an awful lot! So convenient, clean and never overly crowded. Easy to navigate after a very short time. Very fairly priced. Every country needs a subway system like this!"
202,4.0,"Payment are easy by using T-money card, and there's also mobile app. available to get information about which train/line to take to go to any station, price information, and timetable.It's relatively cheap, clean, and fast.The only downside is the availability of elevators in the stations. It's difficult especially when you're carrying heavy luggage."
203,5.0,"Seoul metro is enormous in size, and may be extremely confusing. You can spend more than two hours traveling between two destinations. Line #1 itself is the longest in the world, about 200km in length! Some lines have express trains, which won't stop at some stations, to speed up transportation. It is truly a marvel of transportation engineering."
204,5.0,"Seoul’s metro works amazingly and will take you anywhere without any problem BUT please please please use the apps that help you navigate, the stations and the amount of people might make you get lost!"
205,5.0,"Honestly, it’s really just amazing how clean and efficient this system is. I’m from NYC so this was the cleanest thing I had ever seen. The trains are so fast and on time, and I don’t recall ever seeing trash around. Like any city that isn’t NYC, the trains don’t run 24/7 but the quality is still superior. All the signs are also in English and the maps are actually quite thorough and obvious, even if English isn’t that easy for you. The maps inside the trains even tell you what side the doors open on at each stop! AMAZINGLY CONVENIENT. The fares run by distance, so you tap in and out of the stations, but it’s still really affordable. The metro card also works in Busan, and I think some other cities as well. Busan metro was also excellent. I don’t recall if I saw the woman-only train carts in Seoul, but I definitely saw them in Busan (woman only during a specific time of the night, for their safety). At one point I did have an issue tapping out of a train station but there’s a call service button at the end of the turnstiles, and after hitting it and explaining through the intercom that I did not speak Korean and was very confused, they just beeped me through. I never saw the worker, but I guess all is well that ends well. The machines you use to add money to the metro cards also work in english so fear not. And even if you do get confused you’re bound to be approached by a station worker or passerby to offer assistance. There’s also a subway app (Subway Korea) that you can use to plan routes and fares with real-time directions and timetables (it also works for Busan and some other cities)."
206,5.0,"What to say? efficient, clean, fast, friendly staff....great way to get around the city at a good price."
207,4.0,"Seoul Metro is a great way to get around the city, once you get used to it. Buy a travel pass at Inchon airport which will give you the best deal. If you don’t do this, the next option is to buy a pass in the metro for 3,000 KRW and then load it with your travel funds. I started with 10,000 KRW and then toppled it up as necessary. The tickets can be used on the metro or the bus service, although the metro is much quicker. Get a free metro map from your hotel or the station itself. The metro does take a little getting used to and can sometimes be a little confusing. Once you have identified the station of the line you need, then it’s a simple case of following the route and the connections.  The confusing part is that the direction you need to head in is often posted as the next station on the line. When you think you are at the right line and junction, double check above the train doors that the next stop is the one that is heading in the direction you need. Once you get the hang of it, it’s a breeze."
208,5.0,"The subway system is easy to use. Even though I cannot read Hanji, I could understand the subway stations on the bus routes to figure out the connections via Google Maps. The subways & buses have Korean & English announcements before each stop."
209,4.0,clean and easy to use..there's a person who will assist behind you if you don't know how will you get the ticket going to an specific place...from airport going to the nearest underground mall shopping will take more than an hour...but it's really nice choice to travel..its really convinient..if you're just in korea for a couple of hours layover...u better stay at the airport only or take the bus tour that will take you nearby the airport..because it takes more than an hour to go to the city ..but all is so beautiful..specially shopping in korea ..and the food is so great...
210,4.0,"Very good subway system, one of the best I experienced in the whole world. The stations are very clean and the trains are always on time."
211,4.0,You need a subway map. I got confused a lot . There are so many lines and a lot of stations have similar names. At least there are names in English letters.
212,5.0,"The metro was moving fast, people were organized nicely, there was even English guidelines to help you with travelOn top of all every time you were lost you can ask someone and get help. Third best metro system I have been after Shanghai and London."
213,5.0,The metro is so easy and cheap. It can see overwhelming at first but I highly recommend taking a second to figure it out. I was travelling solo and don't speak a lick of Korean and am glad I took advantage of this. About 1.50 Canadian each use.
214,5.0,"What a way to travel and see all of Seoul. Extremely cheap, super simple and beyond clean! Make sure to but a T-money card and fill it with cash so that you never have to dig in your wallets. Just pop the T-money card on the top of the entry path and that is it. Quick and good to go. I used the app Subway Korea for a map and timetable of all trains.Being the respect level in Korea is set to a high standard, I find that there is proper edict on the subways as well. People are very quite, mind their own business and also give their seats to any disabled or elder people that comes on....which is wonderful ! Make sure that you do your research as to exactly where you need to go before getting on. What I mean by that is there are subway train exits that you get off train but then there is at least another 10 street exits listed by numbers and you will need to know which one to take to get you back up onto the street level. That part was a bit tricky so spend the extra time to research first.There are NO trash cans anywhere in the subway. So if you bring down water bottles or any other trash, you will have to hold on to it until you are completely out of subway.Also remember that the subway closes at midnight. Take that into consideration if you are out for a night of partying. Then you will either need a cab or bus to get back to hotel."
215,5.0,"I live in Seoul for 4 years. My advice: if you want to experience Seoul subway, it is better to avoid first line:) the metro system is very hi-tech and developed absolutely well!"
216,4.0,Traveled in metro in many cities and I am impressed with Seoul metro. Maps and directions and signs are very clear and easy to use.
217,5.0,Seoul Metro is great. The price is good. The stations are very clean. The trains are clean and usually on time. Most of the trains come very frequently. The map is easy to read and is in Korean and English. The station announcements are in Korean and English.
218,5.0,"Considered one of the best in the world. Clean, friendly, easy to navigate. Consider downloading the ""Seoul Metro"" app for your trip so you can have access to all the subway lines and stops. I had no troubles using the metro to travel across all areas of the city. Plenty of shopping, food, and ATMs available as well."
219,5.0,"What more do you want from an urban subway system? Signs in Korean and English, announcements on the train in both languages, a clean environment, plenty of space. Great way to get around the city."
220,5.0,The subway is the cheapest and fastest way to get to everywhere in Seoul. Available a rechargeable card called Tmoney.
221,5.0,"I am a foreigner who speaks no Korean, but getting around the subway was easy and fun.  The price is really reasonable.  If I was ever confused you can always ask Koreans around you, the people are helpful and kind and always ready to help.  Even if they don't speak your language, they will try and help you out.When making connections between lines in a subway station you may have to walk a little bit...and up stairs and such...so it's not the easiest for people with disabilities."
222,4.0,reasonable fares to explore the City and nearby places with some shopping stores and food shops in almost every stations
223,3.0,This is one of the best places to people watch. Three days ago I watched an African dude puke on a lady. It turned my ok day into the best day.
224,4.0,"I had the T-money card, it can be topped up at convenience stores like 7-11. I always travel by Seoul Metro."
225,5.0,Goes to many places and is open late. i used it to get everywhere in Seoul and even outside of Seoul.
226,5.0,You can go anywhere is seoul with the subway. Just take an good english app that will help you. There is one that id called suvway seoul with a yellow background with a subway on it as picture. Very easy app ! If you use kakaomaps you can get around easily too. And kakaomaps is so easy to find buses too ^^
227,5.0,"Ok, this clearly isn't an attraction, but here's some tips for using this form of public transit. 1. There's a few apps for using it. ""Subway Korea"" was my favorite one for using in English. 2. The apps can even tell you which train car and door to go to for the fastest transfer. Sidenote: those transfer times are usually when someone is casually walking. You can cut a 3 minute transfer down to 1 if you're running for dear life. 3. Don't forget to tap out when you leave the subway or bus. If you forget, they can double charge your next trip when you tap in."
228,3.0,"It's decently priced (about $1.50 Canadian per ride) but you need to give a 500KRW deposit every time you buy a ticket then you return the ticket to get the deposit back. It's obvious this is a small but likely effective money-making scheme, and it bugs me. Trains take longer than most places, they were clean but the stations are quite confusing and don[t have the best signage (very little in English as well)."
229,5.0,"Used Seoul and Inchon metro subway a number of times while travelling in Korea for a week.   It is incredibly clean, efficient and  comfortable ways to go from A to B.     Understandably it does get packed during morning and afternoon rush hour but outside of these two busy times, it is super comfy!"
230,5.0,"I took the system from the Incheon area into Seoul to The War Museum Of Korea. The system is very busy so it has trains running on multiple levels and the transfer station was huge. I was able to find my way to the proper level and track without much trouble at all. The system is very efficient, clean and fast."
231,4.0,"It's clean, comfortable and fast. Better then bus cuz it has no traffic. I just wish people would be a little nicer to elders."
232,4.0,"I only speak English, so it was a LITTLE bit difficult, but once I got the hang of it, no major issues. Key: know what the NEXT stop is in the direction you want to go, then it's easier to know which side of the track you need to be on and MAJOR stops on the way (ie Seoul Station and if you want to go towards or away from it). Definitely get a T Money card, even if you go for just a day, saves time and money and you can use it everywhere like 7-11 and GS25. Stations and trains are clean and signs to major attractions are a major help."
233,5.0,It was one of the most  comfortable  and modern  metro that I used in  Asia and I hope UK/ London  transport  can learn from them.
234,4.0,"trains stations makes life easier when u are roaming around s korea. toilets are clean, elevator and escalator are available but not all transfers and station have it."
235,3.0,"After travelling in subways in China, Taiwan & Hongkong this year I didnt bother downloading the subway map on my phone of bother to study before arriving. Maybe I should of.. because if I didnt have google on my phone maybe I would of struggled! I seen quite alot of foreigners looking puzzled here lol I have got lost but have had to use my brain cells more this week 😂😂"
236,5.0,"My son showed me how to load up a subway pass and it seemed to last for more than a week on 30$ US  (30,000 Won)"
237,5.0,This is a great way to zip around Seoul. Ticket machines have an English button if needed. I brought the pass from the Airport topped it up and away I went. Don't worry about putting to much coin on the card as you can get a refund back at the airport.
238,3.0,Lack of information counter at the station and the staff cant really understand English. A bit confusing when need to top up the T money and refund. There is no information when is the next train coming. Perhaps the train line legend should be visible on the wall and not at certain pillars which need to hunt down which pillar has the train line. No heater in the station. it was very cold waiting for the train during winter. No lift avalable and a challenge when carry big luggage down the endless steps. Overall station is clean
239,4.0,"The metro system here is not that complex. Easily to transport. The stations, mostly, are clean and have a lot of space."
240,3.0,"It is very good amd it gets you everywhere you need to go. As a foreigner it can be dounting. Many if not all is in Korean or English but if you are not familiar with the language many names seem to sound the same. Take care of noting the difference between ""K"" and ""G"". People who take the subway have always been very helpful to me. Many commuters speak some level of English and want to help you. Some will even go as far as to accompany you to your destination."
241,5.0,"Seoul metro is very fast and most lines have clean trains. Just avoid commuting hours, especially in the evening between 6-8, when it is often jam-packed. Line 6 and 7 are relatively less crowed, probably they run east-west and not stop at the most popular places."
242,4.0,"Seoul metro is not as complicated as some other countries. The metro has many exit or entrances which would lead to difference places. These are the exits you want to look out for to ensure you don't have to walk a long distance to your destination. In most websites of shopping malls or attractions and some eatries, they will indicate which is the nearest exit.The metro can be crowded at times and those travellers with back pack may find it difficult to find a comfortable spot to stand without getting into everyone's way. One thing I notice is that the space for elderly seats or space for wheelchair users often allow you some standing space. If you do not see any wheel chair users in sight during boarding, you might want to chose that cabin. You will find that you have some space to stand. But do not sit on the seats for elderly as it is reserved for them. One of the best website I found is known as Subway Korea, it indicates real time travel and is easy to use. The map is in English. The metro trains have english announcement as well as an electrical board that flashes the stop the train is arriving at. Travelling by metro is convenient and efficient."
243,5.0,"Probably the most efficient and easiest way to roam the big city (and nearby sights).The Seoul subway system is constantly extended and quite easy to find your way. Announcements and signs are usually done in 3 languages ( Korean, English and Chinese) at least whilst you sometimes find even signs in Japanese. Connections are well sign posted and easy to find. A lot of stations are underground shopping malls and it's interesting to spend done underground, especially during the rainy summer days. In comparison to many other major cities, the Seoul subway is quite inexpensive. Easiest to purchase a Tmoney card or cash bee, load it with money on one of the machines at any station( manual in many languages) and then easily cheek in and out.  These pre loaded cards offer an even cheaper rate compared to single fare tickets. In addition when you transfer to busses the fare is smaller with the Tmoney card, rather than buying a new ticket for the bus. During rush hours some lines(actually most) are very packed. maybe not like the famous pics you know from Tokyo, but similar. It's an advantage to be tall and not too be claustrophobic! All other times it's ok. You beat the traffic and arrive on time. The entire system offers LTE network and mostly even free WLAN.enjoy your ride!"
244,5.0,"There are elevators or escalators at any stations, so don’t worry about your heavy luggage. Have a nice trip :)"
245,5.0,"You can go to anyway by using their subway. You basically need to walk more since most of the exits are far aparts from where you stop. Anyway, it’s a good exercise for your body! 😘😛"
246,5.0,"Great subway system in the city. It connects nearly everywhere and far out. T Money cards are really great here, you can pay for so many types of transportation with them. And you can reload them nearly anywhere. They have everything in English too so you can understand it. Apps on your phone to be able to understand it too."
247,5.0,"As a military member stationed in Korea, I have utilized the Seoul Metro numerous times.  I lived near Osan Air Base and could take the Metro up to Seoul in about 2 hours from Songtan Station for only 3-4,000 won each way.  Best to get a rechargeable card from a local convenient store and swipe when you enter and exit the stations.  Cards are also good for buses.  There are handy maps available and stops are announced in Korean/Hangul and English.  There is a handy app for smart phones that lets you track the trains and estimate times between stations.  Great way to travel as the roads can be very congested especially in Seoul.  Ride the Metro and enjoy the culture!!"
248,5.0,Great network and once you master the transfer between lines then a simple way to get to most key places.Tmoney cars makes it all so simple to tap on and tap off.The key was finding a great App which let me pick FROM and TO and gave all the key information about the number of stations and where to transfer as well as which side of the train to exit.Each carriage had lots of maps of the line and network to work out exactly where you are and going. Am sure many Apps will add this functionality and others so won't promote any one in particular.Also worth finding an app that lets your NFC reader check your Tmoney card balance. Announcements in multiple languages including English.
249,4.0,One of the best metro services I have come across. Really. Ice connection to all parts of city including airports. Do not enter with your coffee or bread in the train ... enjoy the music while riding to your destination. It is also really inexpensive
250,5.0,Thoroughly impressed with Seoul’s metro. Visited the city for 9 days in Dec2017 and not once did the train breakdown. Highly reliable and efficient.  The directions and signages were also clear (comprising 4 different languages) and easy to navigate. A very convenient way of getting around.
251,5.0,"Easy to use, clean and efficient. Make sure you know where you are going before getting the ticket. The machine is easy to use. At the end you can return your subway card and get the deposit back."
252,5.0,"I printed the subway map on A3 paper when I was still at home and it made my life easier  as I did not see the maps around the train stations neither at the airport nor in the city. But maybe I did not know where to look.Announcements of coming stations, transfer lines and on which side is the exit are in 4 languages including English (again this helps). Also there are maps of subway lines above the doors inside carriages. In some trains these maps are with lights showing how the train progresses between the stations.If you need to change lines it is better to examine the map beforehand so that you know several main stations in the direction you need to go. Sometimes it is not straightforward which platform you need to go to on the line you are changing. Majority of people do not speak English so you need to be prepared to figure things out on your own.Trains waiting time is about 5 minutes."
253,4.0,"This subway system is  one of the biggest in the world. It is a little bit hard to read the small maps and some of them are in corean. But in general if you have the subway app and a little additional map with English subtitles you won't get lost, but be careful and always check which line do you need."
254,5.0,"The map is very clear and easy to understand, but if you tend to carry big heavy bags then transfering between lines will be a problem since you will have to go a long way to get to another line"
255,5.0,"The best way to get through the sybway is Kakao app. It will save lots of time and trouble.  Subs are clean, on time and easy to ride."
256,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around the big city! It could take you as far as Incheon and Suwon. It was clean and easy to access. However, if you are a PWD or elderly, you might have a little difficulty in navigating some of the stations because sometimes there are no lifts or escalators."
257,5.0,Very convenient using Seoul Metro to go around. This transportation cover almost all tourism area in Seoul
258,3.0,"I have been using many metros around the world and the Seul Metro was the most difficult to use. I used Google maps but they don’t have the accurate information to move around with. So, to use it, go to the station with google maps, a paper map of the Seul Metro Stations and plenty of time. Stations and trains are nice, new and clean."
259,5.0,"The Seoul metro is incredibly easy to navigate, inexpensive, and clean. There is so much to explore in this amazing city and the metro can be part of the adventure. Dual language maps are located all over the stations and in the trains, the stops are announced and clearly displayed, and navigation through the transfer stations is well marked. The stations/stops often have interesting small shops to explore and you can even find some delicious treats!  Pay close attention to the exit you choose as you can end up turned around when resurfacing.  Even for novice travelers the Seoul metro is a great way to get around a large city."
260,5.0,Pretty standard and straightforward metro system to use. Relatively cheap. Really liked the idea of recycling the used ticket to get the deposit refund. Definitely reduces the carbon footprint by recycling paper.
261,5.0,"very efficient railway system!!!! one of the best and comprehensively covers entire Seoul!!! the minimum fare is quite higher though if you compute it at fare per station, going to a nearby station would come out costly so better study a map and take a walk!"
262,5.0,The Seoul metro is a cheap and efficient way of going around Seoul especially for a solo traveler like me. Most major tourist destinations have a metro/subway station near them so its very convenient going around from one place to another.
263,5.0,Staff is usually very friendly and would even walk you to your train in case you're completely lost.The ticket machines also work in English.
264,4.0,"The metro works fine as long as you know your way. I find the system of single tickets quite a waste of time, would like a system like the Suica in Tokyo available for visitors.One thing is, due to the layout of the lines which is a system of winding lines it’s not always easy to find a straight route between A and B and trips can be quite long if you have a transfer or more. For instance it takes 1.5 hours from Gangnam to Anguk. And it costs 1.5 USD, which is fine.Can be crowded at peak times of course but otherwise the trips are OK in terms of comfort."

270,5.0,"I can't imagine a better transportation system in our age than Seoul metro!It's cheap and it's fun and very efficient.Cons:It is getting closed at midnight, so the only time I had to use Taxi in Seoul was when I stayed late in my friend home.Also, the T-card can be recharged only with cash, so you have to bring enough cash with you and not depend on cc."

273,5.0,Its a HUGE subway system and the station names are a mouthful but subways are same same around the world. Go on be game! It'll save you time and your feet
274,5.0,Seoul metro has 11lines with connection of satelite cities. Also metro provide one pass connected with public bus. Once you buy public transportation card you can use it for metro and bus. This card is very convenient because you just put the card on payment pannel in metro or bus. Please enjoy it.
275,4.0,"The Seoul train systems consists of train and metro. The routes are planned logically and connected to each other well. I believe the design was originallt from Japan as it is very similar to Tokyo system. The vending machine for tickets is good where you find multiple languages including English and Chinese. You pick youe destination and number of tickets and the machine will calculate the total cost. One time ticket gas a 500won deposit and you can get refund from a different machine at each exit. All most all stations have three level structure where the first floor is gound floor entrance and there are escalators to B1. At B1, it is the train station entrance where you check the map, plan your trip and buy tickets. Once you enter the station, you go to B2 to take the train. There are names and directions on the glass panel. The train will annouce stations for each stop, mostly in Korean and English. Once you are off the train, you either go one level up for exit or go to the connected corridor for transit except for some large stations where you need to go up and transit and go down again for anothet train. I lost a few times when I have difficulties finding the right exit or the ticket does not work if the exit is wrong. I eventually figure it out how it is set up and Never get lost. Large stations with multiple line transit could be confusing when you are first there and see Korean only."
276,5.0,"We traveled everywhere in Seoul via the metro.  It is efficient and smooth.  We downloaded the app that is very accurate, tells you exactly when the metro is coming and what doors to enter through to make your next connection the most efficient.  It is one of the best public transport systems I've ever used.  Get the TMoney card at the airport, it is worth not having to waste time buying separate tickets and it is easy to load."
277,5.0,"I'm generally a bad navigator, however, with the help of Google Maps, it advises you which bus to take & which stop to get off to reach your next destination."
278,4.0,You can travel anywhere with Metro. The announcements are available in English also. Clear Maps are available. A good alternative to taxis.
279,4.0,"very well organized some line have announcements in double languages only, Others have english written names of stations"
280,3.0,"Parts of the metro aren't all that new and although it's all very efficient and can whizz you around to all the city corners, it's not so easy on the feet. There are a LOT of stairs in every station and escalators and elevators are a rarity. The metro is not for anyone with mobility challenges. Buy a pass (although you have to pay for the card itself) as it will save time and cash."
281,5.0,"Complicated as it looks on the map but it's not. Very comfortable, clean and not crowded train! You can access almost the whole Seoul and nearby cities in this reliable metro. Most of lines close at around midnight but better you check it out as it depends on which station are you. Seoul metro is one of the best in the world."
282,5.0,"Seoul Metro is an easy way to get around the city. The subway lines are numbered and colour coded, which is helpful for finding your destination and also, if you have to transfer lines.The trains make announcements in Korean, English, Chinese and sometimes Japanese. The KakaoMetro app is the best to use if you want to plan and navigate your journey, it tells you exactly where you need to go, even down to the carriage that it closest to exits for transferring. I strongly suggest purchasing a T-Money card from any of the convenience stores that are located all around Seoul. Do not rely on single issue tickets, it's not effective and should only be used in emergencies.Travel costs from one station to another is around 1,250 won, which is one of the cheapest modes of transport in Seoul. Trains are frequent every 5-10 minutes, depending on time and day of the week. They're also clean and fast, which is what is expected for such a large city. It really is the best way to navigate around Seoul, as buses can be slow due to traffic."
283,5.0,I've used a lot of metro and this is one of the best. Very convenient. Many many lines and great interconnectivity.  Usually can get seats unless it's rush hour.  Very clean and quiet. Lots of announcements and electric signs.  Many exits with english points of interest at each sign.Price is ok.  Usually 1250 KRW but occasionally more. Buy a T Card from a 7/11 or station vending machine.  Honestly it made my cuty experience much better
284,5.0,Quick and efficient. And I like the idea of recycling. You return your ticket you get quarter of it back
285,5.0,"Very well designed. Possible to find metro map, travel and station information everywhere in metro and train, in English. Possible to understand which exit to use. All is mentioned clearly. Fast and easy means of transportation in Seoul city."
286,5.0,I love Seoul Metro.They get you everywhere you need to go and they're so clean and efficient. And I'm willing to bet they're one of the most accessible metros in the world. I wish London's metro was as wheelchair accessible as Seoul's is.
287,4.0,The metro in Seoul is one of the best that I have ever been on. It is so easy to use and navigate and is very English friendly. I had translations with me and never had to use them once because I could read all the signage. The exits always seemed to be close to where I wanted to go so I never had to walk very far once exiting the stations either. I would highly recommend getting a T-money card and taking the subway to get around Seoul for both locals and tourists.
288,4.0,"Very easy to navigate. It definitely takes a fee turns to make it easy, but I believe that was all from the language barrier."
289,5.0,"One of the best transportation mode in hustling & bustling streets of Seoul. Easy to use and has connection to almost entire city and sometimes out of city as well. Do buy a metro card (T Money with CVS4U), recharge and vroooom... Just travel and enjoy. Taxi is expensive and traffic is sometimes nauseating so Metro is the best way to move around the city hassle free. Has connections to Public buses as well. Closes at around 11:55 PM.Cheers,BokaBoy"
290,5.0,"There are many subway lines in Seoul, which makes complicate to visitors.It is economical to move on Metro from one place to another because you don't need to pay too much money, only pay excess fee less than 20% or no without howmany times you trasfer Metros at one time. It is convinient to get in or off because there will be announcement or any sign in the monitor where you are. And you can enjoy free wifi in Metro all the times. But you have to walk a little to get Metro or transfer another line and it will be crowded at commute time."
291,5.0,"Fast, clean, and usually punctual, Seoul's subway system is one of the best in the world. They do end service fairly early considering how late many Koreans stay out at night."
292,5.0,"Very easy to understand. It takes from point A to Z without any conflicts. Subways and buses do a great work.together. They are reliable and very easy to use. Buy a T-money card, you can reload them anytime and they are accepted in any subway and bus station."
293,5.0,"Very busy but easy to navigateBuy a Suca card which you purchase outside stationSome other travellers advised it can be brought online before leaving homeLoad money on then you can use on trains, vending machines and taxisTrains run very regularly and very safeHardest part finding exit as large shopping complexes underground"
