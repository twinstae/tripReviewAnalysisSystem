0,5.0,This traditional market is the best way to know more about the local food culture. The aroma of the korean delicacies surrounds the area where most of the food vendors were concentrated and you will be spoilt for choice at the market. We feel like a local when we sit in front of the stall to try the famous mungbean pancake which is freshly made on the spot and it taste not too bad. There are also shops that sells korean snack and souvenirs that are cheaper than the ones sold at myeongdong shopping street.
1,5.0,Loved the market as they are primarily run by local Koreans. Definitely recommend to eat at the makeshift stores like a local - the seats are heated and many sell local dumpling noodles which make it so satisfying to have during the winter. This is also the place where you can visit the store which appeared on Netflix‚Äôs ‚Äústreet food‚Äù. Recommend to have the mung bean pancake and beef tartare.Should definitely visit this place as it is near to Dongdaemun as well so you can always head there after this market
2,5.0,"Great place to have lunch. If you want to try transitional cuisine, that‚Äôs the place. There are plenty options in a super affordable price. Loved it, specially the dumplings!!!!"
3,3.0,"I love this place because there are a lot of Korean food here. I ate bibimbap and teokbokki, but the taste was not really good. Somehow I still love the place because you can feel the traditional of Korea and how the local interact with each other."
4,5.0,This market isn‚Äôt as busy as Namdaemun market but is fully enclosed. The stalls are pretty repetitive but variety of food is still good nonetheless.
5,3.0,"As food markets or night markets go, this one is no more than average.  It is part of a larger produce, fish, chicken and meat (and some clothing) market.Its obvious advantage is that it is covered and so a reasonable destination even in inclement weather.  It also has two clear disadvantages: 1- the variety of food served is very limited.  You have stall after stall serving the exact same thing.  2- the aisles are narrow.  We were there late afternoon on a weekday, and there were spots where passage was difficult.  I wonder whether passage becomes more difficult in the evening or on weekends."
6,4.0,"One of our stops on the night tour was the Gwangjang Market where some of my family members were brave enough to try eating live octopus. I was not even brave enough to sit at the same table with them. I did try their famous pancakes from one of their vegetarian stalls and was mildly impressed. The best find for me in this market was their donuts. The line was long but moved fast. They could not make them fast enough. My family went back for seconds. If you are ever in this market go for the freshly made donuts (its soaped long instead of round), the taste is worth every calorie. You can watch it being made as well. Priced moderately."
7,5.0,"Fantastic market with heaps of small street food stalls. Pretty big area covering the block, heaps of stalls to walk around and can sit down to each at eat. Heaps of variety, catering for truly Korean food. Very tasty and fresh."
8,5.0,"What a colourful and sense evoking experience with so many things to eat, smell, see and be a part of! A fabulous market. The kimchi dumplings and mung bean pancakes were amazing! Some good options if you are vegetarian."
9,5.0,Tried all the 3 shops that were featured on Netflix. Loved the experience. Netflix 1 Dimsums @ 5000 KRW were delicious2: The raw crab in soya (very expensive 20000 KRW) for a small crab.3. Pan cake (average - nothing special) the experience and the atmosphere is super.
10,5.0,"I went there with my korean friend and we tried raw beef dish and korean pancake, which is the popular dish of Gwangjang market. Both were delicious especially korean pancake. I loved it really. It is worth to mention that the vibe and atmosphere there was amazing. It was a bit crowded but that what you should expect to be in local market. There are many things for you to try there, so it is better to go with friends so you can try more dishes."
11,4.0,It's like a food market where you can buy street food and walk along the street to find more food. Nothing special unless there is a specific food stall that you want here.
12,4.0,"I was brought by my friend to see this local market. There are a lot of food stores, selling a variety of products. In the east side of the market, there are a lot of food vendors selling mungbean pancakes to cold noodles. On the second floor (or first floor if you are British/European), there are vendors selling traditional Korean wedding dresses (similar to Hanbok) and also second hand clothing."
13,4.0,"5 sectors in this market: 1) food 2) clothing 3) Daily necessities 4) dried food and titbits n fruits 5) wet markets for seafood.  Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons.   The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings.  You should bargain, but not too much.  Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds.  There is also another alley like wet market, selling seafood and dried fishes."
14,4.0,"The food section of the market was still buzzing at 7 pm on a Friday, other sections were mainly shutting down or closed. We stuffed down hand pulled noodles by the Netflix celebrity, washed down with rice beer, gimbap, tteokbokki and live baby octupus. Would definitely visit again and allot more time for discovery."
15,2.0,There are a lot of Korean local food and I'm not surprised that they are not that hygienic. The market itself is too crowded and I don't feel comfortable with it.
16,3.0,"The food here was great, I had the mung bean pancake. Apart from the food, this place is super crowded and the shops are pretty much the same shops you see all over the city."
17,4.0,The market is full of snacks and other items that can be great souvenirs. It also has things for the home if your living in Korea. The best thing about it is its delicious traditional Korean food. Definitely try the knife cut noodles and mandu. The mung bean pancake is good too. It tastes like a thick hashbrown. I would definitely recommend this place in the spring or fall
18,5.0,"When we visited, my husband and I were looking to buy hanboks. We entered a building where they were selling hanboks and the first stall didn't have the style I wanted. But she motioned for us to follow her. She left her stall and ran (with all 7 of us following her) to another shop just to help me find the hanbok I wanted. We ended up purchasing from the shop she took us to, then we went back to purchase my husband's hanbok from her shop."
19,3.0,This place sells all kinds of korean local traditional food. Tourists and locals frequent this place.
20,5.0,"Gwangjang market was our go to brunch destination. They offer things from spices to fresh seafood, pickled food to textiles. But let‚Äôs be honest, my only reason for going there is to eat. So many rows of food stalls and so many things to choose from. We had to come back twice to sample all the food we wanted. I love the meat/mung bean pancakes, the kalguksu with mandu. You can also get the live octopus (sannakji) here. Oh and don‚Äôt forget to try the hotteok (honey pancake)üëå.Get off at Jongno 5-ga station or Euljiro 4-ga stationHappy eating!"
21,1.0,"Gwangjang Market is very busy and now it seems the owners have learned to take advantage of this.I went into an accessory shop to buy my niece a few things for her first birthday. The ahjumma quoted me a price of 46,000‚Ç©. While she went to the back to get a plastic bag for me, I placed a 50,000‚Ç© note on the counter. I turned to look at a few more items while she was packing my things. My back was turned away from her, and she tells me I gave her 5,000‚Ç© instead of 50,000‚Ç©.üò≤I know for certain I had two 50,000‚Ç© notes with me because I had just gone to the ATM and withdrew them.I asked her if she had CCTV in her store...and of course, she didn't. Her ""friend"" another ahjumma store owner (conveniently) walked up and said she was watching the entire time and a money switch was not possible.The whole situation was sketchy and it seems like these ladies do this as often as possible.I suppose I could have called the police, but without CCTV, I felt I really didn't have a choice but to leave....without my 45,000‚Ç©.So....shoppers beware. NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU'VE LIVED IN KOREA and even though you believe Korean people don't steal....never, ever, ever....leave your money on a counter. In my 10 years here, I never thought this could happen....glad my lesson only cost me $45.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
22,5.0,It‚Äôs crazy in a positive way by walking through the food market on weekends. The live cooking looks so amazing and the food is so fabulous!
23,4.0,"This place is accessible and offers several Korean food at affordable prices. The aunties are nice too. The market also sells other things than food, but I believe most tourist go for the food."
24,5.0,"We went on a tour with a local guide and found the market to be lively on a Sunday night. There was plenty of food and drink to choose from. I recommend anything fried & try something you might not have eaten on a regular day - mine was a kimchi mini crab! You can sit on the heated seats and enjoy the company of other travelers or take your food to-go. The smells will remind you that you are in old school Korea, and probably that you're hungry! Plan to spend at least two hours here eating and touring the shops. Take cash as it's easier and quicker to pay in won."
25,4.0,"Whether you like Korean food esp Korean street food or not, you will still enjoy this place. I recommend weekdays than weekend esp Sunday.  some places closed on Sunday yet still lots to see and try.... be aware of crowds on Sundays, the market has very narrow street due to heaps of stalls there. hustle and bustle for sure and heaps of street food and traditional Korean rice wine as well."
26,4.0,"I like this place! You can try many local foods here with affordable price. My recommendation is Dakbal (boneless chicken feet) it‚Äôs VERY delicious! Ah, and a little bit spicy but not too much üòä"
27,4.0,Gwangjang Market near to Ihwa Mural Village. Lots of local foods here and the taste is quite good. I bought kimchi from here because the ajumma let us try n the taste is good.
28,4.0,"Great experience for tourists visiting Korea. Various food stalls located in the middle of the market, do try them, the food there is generally tasty as well."
29,4.0,"This gwangjang market was inly 8minutes walk from novotel ambassador seoul dongdaemun , and offer so many variant of korean food , love it !!! And the price is even cheaper and open until midnight.Beside food, also selling so many things, something for house and all, great to explore korea in this way"
30,3.0,"Just another local market selling all kinds of stuff. Clothes, textile and local food. You see tourist and locals hanging around here."
31,5.0,"If you are in Seoul, this is the place you must visit! Such a variety of food is available for your tastebud! Pa-jeon, Nok-du-jeon, bin-dae-ddeok, ma-yak-gim-bap, etc.Oh, and inner side of the market offers many stores that offer beautiful traditional korean clothes for you to wear at very billiger price! Try them!"
32,4.0,Eat eat eat!  All kind of banchan ( Korean side dishes) ! First time trying  out  raw marinaded crabs. The taste is very flavourful! Must eat with rice !
33,4.0,"After visiting Insadong, my friend and I went to Gwanjang Market. It has many things to offer but what I like the best is the variety of ü•ò  üêô üê† üêü üå∂ to try. I enjoyed trying different street foods especially the octopus marinated in chili üå∂ (I forgot the name) I will go back to enjoy their food again. It was late when I saw the bedsheets and different comforters. I think the prices of cloth and bedsheets are cheaper there than in other markets I visited. I need to bring larger suitcases next time so that I can buy things I want in that market."
34,4.0,"As you can imagine, at the food street this is extremely touristy; however it‚Äôs a great one pit stop to try all the different kind of snacks!What we loved about it was it‚Äôs variety, though you can find almost the same food at each stand... it‚Äôs a nice atmosphere to soak in!We had the braised pork intestines, tteokbooki (not sure if I‚Äôm spelling this right), japchae! Also bought a bag of mandarin oranges from JeJU!We came around 1pm and it was bustling! Easy to get here on foot from the subway!"
35,3.0,I enjoy the crowd but the food I ate was pretty so-so. I had Korean pancake and it was too oily for me. Even so I would like to give it a try again with other stall. The sidedish stall looks yum. The market was clean but some vendor might be a bit aggressive.
36,4.0,Good way to see Korean local culture. Lots of opportunity to eat local food and shop for Staples. You can find some shopping for tourists but basically a place to immerse in a culture. Worth a few hours of your time
37,5.0,"For a foodie like me, this place was like a foreign haven. It has all sorts of Korean food. Absolutely worth the extra pounds I gained!"
38,5.0,This is a fabulous place to come and try some great Korean food. Snack your way around the market and leave stuffed and satisfied.
39,4.0,It‚Äôs definitely a place that has abundance of food. Come in the morning and try the variety out. There‚Äôs a millet cake with red bean that‚Äôs really famous but personally I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best. There‚Äôs a lot of textiles as well as plants. A lot of fabrics to make coats and shirts and many shops sells souvenirs and Hanbok (Korean traditional dresses). There‚Äôs salted fishes as well as raw octopus for consumption.
40,5.0,This is my favourite market on earth. A lot of delicious street food all over the market. It‚Äôs the true part of daily life in the city. I highly suggest visiting the market for a true local experience.
41,4.0,"Probably the best place to try one of korean specialty food, yukhoe, sannakji, and bindaetteok! They also sell a lot of korean sidedish (banchan)a"
42,5.0,"We came mainly for the raw beef and octopus. There are many small restaurants selling the same thing. We picked one with a good review and it is actually a Michelin Star restaurant, how surprising! The food tasted so good and fresh. There are also booths selling pancakes, fish cakes, tteokbokki, kimbap and other snacks."
43,5.0,"Despite being a market, it was clean and feels very comfortable. Great place to have a simple meal. Would recommend the greenbean pancake, gimbap and bibimbap there! Stalls there were very friendly.Went around 4pm on Friday and there wasnt a lot of people. Great time to eat and buy souvenirs & tidbit/snacks."
44,4.0,"Traditional or modernized? It's a mixture of both as there are stalls that remain tradition selling traditional stuff while some furnished their shop with air-conditioner selling Hanboks. They are divided into sections just like other markets in Seoul that makes it very clear which section you are in. There is a section selling food, which, normally patronized by tourists more than locals. The food stalls there selling identical food stuff so tourists can just choose any stalls to eat them. There are also shops surrounding the food stalls selling food items too, perhaps slightly more expensive as they dun seem to be crowded unlike the stalls outside. You can get most the stuff you need from this market, from raw food to cooked side dishes, cloths, mattresses, blankets, Hanboks to cooking wares."
45,5.0,"Eating from the stalls is a must. The food is good but the whole experience is what I like, it reminds you of where you are as it is very ‚ÄòKorean‚Äô. I had lived in Korea for 3 years and I really enjoyed being in the bustle of the market."
46,3.0,"Gwangjang market located a stone throw away from Jongno 5-ga exit 1, is rather overrated. When I visited, it was packed and although there were many stores, they mostly served similar things. Price wise, I would say it's rather reasonable. My friend and I ended up buying our food and walking over to Cheonggyecheon Stream to enjoy our food away from the crowd."
47,3.0,"Usual food they sell here are seafood pancakes, kimbaps and noodles. Cheaper prices but limited variety of food. There are more food choices outside the market for a dollar or two more."
48,4.0,"Our guide mentioned that if we say Gwangjang Market, he gets hungry just by remembering how good their Korean pancakes there. So we got curious and went to see the place. We took the bus and it's very convenient because it stops right in front of the market. We ate their Korean pancakes (pajeon) of course. There's a lot variety, vegetarian, or with meat or seafood. The place sells a lot of other things, food stuffs. It's a great place for people who loves to eat!"
49,4.0,It is a traditional market where you can find all kind of local products where the local would go. There is even a eatery place where you choose and eat.
50,5.0,"I went here suuuuper hungry and I was not disappointed with the food! Tried mayak kimbap, sundae, odeng etc etc and yukhoe (raw beef) which was really goood! I don't even eat raw food, but when I had this... It was just good and did not taste raw at all! They also have fruits and other stuff, but the highlight is definitely the food the serve. The price is very reasonable and the place is very easy to locate."
51,5.0,"The market visit was an interesting one as sellers where anxious to have you sit down and eat the food that they were cooking. Local people ignored us tourists and enjoyed their meal. Some of the local dishes were not for the faint of heart. Our guide took us through a factory where costume jewelry was being made for retailers through out the world. There were several hundred little shops with one tow two people working. Nothing was for sale to the general public, It was amazing to see how nimble the workers could put things together and how quickly they could do it. A nice experience."
52,4.0,"Lots of food stalls in the area.  However, there are sections of various but similar food.  For example, one area was for the korean pancakes, another for seafood, and another for pork feet and blood sausgae, etc... In addition, there were shops for traditional wear and Korean snacks.  You can use the Seoul City Tour hop on and off service to get here or arrive via other modes of transport."
53,3.0,All the stalls seemed to be selling the same type of street food.  Not much of a variety. Left the place after trying out some of the food and purchased some kimchi.
54,5.0,"It's a traditional market with a mix of prepare food stalls and shops with areas to buy raw ingredients. A must see for anyone coming to Seoul wanting to taste of traditional Korean food. The shop and stall owners can be a bit too friendly trying to get you to eat there, but its all part of the charm. It is jam packed at night so if you want to visit, I recommend going for lunch and sampling food as you walk through. There is some variety in types of food you see but generally encompasses: kimbap(Korean seaweed rice rolls), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), Jeon (battered pancakes with fish, veggies and meats). Food is cheap and non pretentious. Bring an empty stomach and an open mind to try a few new things."
55,4.0,"I use naver map to walk to this building from my hotel , lots of made in China clothes , wares here . Came here for food only where we had the fried pancake which was delicious , the fish üêü steamboat we had there was tasty üòã, one of the shops was Michelin star for beef tartare with raw egg on top , live octopus üêô ."
56,3.0,"Great place for Korean local foods. Lots of stalls all selling similar food items. Aside from that, not much is worth visiting and I believe most tourists come here just for the food, as we didn't see people checking out the stores that're lined around the whole market."
57,5.0,"This is a market over a hundred years old.  Inside there are many shops selling Korean traditional food and you can sit there to enjoy the tasty food like kimbap, dumpling, seafood etc.  They use electric cushion so that u wouldn‚Äôt feel cold."
58,3.0,The food stalls here sell about the same items. A must try is the pancakes at a corner sit-down eatery near the entrance. You'll have to wait in line there and all the customers eat that dish!
59,5.0,"It was so cool place. I've been there for a while. I love there foods and vibes : ) I think there is perfect place to feel the traditional market of Korea.I've visit Gwanghwamoon, insadong and Gwangjang market. those Foods are pretty cheap and delicious. Acually I've been visited few years ago in Summer. It was so hot ....... so it would be better to visit in Winter.you can also buy so many kinds of Souvenir in there. Have fun and enjoy that place"
60,4.0,"Enjoyed some mung bean pancakes with some alcohol which made for a memorable meal. Shops sold the same stuff - the usual street food fare like pancakes, kimbap, fish cakes, etc."
61,5.0,"Please try not to rush through. Enjoy the sights, sounds, people, and atmosphere. Found this excellent booth with snacks to bring home. Sorry, I can't help you find it. The ahjumma was the bomb."
62,4.0,This place is for people that enjoy traditional Korean dishes in a street style dining style. My favorite is cucumber kimchee but they're are many unique dishes to explore.
63,4.0,"Subway to Jongno 5-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 8 OREuljiro 4-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 2 & 5), Exit 4. There will be tourist guide personnel in red outfit patrolling the place. Stop them for directions if you need. There will always be 2 walking together; 1 speaks Mandarin and the other English.No need to worry which entrance or gate you are going in, as the one place is not really that big and it's interlinked. We visited the 2 famous stalls highly raved for their Gimbak (rice roll aka japanese maki) and Bindaettok (fried pancake). You can get bonchan or side dishes there. They help to wrap them in boxes and triple wrapped in cling wrap. Prices is quite competitive and varieties are quite standard. If you want more varieties, can get from Lotte supermarket and prices are quite close."
64,4.0,You can get all sorts of Korean local street food here. We bought snacks and souvenirs at pretty low price in this market. Recommended for those who would like to get some Korean souvenirs for their loved ones.
65,5.0,"This was by far the best part of our trip. It‚Äôs an outdoor market where you eat local food, drink local beer, and have soju.The food vendors are lovely, friendly and fun. We tried almost everything and it was all amazing.The market has little souvenirs you can buy around the center as well as fresh food market. The other side is purely textiles.The food vendors are right in the center so you can‚Äôt miss them."
66,4.0,"This huge market gives a traditional look at Korean foods, clothing, fabrics, notions---so many items that one can spend an entire day at Gwangang or other markets in Korea.  Go hungry so you can sample a variety of foods.  This market had beautiful hanboks--traditional Korean dress.  The children's clothes and adornments were especially charming."
67,5.0,many kinds of streetfood to eat. Really crowded at weekend. Should go a bit early. Really close to Cheonggyecheon Stream.
68,3.0,"This is one of the more touristy spots. Lots of Korean friends and Seoul natives said they'd never been there before. There are dozens of food spots - friends told me to always go to/wait for shops that are packed, as those are often the ones with the best dishes. It's definitely easier to go with a Korean-Speaking friend (not as English-accessible as other markets and neighborhoods)."
69,3.0,It is kind of dirty and always crowded. Most of foods are cheap. ($2-5) some foods are not. Don't expect clean dishes.
70,4.0,"One of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul. Street food galore! They are famous for their mungbean pancakes & the mayak kimbap (minature sushi rolls). There is no other place I would go for mungbean pancakes. In addition they sell many In addition to food, they sell a large variety of inexpensive goods.  Sometimes we found that the souvenirs are less expensive here than Namdaemun."
71,4.0,"Apart from being promoted as one of the traditional market you have to visit, this place is really worth your time! You can find Korean delicacies from street foods to a full course meal, Korean snacks, hanbok shops, clothes shops, medicine shops, wide ranges of Kimchi, seafoods, and Korean souvenirs at bargain price. Especially for food, you should try the market's signature foods including makjang kimbab, bindaetteok, tteokbokki, nakji, sundae, and red bean porridge. The best time to visit is in the afternoon. There are food stalls with similar foods but if you have time for some researches, you can try to find the best, the oldest and legend one among them to taste the best delicacies."
72,3.0,Lots of stores however doesn't feel very unique. Just textiles and food stalls. Not sure if I would come back.
73,4.0,"I came to Gwangjang with a couple of friends in the height of summer (early July), and the atmosphere was everything you would expect from an Asian food market. It was sweltering with only the occasional fan; it was dense with people bustling by to get their fill of kimbap; and it was very local. The general sentiment was that you were one of only a handful of foreigners wandering the place, and the local ajummas (Korean old ladies) were constantly trying to herd you to sit down and partake in their delicious, sesame-infused offerings so that they could prove to other onlookers that they were tourist friendly. Many of the workers and food purveyors spoke enough broken English for you to get your food and get it paid for without any problems, but it was kind of a moot point, because each little stall only had a handful of options, and they usually had their dishes set out so you could just point and ask for an order. There were little stalls that specialized in kimbap (some offer a tuna version, so just ask for ""cheum chi"" kimbap if you are tired of the garden variety), others ""japchae"" (Korean cold glass noodles with veggies), and others Korean potato pancakes with leeks (and a scrumptious onion sauce that you should ask for double portions of). Overall, the food was good and some of the food purveyors were really friendly, but others weren't. I made the idiotic mistake of forgetting to ask a stall owner how much a handful of mandu (Korean dumplings) was before the lady plopped them into the steamer. She told me afterwards that they were $5 (the standard street price is between $1-2). Luckily, she was sulking about something and forgot to get the mandu back out of the boiling water while I was eating the rest of my meal, so I left just after I finished my other entree. She could overcharge another customer for those later.Ladies like that are usually the exception. But, it's Seoul. It's fast paced, and people are churning out thousands of customers every Saturday night. It's not a perfect experience, it's just an experience. Sure, there are flies buzzing over some of the dishes, but this is what you're paying for. You could easily buy kimbap in a convenience store, or you could get the local atmosphere and eat your Korean pancake awkwardly while sitting over a plastic stool made for a toddler, surrounded by heaps of trash and excitable scads of locals. Just head over to Gwangjang."
74,4.0,"Came here Saturday evening with friends to try the famous mung bean pancakes. We ended up making our way around the market trying mini kimbaps, japchae, tteokbokki, and the mung bean pancakes from different stalls. Everything we tried was delicious. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that other food markets I've been to have more variety. Definitely worth a visit though for the food and local vibe!"
75,4.0,"A busy Asian market: crowded, noisy, with unfamiliar items, but that's part of the experience of going!The highlight was definitely the mung bean pancake.  The stall we ate at was in the middle of intersecting paths - yum"
76,4.0,"If you are looking for a place for shopping, it may not be a good choice as it is mainly a fabric market, with limited shops selling seafood, snack, and fruits. However, near the Eastern gate, there are loads of shops selling traditional food such as the raw octopus, and traditional noodle. Some oof them provided English and Chinese menu. Better compare the price before sitting down as the price are quite different in different shops."
77,3.0,A must-see tourist spot. Go there for breakfast. Line of stalls for people to sit there and eat. Traditional market for tourists and convenient from the station.
78,4.0,"3-5 mins walk from subway (Jongno 5-ga Station-Line 1), Exit 8.  The food very nice and not expensive, as it considers street food varieties. You can see a lot of fruits, hanbok, cooking utensils, etc over here.  There is a big stall selling all snacks, candy just at the entrance of the market."
79,2.0,"I went with my European friend who visited Korea for the first time to show him a Korean local market food. As soon as we got in the food section. people were luring us very loudly and kept forcing us to order. That was also quite annoying for us to decide the shop. My friend asked me a name of the food, so I just was watching without asking. Then the owner, understood English, said chicken and started to prepare the dish even we did not order nor seating, whatso ever. My friend didn't want to. So we walked. All of sudden, behind us , the lady started insulting, shouting us swering words in Korean! I was very very startled and offended. When we chose a shop nearby for a glass noodle, the owners were not nice either even if we ordered the dish. And kept us pushing order more dishes. It was around 10 pm after dinner, we went just for snacks, but most of ladies(owners) were rude, and very harsh! As far as I know, this spot has been quite famous and popular but with this kind of rudeness and ill-mannered ways, I have doubt about their longevity. When I tasted the food, it is below average taste. Of Course it is cheap food. I could also see some flies on the unwrapped food in the air. I wondered how these food will survive during the hot summer! They do not have any hygienic concept, I guess. I could see they do not clean their hands properly to serve after eating something. There are a few seating restaurants which are kind and nice with better food in this place, but I should have searched in advance and should come during the daytime. I do not recomend the open air shops to eat."
80,5.0,"Where can I start. Gwangjang market is like nothing you have seen before. Numerous food stalls and lots of friendly locals.You will need to be brave to sample what's on offer and its best to have a good look around first before you decide what goes on your plate!This place is very kind to your pocket, I spent a good couple of hours here and hardly spent anything. This is a must see place if you are travelling to Soeul."
81,5.0,"Gwangjang Market is a great cultural and food experience. Everything from knick knacks, beautiful clothes and blankets, and everything you can imagine to eat. So fun watching the cooking stalls prepping the food, and seeing all the interesting food. Great place for dumplings and pancakes. Wish I had all day to eat my way through this site."
82,5.0,The best textile market. Many hand made farmers. You can be fitted and clothing seen for you. Seamstresses in the isle ways working and also in the shops. This is Hanbok haven!!
83,4.0,"My girlfriends and I recently visited Seoul and although I have been to Seoul numerous times before, I have never been to this market. We took the subway there and it was not difficult locating the market. We were hunting for good local food and found them at the bibimbap stall no. 39 where we ordered the famed dish along with some dumplings, octopus and chicken feet. I didn't fancy the chicken feet but my friends sang praises of it. In fact, we went to the same stall several days later and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Each dish was 5k Korean won.After tucking into the food, we went around hunting for local souvenirs. This can be found scattered all around the markets. In fact, many shops carry similar goods and all one would need to do is to find the best prices for the goods. Later on, we stopped to have one of the pancakes but it was huge and we could only finish half of it amongst the 5 of us ladies. You would need about half a day or slightly over that at least to do justice to this place. The market is only a short distance from the famous Dongdaemun market along with the many fashion malls."
84,4.0,"Lots to shop and eat but crazy crowded! We were pushed, grabbed and elbowed by the crowd, mainly the elderly ladies. Be prepared to brave the madness during weekends! Despite that we still enjoyed a scrumptious and authentic lunch over there. Bought some local goods and made our way out right after!"
85,5.0,"It's kind of a traditional place to eat at night, street food everywhere, any kind of, delicious potato pancakes, blood sausages, kimpab, pork legs etc. the most popular there is raw beef with raw egg on the top - long lines of people could waiting for their turn outside. Also raw and alive octopus is very delicious here"
86,5.0,Great market food experience. Many stalls with tons of options. Recommend to keep orders small to try as many dishes as possible :)
87,4.0,Full of local and tourist who were on a food hunt. This is a place to go for some local food.Recommended to walk around before ordering as there are some stalls who had the same menu. Wish we could have the capacity to eat more as there is so many things to eat but we were full from just 3 types of food as the servings was huge.
88,5.0,"I enjoy walking through this market - all the varieties of food stalls, different types of seafood on display at fish vendors...all the locals are eating great local cuisine."
89,5.0,"I miss Asian market; particularly a traditional night market with lots of food stalls and fresh groceries. It was on top of my list to visit since I learned of it from a travel book. Sadly, I did not get to try any of the pancakes. Still, it is pure entertaining to people watch and enjoy the sight. I bought few dry food; and now realize that I probably could/should have bought a lot more!  It was slightly overwhelming but fun. t would recommend anyone not to miss this experience."
90,4.0,"I'd rather say traditional food market cause I'm not a big fan of traditional stuff except for FOOD! If you happen to come here, please try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancake), it's quite oily but worth it. The crispiness and the texture, omg and the sauce (onion and soy sauce i think), I CANNOT. Besides, there's this raw seafood plater which is incredibly good! I would eat San nakji (Raw minor Octopus). A lot of people couldn't stand looking at it cause it's cut into smaller pieces and because they are raw, they're still wriggling and jiggling HAHAHA. But I love it. Go and try for yourselves."
91,4.0,"This is the place to go to eat like the locals. There are stalls everywhere mainly set up through the middle of each long corridor with restaurants along the side. Each ""stall"" will cook their specialty for you. Price ranges between 5000 - 10000 won. It's communal seating and if you are there during winter, the seats are heated too!So many options that you won't know what to order. Best order and share from one stall and then move on to another. There are also other stalls which sells their side dishes, seafood, dried foods, cakes etc.   Quite a good place to walk around."
92,4.0,"We came here on our 12 hour layover from LAX to Chiang Mai.  I've never been to South Korea so I figured it would be a good chance to see a little of it for free.  We took a 5 hour free tour from ICN which took us to a village and the market.  I wanted to try Bulgogi in Korea so we found a place but it was just ok.  Next we tried the dumplings and dumpling soup.  These were better than the bulgogi, but we were full and couldn't try anything else."
93,4.0,Love the bad set. Very sweet and comfy. The cotton were very cheap and affordable. here is where to get cheap souveniors
94,5.0,"This place is always a delight to visit! I have gone three times now. Once in the summer, fall, and even winter. When the heat is too much to bear it's nice to get a cold bowl of Namyeong and when's it's freezing in Korea hot tteokbokki always hits the spot. They even warm the benches for you in the winter. All in all the food is amazing and the atmosphere is fascinating. This is a must see and experience in Seoul!"
95,5.0,"Come hungry. We had a one day stopover in Seoul and chose this market for lunch. So glad we did. Fortunately we had taken in a historical morning walk and palace tour before we arrived because we were ready for lunch. Note: Walk the whole food sections before you sit down to eat. There is a wide variety of stalls and types of food. Pick the one, two or more that appeal to you most, then try something you have no idea what it is!. Ddeokbokki, bibimbap, kimchi, bindaetteok, pajeon, kimbap, jasaek goguma to name just a few. Some of the portions can be overwhelming so bring a friend, order a variety and share. After you have had your fill, finish walking the multiple lanes of stalls of local made wares, household goods, fabrics and anything else you could think of. Then grab some cookies and candies to take home for later after you have recovered. Be prepared for the crowds, it is a popular place and seats can be few."
96,4.0,This is the place to be if you are feeling hungry near Dongdaemun. You will find lots of authentic korean food to fill your tummy.
97,5.0,"I stumbled on this market quite by coincidence while just roaming. I tried the Kyoja here. This place was interesting enough to come twice - once by chance, and the other time by design. The second time, I looked at the other wares sold there and bought a neck pillow that had a case made from traditional fabric. This place is interesting, the storekeepers are very friendly, and it's a good place to just be."
98,4.0,came to gwangjang market to eat and there are literally lots of food to eat. And they are all delicious! I tried tobboki (not sure how to write it) and gimbab.
99,1.0,"Ugh! As a Korean, I feel so bad foreigners come here and have to eat fake, dirty, over-priced food. The market seems big, but when you look around you will realize most sellers sell similar food with same price. If I must recommend one market for you, i will guide you to either Tongin Market near by Gyeongbok palace or Mangwon Market near Hongdae. If you really really want to see what Gwangjang market looks like, just look. Don't try food here :( especially if you are trying street food for the first time."
100,5.0,"Gwangjang Market is one of my favourite places to explore in Seoul, also one of the oldest traditional markets in South Korea. At Gwangjang Market, you must try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancakes), a snack that's greatly loved by the locals. It goes down really well with Makgeolli (rice wine)!"
101,5.0,"Local Korean food in the street food atmosphere. Various type of Foods, seafood, steaming, hotpot or fried. Don't expect that you will sit in a nice restaurant because it will be just a bar seat, eat and go. Just pick one, the most long queue.There are also clothing and tourists stuffs available in the market."
102,2.0,"visited there to try yuk-hoi(uncooked beef), but it's far too hyped and not worth it especially with that much of people and hassle."
103,5.0,"Heaps of stalls, cheap food. It ranges from the confrontational live octopus kind to straightforward vegetarian friendly options. Its cooked fresh, the locals are happy to squeeze up and make room for you, nobody minds if you don't speak Korean. I had a ball."
104,3.0,"This market gives you a taste of the local culture in Seoul. For a unique local experience, have your lunch or dinner here. Avoid weekends at nights as it can get extremely crowded."
105,4.0,"One of the best shopping destination for tourists looking for local products. Also there are a lot of store selling colorful Hanbok. There are Goods, accessories clothes in very inexpensive price."
106,4.0,"Said to be the biggest market, this place sells everything from clothing through traditional medicines to food.The place is known for traditional mung bean pancakes.It is not touristy and the majority of visitors seem to be locals.Worth a visit in the evenings."
107,5.0,"We stopped by to have a quick browse of the market while walking past along cheongye stream to Dongdaemum. Should have saved my stomach to have our meal here as there was so much food to try. In the centre of the market there are heaps of little food stalls where they sell various korean food- street food. Dokbokki, soondae, gimbap, bindaeteok (mung bean pancake - a must try), bibimbap, savoury pancakes, noodles etc. Each stall has some seats surrounding it so you can sit down to eat or you can buy your food to take away.I didn't get the chance to walk around the other areas of the market but i did walk past an area where they sold lots of fabric/ material and also saw quite a few stores selling packaged korean snacks"
108,5.0,"You can buy traditional items here! It's cheaper and lots of shops which is easier to find. There are many shops that sell different types of kimchi. You can tell them you are buying back and taking a flight, they will help you wrap up . They sell lots of fabric and buttons . It is a textile centre!"
109,3.0,"It was crowded past afternoon. Most food stalls sell the same types of food. As we went on Sunday, some shops were closed."
110,4.0,Our hotel was across the street from the gwangjang market. We came here for snacks and a couple times for lunch. There are a variety of outdoor stores and you should be able to find anything including counterfeit clothes.  The gem are the little small stalls with as affordable snacks and food.
111,4.0,There is a lot of street food here at very affordable prices. Fresh food and vegetables too. Good location is Seoul
112,1.0,"Food was mediocre at best. You can get better street food at other districts such as Hongdae or Ewha at a cheaper price. Many of the vendors are hostile too. The next morning, I talked to the receptionist at my accommodation about Gwangjang and she told me that Koreans find Gwangjang to be a ""terrible place"" (with her limited vocab) and asked who recommended me there. My advice is to skip this place and visit Namdaemun Market instead."
113,4.0,One thing about this place is it's your typical market. People selling food and stuff for a cheap price. The cleanliness of the place can be a bit doubtful but one can never be to careful. Someone recommended this place to me since i told them i haven't have Japche and Gimbop and i found them here however i was a bit dissapointed when one seller used her barehands to get the japche and place it in a plastic bowl for me to eat. The taste was really good though and i wasn't able to find other places selling it. Tried their mung bean pancake and it was good. We went here a little early so there wasn't much people and not everything was open yet. I think the best time to go here would be afternoon to night time.
114,4.0,"The Gwangjang Market is nearby Dongdae Mun. I knew the place from Korean variety show ‚Äì Running Man. They had some games and ate some delicious food in the traditional market. I was totally attracted with Gwangjang Market. Therefore, I recorded this place in my Korean schedule.  It was my first time went to the market, so it was hard for me to find the location. Fortunately, met nice local people helped me to find market. Arrived the market around 6 p.m. so decide to have dinner in there. At the time, there was not so many people. A lot of stalls closed, most of them all sold the same type of food. I found a stall and seated to enjoy the food.  The stall‚Äôs auntie was so friendly, she tried to speak a little Chinese to me. She was very cute, feed me to eat the food and then took picture. I was so surprised that her actions.  It was an unforgettable experience in Seoul."
115,5.0,"Had a great time visiting this market, the different foods were just amazing, in fact there was so much to sample we had to go back another day. The mung bean pancakes were fantastic as well as the dumplings and the Korean fried chicken.All in all this is a must visit if you are visiting Seoul."
116,4.0,"This is just a ridiculously busy spot but we went back twice.  The Mung bean pancakes which can be had from numerous sellers here is simply outstanding. I had a couple of varieties and enjoyed it all as well as spicy ricecakes, korean fried chicken, gimbap, sweet potato pancakes and the list goes on!"
117,5.0,"I was so glad the this gigantic market was just down the street from my hotel.  It is a world of its own: over 200 stalls selling food; textiles, clothing, you name it!  a MUST SEE!"
118,4.0,"My third visit since 2012 ‚Äì I love the cloths here. The cotton and crepe particularly, spoilt for choices and reasonably priced. Compared to those available in Malaysia. The Ahjummas/Ahjushis are friendly, ever willing to show you the cloths spread out.  I buy these to make Malaysian national dress, the baju kurung, to work. The cotton is so comfortable. If you are looking for Korean silk, there is 1 particular store that most regular Malaysians are familiar with. However, I noticed that the store doesn‚Äôt replenish, seeing almost the same pattern that I saw in 2012. Or perhaps only Malaysians buy them‚Ä¶With the fallen ringgit, the price for a 4-meter Korean silk material has gone up but if you are a Malaysian female used to the Kelantan/Terengganu ‚Äúsilk‚Äù, I would recommend try the Korean silk. Beside the cloths, the seaweed here is also much cheaper than those in Myeondong, almost half the price. There are food stalls and souvenir stalls. Quite an interesting place to visit. You have to take line 1 Seoul Metro and get off at Jongno5(o)-ga, as you exit you will see a few pharmacy stores. Take a left, walk a few minutes and you will come to the entrance of Gwangjang market. The path branches out somewhere in the middle, the cloth path somewhere on the right. The rest is food and souvenirs. The market closes early, perhaps 5 pm"
119,5.0,"You can find almost everything whatever it's in this market, EVERYTHING.Food stalls are quite fancy place where you can experience and enjoy local delicacies."
120,3.0,"We came here around 11am and most of the vendors were still closed. Of the vendors that were open, most of them all sold the same type of food. If not food, then clothes and fabric."
121,4.0,"Most of the stalls sold the same food - pancakes, dumplings, jap chae. You can also get live octopus here. There are seats at each stall but you can also get take away. It can get pretty hot in here as it's covered but the ventilation isn't great. Definitely a great experience for first time Seoul visitors."
122,4.0,Lots of nice food with reasonable price.Most of the stall vendors able to converse in English or Mandarin.
123,4.0,"This market sells a lot of food such as sundae, bintaedokk, tteokbokki and more. It's a traditional market and there are people who also sell ctraditional clothes in there."
124,5.0,"Very local yet very touristic, but we encountered no trouble and almost hassle free. One of the very few places we were truly pleased with!Very colorful and very diverse!Food is endless, but literally all the same lol"
125,4.0,"We visited the market at night for food, there are many food stalls manned by friendly aunties that sells various korean traditional street food like kimbap, japchae, sundae, eomuk, etc. and the stalls open until late so lots of people come here for supper and drinks as well. Definitely a nice experience to enjoy good food at a market setting."
126,5.0,"This place is in essence an open market. I found it to be a great choice for souvenirs with decent prices.  However, the real attraction is the food. Tons of street vendors with different food; which, depending  where you are from, some of it might be considered exotic. You can do take out but I think is better to sit down and enjoy the place, just pick one since there are vendors everywhere.  The most common food is the fried pancakes (bindaetteok).  I found them to be very tasty and easy to share (they are big enough); if you are finicky this is probably a safe bet (just a notch below bibimbap). Next on the menu I would add the sausage (sundae), like any other sausage you probably don't want to know what's in it but intestines and blood are likely ingredients. A few places (those with a big line) offer something call yukhoe which is in essence raw beef with raw eggs. It was not my favorite, it tasted like very rare steak (it is literally raw) mixed it with pears and think of it as sushi. Finally after drinking some more soju perhaps try the sannakji. This is a small octopus that you can hold before being sliced. The tentacles are still 'active' and the suction cups might stick to your mouth and throat, a weird feeling. It was too chewy for me. You should try a different vendor for each plate; all plates should be shared. Bring cash since credit cards are not readily accepted. If you are visiting with a local, make sure you learn the custom into drinking soju or beer (like not pour for yourself).  Also, while the alcohol content for the most popular brand of soju is below 17%, take your time as the sweetness might make you drink more than you expect."
127,5.0,"Huge traditional Korean market. I'll go back to try and eat that live octopus, I got scared the first time. While this is a busy market, it is relatively quiet and clean."
128,5.0,"Gwangjang Market is a haven for those who love Korean streetfood, but don't want to have to jostle with the shoppers of Myeongdong or the club lined streets of Hongdae. It's an indoor space, comprised of multiple streets with food vendors, as well has some shops that sell Korean goods that you can purchase to eat or bring home as gifts. Here it's best to deal in won, as many of the vendors sell their food for cheap prices, and only certain ones may have cards. You can get your fill of gimbap, mandu and sundae, or you can opt to be more adventurous and try some infamous san-nakji *live squid* just remember to eat eat eat!"
129,5.0,"We went on a late Sunday morning so the food stalls were open but some stalls selling other stuff were not. Still there was plenty to see. Vendors selling their wares like souvenirs, fresh produce etc. The food stalls here sell more traditional food such as mung bean pancakes, octopus, dumplings, gimbap etc unlike those in Myeongdong. The food here is cheaper too. You order your food and sit right at the stalls to eat. The stalls at the junction seem to be more popular and crowded. It is quite warm. You can take pictures with the live octopus provided you pay for it and eat it. I would say you could spend 1 to 1.5 hrs wandering around. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
130,5.0,"I went there for the greenbean pancake (bindetteok), rice cake, bibimbap and naengmyeon! I must recommend the naengmyeon in a air-conditioned stall at the corner of the long passage of the food stall, big portion and very nice elastic cold noodle!"
131,5.0,"i had some nice korean food here, like the traditional pancake 8delicious) and some other weird stuff. cheap eats and lots of flavours!"
132,5.0,"Great market and no ones really pushy.  Previous reviews are correct in saying you'll pass by 20 different vendors selling the exact same thing, so pick your poison, and then the next section comes up with totally different stuff.  Not much touristy here just lots of food and fabrics.  Nothing is priced so be prepared to barter..  If your not into that don't worry, it's all cheap.  Best you can get is cheaper!  Even if you're not hungry or shopping it's definitely worth wandering around, the sights and smells are phenomenal!  But I encourage you to pull up to a bench, point at something and give it a go :)  taxis, buses and metros close by once ya exit the market from basically any side. Have fun!"
133,3.0,"There are a lot of shop n food there, my friend told me to buy some ginseng there n I found out is really cheap there buy more get more discounts"
134,4.0,"It is relatively easy to reach from the Jongno 5(0)-ga subway. There is a stall at the centre of the market selling delicious pancakes. I bought some traditional snacks, dried goods and kimchi. Do compare the prices between stalls to find the best deal."
135,4.0,"If you're in Korea, you need to try authentic market food and Gwangjung markets is the biggest. This market is famous for it's Potato Jeon which is a must try along with a bottle of Makeolli. Other dishes are not particularly unique to this market however I would try the raw beef (Yukhwe) which is the korean version of steak tartare. A great way to experience Korean culture and cuisine in a market setting which is very different to the restaurants."
136,4.0,Lots of street food vendors and you can find a lot of seafood related dishes around if you like and is not allergic to seafood.
137,3.0,"Finally have the opportunity to visit this market. Conveniently located near to the subway. It is pretty easy to locate it. What made me really excited about it was the sheer size of it. Lots of food offerings. However, after a while you will realise the stores are more or less serving about the same type of food. Nevertheless, it is still fun to try some of the local food there. There are also a lot of Korean traditional costumes there. Too bad did not have the chance to check them out.Besides selling food and Korean traditional costume. It is also a market. With a lot of fresh food offerings. Seafood, assortment of kimchi and Korean traditional cakes. In fact I enjoyed this section more. More varied.Other than these, the market also sell household items. I probably won't return to this market again as there wasn't much differentiation in terms of offerings. But for those who had not been here before, it is still worth an experience visiting it."

They are cheaper here compared to all the other tourists places I have been to.  There are aunts with their food ready to be cooked in the middle of the street and they are all so fresh and good!For adventurous, you can try the octopus sashimi and the sea squirt.  For the non adventurous, like me, it's safe to try the pancake, oden, mandoo and kimbab."
143,4.0,"Easily accessible as it's not far from the Seoul Canal walk, you can pop up from approx 1/3rd the way along and visit.Tons of stalls selling a variety of typical korean street food and even if not planning to buy anything worth going just for the atmosphere. Truly only described as bustling."

I had kimbap, korean pancakes and dumpling soup there spending around 10000 KRW (10 USD) in total, which was great for a lunch.Lots of food stalls where you can find a variety of Korean food, as you may be able to find some Korean souvenirs to buy.Conveniently located near the metro station, which is a plus.If you would like to experience a traditional Korea shopping and food experience, definitely go here!"

You'll discover a wide variety of flavours and mouthwatering stuffs that will satisfy your taste buds. If you will visit Seoul, make sure to take a stop at Gwangjang market. It might just be a little pricey compared to the other vendors you'd encounter at the sidewalks, but when you get there and see that a lot of people are eating, you can't definitely say no to the smell and the ambiance of the busy market."

151,5.0,"Gwangjang market is a fun place to shop and eat. Though we reached there and the stores we closing, we found really pretty hanbok accessories and souvenirs and loved them so much. It is a popular place to make hanbok and every piece looked so pretty! The food section closes much later and you can basically find everything. The kimbap was addictive and tastes different from the ones sold outside. The seaweed that wraps the kimbap was more crispy and tasty. I would go back again. Oh the underground mall at the subway station has more hanbok accessories and I found them a bit cheaper there. Walk around first!"
152,4.0,"I saw reviews about how good the foods here are, but actually when I came here there are nothing that's my tongue gonna missedüòÖ I came here and tried its bindatteok (mung bean pancake) because I watched Running Man and it seemed like they enjoyed the food like sooo much... But when I tried the food, it's basically a fritters with some vegetables. Some nice ahjussi offered me another kind of bindatteok (they claimed it was much more delish than the one that I tried) but when I asked them, it was another kind of bindatteok with porküòÇüòÇ (I am a Moslem, so I dont eat pork).Another thing that I tried was their mayak kimbap (drug kimbap) which famous for being so addictive, but it's just an ordinary kimbap with smaller size. The odeng was also not as good as the one I tried in another street vendor. But for the experience, you might visit this place for sightseeing and seeing locals since there are many locals spending their time in this touristy market."

154,4.0,"A very interesting place. I came on a public holiday (wrong day!!), it was super duper crowded. so definitely avoid public holidays. It was recommended by my Korean teacher because I said I want to eat traditional Korean food. No pasta, no bread, no pizza please. So she recommended this Gwangjang Sijang. Easy to access by public transport. I took a subway from Gwanghwamun. I think it was about a few stops away. I was going to eat sundaegukbap but I just remember that it's pork and my friends were Muslim. So we settled for some jeons (pancake). Most food are pork-based, or soups, very very traditional and a few look homemade to me. Love them to death. Bring a Korean friend! I spoke functional Korean languange for the purpose of the trip. But ahjumma and ahjussi (aunties and uncles) there can be hard to understand and they do not speak English, and you might want to know what's in what food."
155,4.0,"This traditional market is know for food and tradition costume call Hanbok. I heard the price used to be cheaper but since it got famous and became one of tourist attraction site, price went up. But it is still cheaper than U.S. so I did not mind."
156,5.0,Do try their man yak gimbab. The best in town. You can find variety of foods here. You can also buy fresh kimchi and seaweed here. A must visit
157,5.0,"The hustle and bustle, sights, sounds and smells of Gwangjang Market are not to be missed.  Definitely sample some of the food offered and the many stalls.  Korean mung bean pancakes, dumplings, unknown dishes and more all at very affordable prices.  Clothing, souvenirs, whatever!  Just go!"
158,3.0,"The market have many things that tourist as well as local looking for. From food to souvenir and clothing can be find here. Its good to see how local come to lunch here.For Muslim, beware that this eateries may serve pork eventhough they claimed that they just sell seafood."
159,5.0,"This was my only trip to Korea (thus far), and we went to this Kwang Jang market (which I have seen spelled several different ways in English).  It is HUGE - you can find just about anything here ... miles of clothes ... hundreds of street vendors cooking all kinds of Korea dishes.  Be ready to walk a ton of miles because this place is HUGE.  You will see some very odd items in the outdoor food area - like pig's heads, dried fish, etc.  Some of it you won't recognize - but that is the whole point ... great to check oneself out of western civilization, and go experience this!I did try one of the Mung Bean Pancakes ... which are fried.  It was pretty good - although my colleague was scared to eat it.  ha ha"
160,5.0,Korean Food Paradise... ^^ You can try many korean food in here. But carefull with your bellongings because this crowd place to just hang out..
161,5.0,"We've arrived this place a bit late, most of the shops are closed. But we have dinner at the stall in the market. Varieties of foods. Definitely will come here again when i visit seoul"
162,5.0,Came here in the evening to have dinner and it can feel overwhelming at first. There are plenty of food stalls selling similar items. I plonked myself at one of the stalls selling Bibimbap and it was so delicious! Recommended if you want an authentic food experience!
163,5.0,Went to the market based upon Parts Unknown Season 5 episode from Anthony Bourdain. Had the vegetable pancakes and Yaki Mandu dumplings. Very unique place-- haven't seen anything like it in the world. Must see.
164,4.0,"Every time when I visit Seoul, I will definitely go to Gwangjang Market. The market is at Jongno 5 (o)-ga Station, exit 9 & 10. This traditional market has 3 sections, dining, raw food and products. Eating at Gwangjang Market is a MUST. We tried the Bindaetteok (Deep fried pancake) ‚Ç©4,000, Yukhoe (Raw seasoned ground beef with sesame and raw egg) ‚Ç©12,000, Boribap (barley with a selection of veggies) ‚Ç©5,000 and Steam dumpling ‚Ç©5,000. There were so many stalls selling the same foods and same prices, so my tip is to choose the stall with longest queue."
165,4.0,"This is the place to be for authentic and local korean food. It's a food haven where you can find your favourite korean food, street food, and local snacks. Love the gimbap and patbingsu here! Bought my seaweed and rice crackers from here too! There are also sections selling clothes, shoes, hanboks,cloth, souvenirs and all the little knick knacks! A must go place if you are in Seoul!"
166,4.0,"Save your stomach and grab your breakfast at Gwangjang Market! There's plenty of food options and many people go there to buy kimchi, seasoned octopus & other seafood. We walked through a whole street of cloth and textile, shops offering customized hanbok and clothes. Very interesting experience to sit among the locals at a little stall while enjoying the food. I'm amazed at the Koreans' love for alcohol, it was not yet noon and many patrons had a bottle of soju or makkoli with their mung bean pancake. Oh, if you want to try the live octopus, it's available in Gwangjang Market as well!"
167,5.0,"The atmosphere of this local market was awesome. The food were very tasty and affordable. We ate Kimbaps, Jap chae, red bean/pumpkin porridges, sashimi, and topokki in there. We just couldn't stop eating in this place. There were so many foods that we still wanted to eat, but we didn't have enough room in our stomachs to the food. We bought some marinated crabs and octopus in Gwangjang market. Those Ajummas who sold the marinated food were so funny and nice. They even gave us a bag of other marinated seafoods for free b/c they knew that we haven't tried those marinated seafoods before. (In Gwangjang, those Ajummas will give you try the food before you buy. They will also give you free hot tea and yogurt drinks while you are picking the food  --> awesome customer service)Besides food, we also found Korean traditional clothing, bedding stuffs and accessories in the market. It was so easy to find some good traditional stuffs for souvenirs. My friends and I love Gwangjang Market so much! We definitely will go there again! :)"
168,4.0,This is a wonderful place to go IF- you are adventurous-you are with someone who speaks Korean or knows Korean foodOTHERWISE this will be overwhelming.  However it is worth it!!!There is tons of shopping but I would good for all the little stalls of food.  There are tons.Find a seat at a table that looks good and order or just point to what you want.  This is the perfect way to try tons and tons of different Korean foods from dumplings to pancakes to seafood to pigs feet.If you love Bizarre Foods or Anthony Bourdain....this is your kind of place.
169,5.0,"First visit was little bit confused, but the second one with Korean frind was amazing. He took us for some Korean food. We ate a lot. We loved topoki with meat. It is relatively cheap for such a big portions. Lots of Koreans go there even with whole families. You just sit there on a banch and eatiing a food. Very different experience than restaurants."
170,4.0,"Came here for late night eats with my friends. We had the crispy bindaetteok pancakes, soju and makkoli. They also sold bite sized gimbap and beef tartare."
171,4.0,"You can a good variety of local food and snacks in this very well organised market. Stalls selling similar type of food would be clustered together, but the hawkers were very well mannered and we didn't experience any touting or hustling. We stall-hopped to try different food and were very curious, sometimes at a lost to how or what to order. But the owners or local patrons would gladly come to our help, and even taught us how to best enjoy the sashimi that we ordered. Walk around to find some souvenir before going home. A very enjoyable experience on the whole but read up on the opening hours/days before going!"
172,4.0,"Fight your way through the sea of human trout rushing every which way as you jostle, bump and wander your way around this timeless market. Go here on a cold and or rainy morning and plop down at a booth to enjoy steaming hot, deep fried beandeduk pancakes dipped in sugar sweetened soy sauce and vinegar. Mmm. Wash it down with an ice cold makeoli. You can find all sorts of foods to stare at and eat here. And there are plenty of traditional Korean hanbok makers, cloth sellers and the like to visit or admire. Great place to people watch. Just keep an eye out for the motorbikes which for some strange reason are also picking their way through the jam-packed crowds."
173,4.0,"Very very hot inside during summer.Food are very cheap, but not as tasty as other reviews or bloggers said."
174,5.0,"Even if you don't buy anything, it's such a fun & huge place to walk around just looking at all the fabrics, lacquerware & food. I've been to lots of markets throughout Asia & this was probably the cleanest well laid out one. They often feel a little unsafe & cramped but Gwangjang Market is terrific. Prices were good too & they have people in red shirts on that help you with information about the market if you get overwhelmed with options."
175,3.0,"if you want a WIDE variety of street food type options and want to eat local then this place is for you, but if you are looking for tourist style souvenirs then you are better off at namadaemun. gwangjang is not a 'must do' in my opinion but if you have time and are willing to experiment with food then check it out. it's a massive complex so you'll need to spend some time here"
176,5.0,"This market is huge and you can find everything.  It transforms during lunch and dinner time into a huge food market.  I came here multiple times to eat.  The price is great, but you'll have to do a lot of pointing with your hands because very little English is spoken.  Don't worry, the food is still amazing and you won't get hassled.  Otherwise you can easily spend a few hours walking through the maze of shops."
177,4.0,There are a lot of korean traditional foods in gwangjang market and it's cheaper.. Must came with an empty stomach.. I love the bindaeteok so much.. Masisoyoo..
178,5.0,"This market is filled with food stalls, restaurants, fabric stores, some seafood stalls,  etc. The main attraction for me is the abundance of local dishes.  Stalls are set up at the same area usually will sell very similar dishes-which makes it hard to decide which one to go for.  You will be spoilt for choice-kimbap, pigs trotter,  soybean pancake (must try), raw beef, dumplings, bibimbap, glass noodle and many more.  There are at least two hundred food joints. If only i have more space in my stomach to savour the yummy food.  The market is pretty clean and easy to get to via subway."
179,4.0,"Find local food, fresh ginsengs, panchangs (side dishes), boiled fish cakes on a stick, and stores that sell local brass pots (1pkt of ramen size), and silver chopsticks, spoons, rice bowls (with cover) ... I'm crazy about Korean drama hence bought a set of everything (rice bowls, ramen pots, chopsticks & spoons). Price is reasonable too.My mom loves the fresh ginsengs here coz it's much bigger than those in Emart. Bigger ginsengs tends be somewhat sweeter in taste."
180,3.0,"I went with some friends on Friday night, specifically for dinner. We arrived about 10:30 p.m. and only a few food stalls were open. The women who worked at the stall were friendly and not too pushy. We ate mixed jeon, sundae, jokbal (pig's feet) and dalkbal (chicken feet). The prices were a lot more than you would normally pay for this type of food- 10,000 each for the jeon and chicken feet, 8,000 for the jokbal and 7,000 for the sundae. Big bottles of Cass were 5,000 each. There were no prices displayed.I live in Korea so I've tried these dishes before. I was disappointed with the quality of the food, especially for the price. Street food is normally cheap and tasty with prices displayed clearly. It's possible that we were unlucky with the stall we chose, but in a city where there is so much delicious, good value food available, I wouldn't bother giving Gwangjang Market another chance."
181,5.0,We checked this place out on our second last day of our trip which was raining. The more cultural stores that sell the traditional Korean merchandise closed around 6-7pm but the food market was amazing. It was so happening and vibrant and the food looked amazing from all the stands. A great way to eat with the locals and at the same time take in the sights and sounds Seoul has to offer without breaking the bank. There was lots of selection of traditional Korean dishes. Pick and choose what you love and follow your nose.
182,1.0,Um..what the heck is everyone talking about in this reviews??? This was the most bizarre market I've been to in Asia. There were basically 4 sections of the EXACT SAME FOODS for all the stalls. 1 section dedicated to animal intestines. 1 section for pancakes. 1 for misc. etc. It was so bizarre. There was no variety. Crowds packed inside. This is a definite TOURIST TRAP. They bring all the Chinese tourist in here to pack it up. Not worth visiting.
183,4.0,"I lived in Seoul for two years, and every single time I had a person visit me, I would bring them to Gwangjang Shijang. This market is great for three reasons: the delicious bindaeduk, the great atmosphere, and the massive thrift shop on the second floor.Bindaeduk:Bindaeduk is a Korean ""pancake"", but it's not sweet at all. In fact, it's kind of salty and you dip it in soy sauce. Trust me, you HAVE to try it, and after living in Seoul for two years, I'm convinced that you HAVE to try it at Gwangjang Shijang. Sharing some Bindaeduk with Makoli - sweet and thick rice wine - is a match made in heaven. Atmoshpere:The market it set up so that there are dozens of vendors who all have their own small booths with heated benches. The market is technically inside, but there are huge entrances without any doors so it's cold in there. I like to drink makoli in the winter time because it does a great job of warming you up. Sitting on a heated seat, drinking makoli, and eating bindaeduk is so delicious and cozy; it's an absolute must do. Thrift Shop:The thrift shop has tons of clothing from easily one hundred vendors. I have bought a bunch of clothing from there that I still wear years later. As an American who lived in Korea for two years and LOVES Korean food, I would have to say that 80% of the food in this place is not the best. The other twenty percent consists of bindaeduk and the various porridges offered, which are fantastic. In conclusion, this place is great and I think that it should be a top five attraction if you're visiting, especially in the winter. To be able to sit down with friends on heated seats, drink makoli, and eat delicious bindaeduk is one of the coziest and most enjoyable things that you can do in Seoul."
184,3.0,"You can find all kinds of local food here in this market. people can sit in front of the stalls, pick and order their food. pay after food. I tried the Ìò∏Î∞ïÏ£Ω (pumpkin porridge) and Îñ°Î≥µÏù¥ (Tteokbokki). The price is still reasonable. However, when i walked around the market, i found that some of the food are not  cheap either. They are more expensive than other places (same food but different price). They even sell food that you may not even think of trying. (just saying). Overall, nice food."
185,4.0,"When it comes to the word ""market"", most people would think it's the place to do grocery shopping (i.e: buying vegetable goods to cook for next meal)Gwangjang Market has more than that. If you're looking for traditional hanbok (for grownups and children, ready made or custom tailored ones), this is the place. Also, one of many places to have traditional food like the bibimbap, tteokbokki, patbingsu and bindatteok."
186,4.0,"Always amusing to visit this market for the pancakes and rice beer. The raw beef dishes are good too. Always busy and noisy, but fun to watch people eat various strange foods, and the strange goods for sale."
187,5.0,"I purchased several childrens hanboks here. There is one stall selling kids hanboks in the upper level hanbok market, and several stalls on the ground level. Kids hanboks are $60 and up. The food market portion is fantastic! Try the fresh and piping hot bindaetteok."
188,4.0,"great variety of food but some might be just soso. So, the best way to try out is to go with few friends. u can go from stall to stall ( hop stall). share the food and the cost! eat all u can!"
189,4.0,"It's quite a large place, so I suggest that, when it comes to food, you walk through the whole place at least once, before deciding what you want to eat. Basically, you have 5-6 main sections/areas, determined by what food the stalls are selling (in a specific area, all the stalls would be selling the same things, such as the stalls selling fried pancakes will be located next to each other, while the stalls serving live octopus and fresh seafood sashimi are located together etc).Eventhough most of the stall owners don't speak English, they'll serve you with great enthusiasm. The seafood served here is very fresh - and if you're not squirmish about swallowing a still-wriggling tentacle of a baby octopus, it really doesn't get any fresher than that! And of course, they are well-known for their famous fried pancakes. These come in various varieties, such as the ones made with only mung beans, another made with mung beans and pork and yet another from mung beans and seafood. Served freshly fried and piping hot, with sliced onions in a dark vinergary dipping sauce, this is a tasty snack that will fill you up quite a bit. And then of course, for pork lovers, you'll find lots of that here for you to tuck into, everything from 1 end of the pig to another, both as hot and cold dishes.Besides the food stalls, you'll find many other stalls and shops at Gwang Jang Market selling a plethora of things, from all sorts of kimchi, other pickled items, dried fish and seafood, to handmade bags and shoes; from fresh vegetables, fruits and fish, to ginseng, seaweed, cookies and traditional hangboks. It's an enjoyable experience while visiting Seoul - especially for trigger-happy photography enthusiasts!But take note that it can get very crowded, so it's always a good idea to watch you belongings at all times. Always better to be safe than sorry."
190,5.0,"Wet market, probably not for the faint-hearted. Good place to find authentic Korean street foods sold by ahjummas. Just sit at the stall and ask away. A little Korean might come in handy to avoid irritating the ahjumma sellers; words like ""juseyo"", ""mekju"", ""eolmaeyo"" and your Native Korean numbers (hana, dul, set etc). Definitely the place to get the real local experience!P.S: Hanboks here are cheaper too! There are some hanbok tailor shops there. Unless you're a fluent Korean speaker, it is best to get a translator. I was lucky I brought along some Korean friends when I wanted to get my hanbok there."
191,4.0,"You can take a lovely walk along cheongyecheon stream and then end up at this market for lunch/tea.Terribly busy and crowded...so expect lots of jostling but a good place to try different Korean specialties, pick up sundries and even hanboks.Expect to spend a couple of hours at least!Definitely worth a visit.On the opposite side of the stream is another market which is haven for baking enthusiasts with cookie cutters and chocolate moulds."
192,3.0,"It's a large touristy market similar to many markets around Seoul. The subway drops you pretty much in front.If you're visiting Seoul for a short while it's a nice distraction for a couple of hours with typical but tasty Korean street food. I stay away from any of the raw seafood due to a previous bad experience. BTW, the public toilet in the market is filthy so use the one in the subway before or after your visit. Do try the bindaeddeok (savory pancake). It's quite tasty there.People make a big deal of the mayak gimbap (rice and seaweed rolls) - meh. It's not worth the money.Soondae. You have to like bloodsausage. These taste funkier than European style but not bad. Jokkbal or pigsfeet. greasy but good.I wouldn't say don't try any of the food. You should. Just understand what you're going to eat.Lots of souvenirs and very Korean products like hanboks and local kitchen goods.Not a bad place to get tailored good. The fresh food and kimchi section is pretty cool. Lots of different types of kimchi to check out. Beware of the smell."
193,5.0,"I saw this place on an episode of Running Man, and came here specifically to try everything that I saw! My sister and I walked around for a while, looked at the shops. We saw so many different food that we wanted to try, but we settled on one stand. We got 5 different dishes, maybe a few too many, we couldn't finish everything, and the ahjumma put everything in plastic bags for us to take back to our apartment. A great place to come for lunch if you're looking for some traditional Korean food, not from a chain restaurant!"
194,4.0,"We went here with a Korean friend so it was not difficult to buy Korean Pancakes and Magkeolli wine. We ate with the other Koreans, and of course, it was privileged to experience eat in an open resto inside the market.YOu can see lots of food and souvenirs! We were not able to buy souvenirs as it was already late and we still have some places to go!"
195,4.0,"Gwangjang Market is the oldest open market in Seoul and may possibly one of the largest.  There are miles and miles of vendors selling just about everything.  The bean pancakes are the food items they are best known for, but there are many other dishes such as drug kimbap and pig's feet, Many of the vendors also sell dozens of buckets of side dishes and of course you can take a taste test before committing.  It is definitely worth your time because you'll trip on just about everything there."
196,5.0,"One of my korean friends took me here and the first thing to overwhelm me was the many delicious sights and scents of the various food options. Get a giant latke (i know it's not called that but for purposes of this review it's a pretty good comparison) with soy/vinegar sauce and some beef sashimi with rice wine. Lots of good food to be had at reasonable prices, and there are endless shopping options whether you're looking for tailored suits, traditional clothing, or just a pair of socks. I loved it so much I ate here twice."
197,2.0,"We arrived at this market in the evening and was eager to get some dinner. My friend wanted to try the Mandu, hence we approached one of the stalls serving this cuisine. We were approached by a Chinese speaking lady, in which she usurer us to the seats. We ordered 2 bowls for sharing (as we wanted to eat something else after this), but the lady insisted that we must order 1 bowl for each person. She claimed it is a rule here and everyone does the same. We complied. A while later, we saw a local couple just bought 1 small plate of mandu for sharing. They even brought food elsewhere to the shop to eat. We then confronted the lady and she gave lots of excuses on why others were exempted from this rule. But then, we had already finished all the food and paid here the money at the start. Hence, we are left with a full (but unhappy) stomach. Too full to try other food in the place"
198,2.0,"I went here primarily to try the street food, but found the variety of food sold rather limited. We had pancakes, spicy rice cake, and kimbap. Other stuff we found as we walked along were mainly soup dishes or stuffed intestines. Every shop was selling the same usual things, and there were some restaurants. Unless you are looking to buy traditional Korean clothes, all the shops selling gifts were pretty much similar.The stretch of Myeongdong and all its street food had more variety than this place, although they were different food."
199,4.0,"The vendors don't really speak English, so be sure to find a stall with other tourists sitting there, and ask them which dishes taste better! This is where you can get freshly bottled Makgoli, which you can't usually find in the convenience stores. Request for the brand that has a thumbs up logo on it."
200,4.0,"It's an amazing place to go when you are in Seoul, you can shop for souvenirs for cheap price,And eat an amazing food. Try the bibimbap, kimbab and the bin dae dduck."
201,4.0,Nice place with great food. I had Topoki and sushi. I think it is a good thing to have on your Seoul todo list.
202,5.0,"Perfect place to taste authentic Korean food from vendors specializing in particular menus. You can eat, drink (soju or Makgeolli) and relax watching crowd going by. You can feel Korea there.I tried kal-mandukuk in vendor No 13 and mandu in vendor No 70. Both just great."
203,5.0,"You will only see only stall that sell street foods. Not only Seoul foods but also another place's food you can find here, such as bibimbap from Jeonju and hotteok from Busan.If you are a food lover, this place is worth to visit!"
204,4.0,"NICE, culturally different, and hard to navigate, but its not a bad place to experience. Plus, the food there is not that bad. Its cheap and affordable if you are into Korean street foods."
205,5.0,"lots of shop in here and it's very famous because of some TV station broadcast about this place.well known as traditional market which sell various things and cheap, such us sandals, fruits, food,cooking ingredientsi visited this market because i wanted to try cheap and delicious food and snack.the shop seller will call you friendly. they will know you tourist vibe then communicate using broken English.. hahaha.. but, it's ok, we still understood and fortunately one of my friend can speak Korean a little bit. i picked the shop randomly because for me all looks the same. we bought a set of tteokbokki, kimbab, omuk, japchae and we payed around 10.000 won. i also tried patbingsoo and payed 4000 won. for me, all are delicious.."
206,4.0,"If you want to have that authenticity feel of letting yourself get bedazzled on how it is to live like a Korean even just for the aspect of getting a snack (maybe after work, school, or for whatever reason) at a local market, then this is a MUST. Delicious foods are lined up which is a feast for your eyes due to their vibrant color, nose due to the enticing aromatic scent of the street foods, and ears due to the noisy but comforting calling of the food stall owners (even if you don't speak Korean).After scouting the whole place, we settled around the middle of the market wherein one of the food stall had many guests lined up. Yup, it's up to our instincts! (though there were posts or pictures wherein they were featured in SBS or KBS ~ I think, if my memory serves me well). Nonetheless, we were happy with our choice. As soon as we got seated, one of the lady servers asked us on what we would want to eat (IN KOREAN or CHINESE I think), one my friends tried to converse w/ her in Chinese but her Chinese was well quite rusty, hahaha! then the couple sitting beside us in the long table helped us, they spoke to us in English and then translated back in Korean to the lady server, they even offered us their wine, Chamisul. It tasted really good!As soon as the food arrived, yep, we were in authenticity heaven! :)) the food was really great and the feel of the local market made it even more savory for me and my friends. Awesome experience! a must visit place! :)"
207,3.0,"If you want to try local food, you should visit this place. For me, I just walked around for 5 minutes only. A bit overrated."
208,5.0,"This market is a must...bindaeduk is the pancake of Seoul...delicious and fresh...they grind the beans, mix with various vegetables or meats and fry...crispy, tasty goodness.  The market also has a costume store...you can look like a Queen, King, Scholar...bride, musician...wear one of those huge braided wigs etc.  Lots of fun to go thru this tiny shop at one end of the main market.  There is raw meat alley....Koreans have their own version of steak tartare and it is delicious.  You can see foods for memorial services, crabs pickled in soyu, herbs, etc. all in one market filled with more locals than tourists."
209,4.0,"The market is large, and there are a lot to see, like hanbok (Korean traditional clothes), souvenirs, the main thing is of course food. There are a lot of small restaurants and stalls serving Korean hotpot, raw fish, snacks, etc at cheap price.  There are a lot of stalls selling mung bean pancakes. Try to find those that are making and frying the pancakes freshly. (And even better, look for the crowded stalls). My friend and I ordered a mung bean pancake, really cheap (1 pancake costed around US$4) and really good and big (we were quite full after sharing 1 pancake)."
210,4.0,"Gwangjang Market is simply a food heaven!! I went during dinner time and most shops were closed and that's when the food trucks/stalls comes up. Many locals dine there too, mainly because the food was really good and it's relatively affordable. All the authentic Korean food can be found there! Do note that the area is cramp and with limited seating space, so it can be quite rushing if it gets crowded.To look at what I had, visit http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/03/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-2.html"
211,4.0,"You have to check out Gwangjang Market for some amazing Korean foods. I only go here for the food market so I can't say much for shopping or anything else. It's a huge market so if you're a first timer, the size and the crowd can be a little intimidating. But no worries, most food vendors are used to tourists and several will try to sway you to eat at their stall. There are tons and tons of food stalls where you can get your grub on and I would say figure out what exactly are you craving for and just go for the stall that has an empty spot for you. If there's more than 3 of you, this can get pretty difficult especially if you come at a time when there's so many people. Not a lot of the vendors speak English but body language and pointing is enough to get you what you want. So once you point to what you want, just sit down and attack just like all the locals around you. Water (or barley tea) is free so you can just ask the food vendor (usually an ahjumma). It's definitely an experience especially if you feel like being adventurous with your cuisine. So have at it, they got bindaeddeok (sorry if it's misspelled but this is a grainier, thicker cousin of the pajeon, a Korean pancake), soondae (pork blood sausage, I loooove the soondae here!), pig trotters, sashimi, fried fish, fried everything else, meat skewers, made-to-order bibimbap (which I will try next time before I've stuffed myself silly with everything else), etc. Maybe get a bottle of makkeolli or soju to wash all the good stuff down. I just made myself extremely hungry now."
212,3.0,"We had dinner here on our first night.  The locals eat here.  I don't think none of the vendors speak English, so you just point to the food that looks good and be bold to try.  Better yet, see where the locals line up and if you have time, go to the end of the line.  We ate a delicious sweet pancake called hoddeok."
213,3.0,"My intention was to get a Hanbuk. If you're thinking of getting one too, do bring a local with you. Easier for you to bargain and ask for the right design.The shop I went, the HanBuk on average cost around 120k won but it is out of my budget . After telling her my budget, she took out a few design which cost around 70k. In the end, i paid 60k won and she said that's the lowest price in town.Apart from the traditional clothes, there were queues everywhere. It was a Sunday , so I guess it is normal to be crowded. For those who can't handle spicy food , you may think twice before trying the pancakes , others like the pork intestines or kimbab are fine."
214,5.0,"If you want cloth, this is the place to be. Plus the surrounding area has half a dozen other types of markets which are fun to explore. The street foods available here were not that exotic or unique, but we did have some great ground kimchi dumplings and some decent breakfast noodles. If you wanted to get a Honbok (spelling?) made in Korea, this would be a phenomenal place to go. There is such a huge selection, however, that I would highly recommend bringing someone local who can bargain or explain what you want."

Went directly to Gwangjang Market and arrived at a personal Shangri-La, with so many different types of food, cooked fresh and available to eat right then and there, which is exactly what I did, in large quantities and with much gusto.Come here for dumplings, bean curd dipped in broth (no idea what this was called in Korean), okonomiyaki style pancakes (ohh yes), kimchis of all shapes and sizes, yukhoe (by exit 2 of the market, turn left and go down the alley between two pharmacies to get this awesome beef tartare dish with asian pear), gimbap, and much more.  I would love to go here every day for the rest of my life.They also sell other stuff that isn't edible but I wasn't interested in that."
216,4.0,"Had our first dinner at Gwangjang Market in Seoul before heading for midnight shopping at Dongdaemun. It's a great local experience as we sat together with the local Koreans to have our meals. We were spoilt from choices as they've a huge selection of authentic Korean food. We had rice cakes (tteokbooki), potato pancake, Japchae (Stir-fried Vermicelli) & a bowl of hot kimchi dumping noodles in the cold weather. It's just awesome!The price are reasonable and you get to experience the local dining culture. Everyone should go at least once! You can read more on my trip & my dining experience at Gwangjang Market here, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/06/seoul-korea-day-2.htmlThanks! Have fun xx."
217,3.0,"I went the for mayak kimbap. Store 12's owner was such a sweet lady and she has prices placed at the stores so you will not be worried about getting ripped off. However, this visit, I was early and she was not opened, so we decided to try something else. BAD. CHOICE. We went to the store facing the famous bindaeddeok street cart (not the shop) (you will see a long queue at the cart). That store was quite long compared to those single-manned carts/stores with 3 ajuma-s working inside. They sold sundae and jokbal and kimbap and tteokbogi. No price was named. First mistake. Second mistake was to not confirm the portion size. I ordered one portion of a few things. From previous experience, the bill should not go above 15,000won. However, the lady charged us 22,000won and chased us away when we asked her about it! Third mistake. Never go to stores that taut. Means they are no good and there to rip you off!! The bindaddeok from the famous stall was great. there was a long queue but it was efficient and we didn't wait long before the pipping hot goodness was in out mouths!! Also, try the raw beef in the yukhoe alley there! It is really fresh and delicious! You'll see tables of ajuma frantically slicing the fresh beef on the spot. No frozen meat!"
218,4.0,"MUST eat Bindaedeok (Mung bean pancake) ... spicy chicken feet is awesome too.Walk along the stretch of food stalls and u'll see a shop selling seaweed, drinks and snacks. This Ahjumma sells even cheaper then Namdaemuen.there's a vintage clothes section on the 2nd flr but its a little messy...Things you can find there::- Traditional Korean Wedding Stuff (no trying thou)- Hanboks- Fresh Seafood- Textile/ Cloth- Vintage clothes- Loads of local food"
219,4.0,Don't miss this place if u want to find Korean silks and brooches. The prices is not expensive.. will be coming back.. So much to see hear...
220,5.0,"It's good to come here to experience seoul's morning market. It's a really big market which was sectioned accordingly, food, textile, clothes, kitchenware, etc....You can try out all sort of korean snacks over here at a reasonable price. In addition, we manage to find a souvenir shop which is selling cheaper than namdaemun.So, highly recommended!!!"
221,4.0,If you like to get a little outside of the tourist comfort zone box this is a good spot.  It is a market with a variety of goods to buy (raw materials as well as clothing etc).  There are also street food vendors that serve up tasty treats!  (caution if you have food allergies - menus will not have much is any English description; we did the point and nod to get ours).  You might not come away with many purchases for things to take home but the experience is very worth it.
222,4.0,"It is unique place you can taste something Korean. Pa-Jun, Sun-Dae, O-Deng,.. many unique Asian food with very cheap price available all around in the market. You drop by station line #1 Jong-Lo-5Ga gate 8, few step from the gate straight and turn left. Whenever I have my visitor in Seoul, I bring them here and have Korean tradition alcohol Mak-Gul-Li with Pa-Jun together. None of them dis-like this lovely place."
223,4.0,"Traditional Korean food on offer, albeit it is all market style.You may have to sit outdoors,  on wooden planks, but it's still all a part of the experience. Gotta go atleast once. That may be enough though. haha"
224,4.0,"We visited this market as part of a tour we recently did and quite enjoyed our brief visit. We visited on a Sunday, so some of the vendors were closed, but the place was still a hive of activity. This market has a bit of everything from shoes to clothes to food to traditional wedding gifts.  It's clearly a hot spot for local dining with the seats at all the food stalls packed with hungry people.Go to check out the local scene.  It's not touristy at all (save for all the tourists checking it out).  You can get a good feel for it in 30 minutes or so, but it is quite large and you could easily lose track of time taking in all the sights."
225,5.0,"Owing to protective trade policy, Korea has the highest food price in all OECD countries.  Some fancy restaurants, of western or Korean cuisine alike, serve amature overpriced dishes. Thus you start developing hunger for hearty food.  As one can read in the restaurant reviews at Tripadvisor, some good restaurants in Seoul cater to economically minded cosmopolitans. There are well priced Korean restaurants hidden in back alleys. Neither of these two are really easily accessible to short-term travelers. Here is a good exception: Gwanjang Market. It used to be for poor people and be not so hygienic. However, with economic development and the consequent elevation of public health, it is loved by all classes of Koreans.  It is close to a subway station Jongro 5 Ga, and, literally, is widely open to everybody. It has a long history, and a good reputation.  Many food stalls have been there for a very long time.  A great fun place to look around and to see what kind of snacks Koreans love to eat:  Duk-bok-gi, Soon-dae, Hue or sashimi, Noodles, etc.  There are many to try. A first-time and thus timid traveller can start with the ""Soon Hee Ne""(a common name of a Korean girl; meaning a friendly sister) Bin-dae-duk (meaning pancake).  Order Bindaeduk ($4) and Gogi Wanja(flattened meat balls; $5) along with Mag-gol-ri or rice wine. It will make you forget about all your hunger for hearty food since your arrival in Seoul.  Do not be confused between market food, like this, and street stall food elsewhere, which would not give any warrantee for hygiene."
226,4.0,"Was surprised by the size of the market initially. Cannot do a full review as I came on a Sunday and many of the stores were CLOSED! =( But was still happy to know that the food stores were open. Many traditional looking Korea food here, and all inexpensive. Will definitely want to come back again."
227,5.0,"As a traditional market that you would go to in order to buy stuff, this particular market specializes in clothing, whole cloth, traditional Korean clothing, tailors, shoes, blankets and bedding, etc.  We saw a whole lot of stuff like that, in any event.  But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience.  The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people.  There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place.  They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly.  All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets.  I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes.  I will be going back so that if I see him again I can buy his meal the next time, as we agreed."
228,3.0,"I was looking for korean silk, korean cotton and korean linen - having read about them, supposedly cheaper than back home. There were many sorts of materials here but you'd better know how silk, cotton, or linen look and feel like before you make your purchase. The sellers said yes to any that you asked, ""is this silk?"" was my most common question since I know my cotton and linen pretty well. Fortunately, I came across some countrywomen who happened to shop for silk in a particular store which really had his walls lines up with korean silk - price wise I'm not sure cheaper than those back home, but you would be spoiled for choice. Glad I bought some. If you have a few hours to spare for shopping here, you could get some good bargains on cotton, which I did."
229,5.0,"Especially at night, after many of markets closed,You can eat very yummy Korean food with reasonable price.Try 'raw beef', and 'Nokdu-jun(green gram pancake)'with traditional drink 'Makgoelli'It's amazing."
