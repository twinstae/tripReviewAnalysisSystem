Set in an historical building, the Korea House is serving an extensive set menu made of several dishes and kimchi (make sure you are hungry because this is like a fest). The show is nice, some acts are really well made."

2,3.0,The show:  5/5The food: 2/5Our party had dinner here prior to the show.  The show was excellent --- all the drumming and dancing were great.  But the food was rather poor.
3,5.0,"What an amazing evening!  The whole show transcends the language barrier to deliver an artful mix of technology, dance, comedy, music, and live theatre.   The play was delightful with a feel good ending.  The dinner we had later was very good and the service impeccable.  This was well worth the time and money to see"
4,5.0,"I am not sure about the food, since it suppose to be authentic. It appeared to me old fashioned and simple. Pretty much the characteristic you find in most traditional cuisines. But that might be the reason for some bad remarks on the food. Nevertheless to me quality was good and the experience was very interesting. The Sim Cheong theater was just amazing. Nowadays entertainment is difficult, because we are just to huge ensembles and perfect performance like in those shows of international scale (Blue Man Group, Riverdance or any given musical). The performance of Sim Cheong is on an enjoyable level. But above all of this I felt the heart of the ensemble. They enjoyed what they did and they were able to pass it on to the audience. Go there and open yourself to the spirit and feel the enthusiasm and the joy and the pride of the actors."
5,2.0,"I was recently here for a business function. Our fairly large group had dinner prior to viewing the theatrical show. We had the traditional multi course Korean dinner. I couldn't tell you what the courses were, but they included various appetizers and mains. Not a single one was good. A couple were edible. I was so turned off by the food that I didn't try the dessert. Unlike the food, the show was decent. It's in a small theater and features musicians, dancers and actors. If I had to describe it I would say it was akin to a non-verbal broadway show but obviously with Korean instruments, music, and dances. It was pretty good and something different to see.Having said that, I wouldn't go back or take anyone who hasn't seen it. It just wasn't worth it. I wish I hadn't  had to waste a meal here."
6,3.0,"Attended a reception in this place.  It is a beautiful setting with lovely traditional architecture.  I love the courtyard with lanterns.  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre and a lot of the dishes tasted the same.  It was a buffet that night with many dishes but none of them was impressive.  There was no show that night.  I might go back for the show but not the food."

I was treated to a good traditional meal and then the real surprise....traditional performing art this was excellent especially the drum dance finale.  Go there..."
8,3.0,"The traditional dance and music which greet you at a Korea House performance are professional and beautifully choreographed. But if you have had a good dinner and then go to this performance, it is not difficult to fall asleep, not even the traditional drums will stop you. Thankfully, there is no attempt to drag the audience onto the stage, so you are safe even if you get a seat in the front row."
