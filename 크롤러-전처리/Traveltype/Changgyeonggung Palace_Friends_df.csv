0,5.0,"Nice place to go for a walk while admiring the beautiful ancient structures in the grounds.  Depending on the time of your visit, there are pocket gardens that can be in full bloom."
1,5.0,"Changgyeonggung is smaller compare to changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung, but it has its own beauty. It is especially beautiful when it rains. If you are looking for peaceful place with less people, Changgyeonggung is the right place. Garden is so beautiful!!"
2,5.0,This palace is not as big as others but the different buildings are so aesthetic and outstanding. From the hill the view is stunning.
3,5.0,"Beautiful!!!! A quiet place, with a lot of history, where you can breathe a lot of peace, it has many typical constructions inside, a lake, a glass greenhouse very nice, it is worth visiting it!!! It is the 2nd place in the palaces of Seoul I liked the most!!"
4,4.0,Seoul has quite a few palaces. Together with Changdeokgung this is the quieter one. From the backgate of Changdeokgung you walk seamlessy into Changgyeonggung. Because this palace was turned into a zoo during the Japanese occupation it has more open spaces.
5,5.0,The palace is serene and not too many people came here when I was there. I visited it after Changdeokgung Palace and I think it's beautiful. You've to come here from the inside of Changdeokgung Palace because the path have beautiful scenery. And don't forget to visit the lake inside and also the green house
6,5.0,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung and Changgyeonggung you  shoud visit for sure
7,5.0,I still can't believe that I managed to get there. It is so great to experience and worth my time and money. I will absolutely go there for the photoshoot next time. I am so in love with their culture. The entire palace was so big and above my expectation. Great experience and it is the best way to learn about their history.
8,5.0,"Beautiful grounds and a really nice escape from the city. Hard to believe it's only 1,000 KRW to get in.  Not as touristy as the other palaces that I went too but very tranquil. Spent several hours walking around and just enjoying watching all the people dressed up."
9,3.0,Personally I will not visit if I was there on my own as it is not a preserved of the original palace but a re-built.
10,4.0,We went here as part of the essential Seoul full day tour. The palace is well maintained. Watch the change of guards at 10 am.
11,4.0,"Wanted to visit the palace as it was where Prince Sado was murdered by his father who made him climb into a rice casket where he was locked and starved to death over 8 days. His son who became King Jeongjo, one of the most revered in Joseon dynasty, moved his father's remains to hills near Suwon and built the Hwaseong fortress. We went on an English guided tour with a friend and the guide was really good. There were hardly any other people in the tour so it was almost like a private tour. The guide explained how the palace was different as it was built for Queens rather than Kings so the inner spaces occupied a larger part of the complex. She also pointed out the courtyard where Prince Sado died in the rice casket and explained that King Jeongjo is the 2nd most beloved monarch after King Sejong who created the Hangul. The palace is right next to Changdeokgung as they used to be one palace, so worth visiting at the same time as the other palace. Defo worth a visit!!"
12,5.0,When we got there we bought the palaces ticket. So excited to see our first palace. Good for those who appreciate architecture and history.
13,5.0,"In the middle of busy city, this palace was so lovely inside and out. A very quite place to visit if you want some time for yourself."
14,4.0,"Entered from the back through the entrance to Changdeokgung. We didn't have to pay an entry fee since we had the Discover Seoul pass.The palace area is smaller than both Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. The buildings were similar to the ones in Gyeongbokgung as it wasn't as colourful as the ones in Changdeokgung. Although not as grand as the other two, I thought that the buildings here were laid out better, particularly the area near the palace itself since they were close by and felt like the whole area was connected.It did feel a little sameish because this was the third palace we had visited in the day."
15,5.0,This Palace is very close to King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin's Monument. And this Palace's Guards show is so amazing!
16,5.0,"This palace is a wonderful place to spend the day. The beautiful forest and walking trails lead you up to the Secret Garden, which is a greenhouse converted into a display of native plants and flowers. There are beautiful ponds with ducks, shaded walking trails and gorgeous architecture. Definitely a place to pack some snacks or a lunch and plenty of water, and wear comfortable walking shoes!"
17,5.0,You get a definite sense of the Korean people's history and feeling for how they lived and functioned over the centuries.
18,4.0,"Changgyeonggung palace was the last palace my sister ticked off our list.First off we should have bought the combination ticket which only costs 10000 krw to visit all the palaces, including Jongmyo shrine (would have saved us 4000krw). In hindsight, we didn't do as much research as we would or we would've discovered this earlier on.We were tired and expected little of Changgyeonggung palace (after 4 palaces,  we expected this one to be pretty much the same) Colour theme of the palaces were pretty similar, however we notes that this palace is notably a lot more romantic. We would've loved to bring our partners here! Long windy trails that goes in different directions; newlyweds taking photos in their wedding hanbok; a bench situated quite nicely facing the frozen lake with a view. These are just namely few locations we love and we don't carry a romantic bone in our bodies at all! As an added touch, the greenhouse was open (as we expected this to may still be closed for repairs or renovation) We feel rejuvenated and re inspired after our visit. It was all worth It! Fortunately for us, we were quite fast walkers and despite us loitering here and there quite a bit for picture ops and also admiring the beauty of the scenery, we spent almost 1.5 hours there. For others that may not be too much into architecture, trail walks or romance then it may take you 1 hour or less."
19,5.0,"Wonderful example of a Korean palace that is easily accessible, inexpensive to visit, with a changing of the guards and guided tours. Lovely gift shop inside and many corners for great photos. A glimpse into imperial life."
20,4.0,"As the palaces are close to each other, it is highly recommended to buy the package to see them all and take a stroll of the past!"
21,5.0,"Beautiful, quiet space. One of the less busy palaces, you can see a lot of remarkable architectural feats and designs without the foot traffic familiar to other, larger palaces. Cheap entry - well worth checking out the secret garden too!"
22,5.0,They have a change of guards on the top of every hour. It is a beautiful palace with interesting history. You should rent a hambok and go and take pictures.
23,5.0,Great place to see the history of Korea - great time of the Josun Dynasty and sad time of the Josun Dynasty - the last King and his wife of the Josen Dynasty.
24,3.0,"Went to 2 of the palaces nearby in our Hanboks (you get free entry if you're wearing a Hanbok) and they both look the same with huge ceilings, a backyard and bare halls/walkways around the place. Not too bad a place for some photo-taking with the hanbok, but not much activities to do as it's quite empty."
25,3.0,A visit to the palace whilst in Seoul is a must.The park is very nice and well kept. The street of remembrance is a reconstruction of a Seoul strrt of the '70s. It is nice but somewhat cold. I would have make more lively with actual coffee served and the like.The entrance to the palace grounds comes at a price (2000). Worth paying it. Everything (or most of it) is a reconstruction therefore there is the need to read carefully the explanations to understand. Overall nice but not overwhelming
26,5.0,One of the biggest temples around Seoul. Close to Anguk station. Rich piece of history worth of visiting.
27,5.0,"My friends and I had joined the Huwon English tour (cost me 8,000 won in total). The participants of the tour seems not restricted to number of people per tour, so it might get a little packed. The Huwon (secret garden) is impressive with palace, lakes and leaves which makes me feel peace. Preferred to join tour while walking around the palace if you like history stuff because without the explanation you may feel lost and all palace may looks same to you."
28,4.0,Typical Korean royal architecture to see here. It is a large and wide area to spend more than two hours. The change of guards in the morning and then the inside area with other buildings are really worth visiting to get a feel of royal korean culture.
29,5.0,"This was my first time to visit this palace in Korea.  It was a guided English speaking tour.  The tour guide was speaks very good english and very knowledgeable of the palace history.  Unbelieavable place to see most of the original building and things inside the palace.  Our tour company made the reservations for the guided tour and they informed us that its difficult to get in.  Compared to the other palaces in Korea, I believe this is the best one.  The secret garden tour is after the palace tour.  The garden tour is also nice but a lot of iphill and downhill walking so bring good walking shoes during this tour."
30,4.0,"This palace is located near Gwanghamun Square and its entrance fee is 3,000. The garden, lake and palace makes such a picturesque scene."
31,4.0,"Several palaces in Seoul. The most evisited is Gyeongbokung and the Secret Garden in Changdeokgung. I visited Changgeonggung quite long time ago, but much less times than the other two. Comapre to Gyeongbok or Secret Garden in Changdeok, it is less various things to look around however, very quite, tranquille, peaceful place. I like the pond(Chundangji) and its octangonal stone pagoda. Good to take a walk around feeling serenity. Thesedays, there is special exhibition of King Jeongjo(ruling Dinasty from1777-1800).It was amazing to watch King's own writing in old Korean which is still readible and understandable even for me, contemporary human being, who live now! He was such a good king and talenated for the arts too!!  If you like quiet place from the busy city life, pls try to visit here. This palace is linked to Chengdeokgung in the middle, so you can enter that palace, paying the ticket there."
32,5.0,"I visited this palace with friends, very intersesting with map and translator,,,wouaou~~ì recommend/kam-sam-dah"
33,4.0,"Changgyeonggung Palace(s)  The name is hard for me to pronounce correctly the way Koreans say it.Entrance fee is around $12, but free for seniors. The compound is so vast that you should prepare for a bit of walking and get an umbrella if it is a rainy day to enjoy the surroundings."
34,4.0,"Very interesting Palace, enjoyed the tour guides commentaries. Interesting to note the statues on the roofs.  Background info on the cultural aspects of the life of queen, how the king and queen lived in separate households, the ratio of servants/staff to the Royal Family was staggering"
35,5.0,"I went there last week on Children's Day and they had a performance of several actors who played the royal family and their guards and servants, it was so nuch fun to watch! We then walked around the palace area and there's a gorgeous lake, too. It was great weather and not even that crowded. A must-go."
36,5.0,"The official Seoul turist map suggests that the entrance to this Palace is on the south-west corner of the park. However once you go through the main gate you end up in the other Palace. You can get between the palaces without exiting the park but if you don't know which palace you're in it's much harder to navigate. Palace itself is nice but not as good as the other one. I would not make it my priority. The ""G"" Palace is much nicer so go there i stead if you have limitted time."
37,4.0,Changgyeonggung Palace and its secret garden is well worth a visit. English speaking tours take place several times a day. We had a lovely guide who brought the palace to life. It's worth noting  cannot enter the secret garden unaccompanied so must book a tour for this part.
38,3.0,This is a smaller palace compared to others.  But still it has its own hidden history. Otherwise nice architecture.
39,5.0,Changgyeonggung Palace has a lot of backstory indicated on the plates per room on the whole yard. This makes walking and looking at the rooms a more fulfilling as you know its value as a historical site.
40,4.0,You much visit all palaces in Seoul. Palaces are must watch. The structure and the piece of art is something that you will admire. It is very peaceful place.
41,4.0,When I went I got to see the changing of the guard ceremony. It was very epic and took about 15-20 mins to complete. Got some cool photos and videos. The guard where traditional ceremonial warrior garb and stand motionless and still out in front of the entrance to the palace. It's pretty cool that they still carry the tradition. The palace is very impressive. It's so big you can barely take a picture of it. Definitely check it out.
42,5.0,"This was by far my favourite of the main palaces in Seoul. It feels a   bit hidden away from the main temples and as a result was much quieter than the others. Like all other temples in the area, this one has been extremely well restored"
43,4.0,"A good place to visit and to learn more about Korean history. excellent tour guides and they can introduce you in English, Chinese, Japanese."
44,5.0,"We took an English tour, which was very professional, interesting  and educational.There are a lot of beautiful structures. I realized that one palace complex is probably plenty.So if you already seen Main palace, you can skip this one or vice versa."
45,4.0,"Originally built as living quarters, especially for dowager queens, rather than as a throne hall, while not as huge as the rest of the 4 palaces, this place is definitely huge and worth a visit for its rich history, its stunning and peaceful parks. Right in the city centre. One of my favourite palaces.  Do remember to visit the nearby Changdeokgung Palace as both palaces were known to be the East Palaces. Both palaces shared the same rear garden."
46,5.0,And you've seen them all. The architectural design is not way too different from the palaces and temples of Seoul's next door neighbors. Go for the changing of the guards. This is always awesome to watch!
47,5.0,this palace is sort of attached to to Changdeokgung and i hadn't even realized when i had gone from one to the other but it was all really beautiful.
48,5.0,Beautiful colors shining in the sunlight and fascinating stories of times gone by.  A must see if you are in Seoul
49,4.0,"like the other palaces of Seoul, this is a great place to learn about the culture/history of Korea. Personally I think this was the best palace we had visited because the nature walk here was really long and very pleasant"
50,4.0,"The palace buildings are nothing special compared to the other palaces that you can visit in Seoul, including Changdeokgung next door.  The highlight for me is the early 20th century greenhouse, which is a beautiful structure in its own right and worth the admission price.  The plants are nice, too."
51,2.0,"You think that you need a reservation to visit the Secret Garden, since it claim it only takes 50 people. However this is not true. When we visit it there were over 150 people with one guide. They claim it is a Secret Garden, it is not. It is the Palace ground that required a 3 mile hike, some of it steep grade. Totally not worth it. A complete waste of time and monies. A garden have a meaning of flowers, good luck finding one."
52,5.0,"A very beautiful palace and palace grounds. Had a very lovely walk in the August heat, where we checked out the palace itself and then had a nice stroll throughout the park grounds. It is not as impressive as other palaces might be, but it is wonderful to look at either way."
53,4.0,Probably one of the least impressive Palaces in Seoul so if on very limited time make sure you see Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung first.  Saying that it is beautiful and time allowing is a must see.
54,3.0,it's very touristy and i am sorry i feel that everything was surreal.this palace is a part of a very big palace complex which we didn't gone to cover it...for some reason we didnt' get the information of the history of the palace and what's conclude. so if the tourism of Korea could give me more knowledge of the palace i could have appreciate it more.
55,4.0,you can literally walk into the place though the back-gate of Changduk-palace. But still need to buy the ticket.
56,4.0,"This palace is much smaller, but the scenery is beautiful when you visit during Autumn. There are many photogenic spot you can find and to take gorgeous pictures."
57,4.0,"Massive area to cover, but overall all the buildings are relatively the same. You can't go inside, only look from outside. In winter it gets cold doing such activity. Nonetheless worth going to. Not like indoor palaces of England or Turkey."
58,5.0,"It was amazing with the beautiful landscape and wonderful well kept history structures. You can also get storytellings about the palace. I visited there in summer, it was really cool and impressive."
59,5.0,Always love the chance to get back to the history of Korea and its' people and rulers. The change of pace is also a welcome relief from the over hurried reality of life in modern Korean society south of the 38th Parallel. Go. Enjoy!
60,4.0,The architecture and the whole surrounding is definitely advantageous but far from that the history to the place makes it even more interesting. It would be nice to join yourself in a guided tour to know the history and the exhibits and the various parts of this vast palace. Its definitely much more peaceful and beautiful than the others.
61,3.0,one of the palaces in the area. nice for photography. lots of people visiting the place. nice in autumn
62,4.0,"On autumn, there are so many position with beautyfull landscape to take for photographers.But in the secret garden, we must join the group with tour guide. So there are so many people with photographers for landscape!"
63,5.0,"My friends and I toured several palaces in Seoul. This, like the others, is phenomenal!  Whether you're an architecture buff or not, you'll appreciate the absolute beauty."
64,4.0,This is my 3rd favorite palace out of the integrated palaces. I visited this place when it was snowing and the scenery is really outstanding.
