0,5.0,"Just had 1 day and took the train from Main Station out to the Olympic Park, about 2 hours. Great value for the service, there are 1st class cars available. You get a snack and bottle of water, extra cushy seats adn more leg room. I was suprised no QR code check to get to the car - honor system, but ticket was scanned on board. They even have an option to charge people if you dont have a ticket. I would use this again if needing to get around the country."
