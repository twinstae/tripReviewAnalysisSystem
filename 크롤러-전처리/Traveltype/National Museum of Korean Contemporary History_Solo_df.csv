0,2.0,"I’m sorry, first and foremost that the best efforts of designers and planners and curators were insufficient in my opinion.  I’m also sorry that I don’t agree with other reviewers who gave it high grades causing me to visit.Let’s start with the most important thing:  the exhibits themselves.  Imagine, if you will, about 3 pages single spaced of text.  Now take a scissor and  cut it into strips horizontally.  Now paste one of these strips on each exhibit window.  There, you’ve got the text.  Now fill the space behind each window with a few old documents and some photos that were found or donated.  And now you have the essence of the museum.Second, for English speakers(and most people reading TripAdvisor are, I believe, English speakers), it is clear that not all of the text is being translated.  For example, 6 lines of Korean text is translated to 5 words in English.  Some of the videos do not have English subtitles.  At the main entrance to the building in which the museum is located, from the street you cannot tell that the museum is inside.  Only when you see it on the panels of the revolving door do you know that you are in the right place.  True, on the side street, the door is labeled clearly, but I suspect that I was not the only visitor who came on the main street from the line 5 subway station.And finally, the museum is undergoing some kind of renovation so that of three exhibition halls, only two are operative until DecemberIf you happen to be passing by, then you might choose to give it a try.  There is no entrance fee.  However if you have to make an effort to visit, give it a pass."
1,4.0,"The museum is modern, clean and very informative, although the information feels a little bit on the bright side. The view from the rooftop garden is perfect for seeing the castle and cathing the city's vibe."
2,4.0,This museum is very close to the main palace and free to visit. It teaches you about how fast S. Korea improved after the Korean War and you can see several Korean vehicles displayed along with household and electronic goods. Not as fun as the Seoul history museum but still enjoyable. The gift shop is worth checking out as well for some good souvenirs (shop around several places and do your buying on the last day).
3,4.0,I'm a sucker for history museums. This was my last history museum during my trip to Seoul. I'm glad I came here last as it was the culmination from the past to present. I have such pride in S. Korea for the fact that they overcame so much where they are now.
4,3.0,"For those foreigners who have studied Korean history from outside of Korea, you will find this museum to be a fantasy view of Koreans as to how they wish contemporary history might have been. Except, obviously, for the painful parts where Korea was occupied by Japan. The museum is long on what Koreans did to fight the Japanese during the occupation and short on what other countries did to actually free Korea from their Japanese oppressors. Overall an enjoyable two hour visit. And I was most impressed that the museum Curator was greeting guests upon their arrival. The exhibits are well done. The facilities are modern and clean."
5,5.0,"The museum occupies 3 floors. It is conveniently located almost across from Gwanghwamun Gate.The exhibition covers the recent history, mainly the 20th century. It is well and logically presented, with good lighting and proper signage with enough English. It is easy to navigate. I didn't know much about the Japanese occupation before my visit, I gathered a great info on the subject. I was also not aware of the sheer size of Korean shipping building industry - the museum has a great display covering it. There is the observation desk on the top floor, a couple of my attached photos was taken there. It is a great viewing point. The museum has a shop inside, escalators to move between floors. As all the museums that I visited in Seoul, it is well thought out.I am recommending a visit."
6,5.0,This museum shows the 20th century modern history of Korea.I really recommend it to eveyone.This museum is free. It's located near by the subway.You can see 3section(maybe 4?)of modern Korean history. It takes 1 hour to see everything there.
7,5.0,"This free museum is very close to the palace and if you go to the top floor, there's a great roof garden that overlooks the palace and the surrounding hills for great photos and views. The exhibits tell the story of post war Korea, right up to 2017."
8,4.0,"Centrally located, easily accessible. Museum is well organized with expressions and directing signs in English. Worth visiting to have information on Korean history."
9,4.0,This is a good place for someone who is wants to gain some basic knowledge of 20th century Korean history. I started with an elevator ride up to the 8th floor to the rooftop garden. This provided a great view of the Gyeongbokgung Palace from above the walls adding views of the mountains behind. Very nice security staff member tried very hard to help me with questions given my inability to speak the language. During my visit through the halls a couple of middle school groups made their way through with the expected exuberant behavior of young people freed from the the confines of the school building but in my opinion added to the authenticity of the experience! Worth the time!
10,4.0,"Pretty much tells it like it is without going into too much depth.  Decent presentation s too, with a reasonable amount of text in English. Cafe attached."
11,3.0,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: A museum of modern and contemporary Korean history showcase the late 19th century to now and also Seoul Olympics. The Location: Subway Line 5, Gwangwamum Station, Exit 2"
12,5.0,I thought I knew about Korea but this exhibition was great. Free entry the 4 galeries take you from the ancient emperors to modern day. Plenty of English and lots of of photos. I stayed for far longer than I had planned to and came out much wiser about some of the struggles the Korean people have gone through.
13,5.0,"As I booked a trip to Japan for January 2017, I ended up with a nice layover at South Korea's Incheon Airport, long enough to let me head into Seoul for a few hours. Having previously called Seoul home, I wanted to pick a good sight as a refresher, and with the ongoing political scandal of President Park Geun-hye, I decided that visiting this museum, which deals with the series of events that led to the rise of both Park and her late father Park Chung-hee among others, was the right thing to do.- Overview -While most people tend to think of the old Korea from the royal dynasties, or the modern pop culture, not many people know or understand the Korea in between - the age of modernization and colonization, the story behind the division, the war, and South Korea's industrialization. This museum fills in the gap, covering the history of Korea from 1876.The museum is located right next to Gwanghwamun, in one of the twin buildings; the other twin building is the United States Embassy. It is easily reached via public transit; use the subway Line 5 (Gwanghwamun Station) for the easiest access, though Line 3 (Anguk Station) and Line 1 (Jonggak Station) also work.Admission is free!There are storage lockers on the second floor before the first exhibition hall; use a 100-won coin as a deposit to release the key, and the coin is returned when I am done with the locker and return the key.- Exhibits -Exhibit 1 on the second floor is primarily about Korea from 1876 to 1945, from learning to conduct diplomacy in a modern way to learning to pick national symbols such as a flag or an anthem. Having been locked into a Confucian diplomatic order for so long, where Korea considered it an obligation to be China's best possible vassal state, there was a steep learning curve ahead. The exhibits go through the opening of relations to non-Chinese states, the declaration of a sovereign empire, the steps that led to Korea becoming a Japanese colony (complete with the treaty documents), and the struggles of Koreans to regain their sovereignty.Exhibit 2, on the third floor, deal with the early troubles of South Korea, 1945-1960. The war was the primary challenge that devastated the nation, so there are exhibits that deal with war rations, American aid packages, and policy treatises of the inaugural Syngman Rhee administration. This section ends with Rhee's fraudulent attempt to win a fourth presidential term, which ended instead with a popular uprising that forced him to resign, complete with the campaign posters and Rhee's resignation letter. There is also an automobile here, in the form of the Shibal, the first South Korean automobile that was little more than cobbled parts of leftover war surplus American jeeps. Additionally, there also are some documents and exhibits that have to do with the other side of the DMZ, with founding documents for the Korean Workers' Party, the eventual rise of Kim Il-sung and the modern-day North Korea, and preparation for its invasion of South Korea.Exhibit 3 and 4 make up the 4th floor. Exhibit 3 runs to about 1990, dealing with South Korea's economic rise and political turmoils. The exhibit starts with the role of the museum's building, which then housed the national planning group of General Park Chung-hee, who had seized power through a 1961 military coup. Posters from the Park military government with anticommunist propaganda and work campaigns abound here, increasing in severity with time. There also are numerous exhibits of Korean manufactured products, showing the development of industries; they start with wigs (wig exports made up 9% of South Korea's economic activity in the late 1960s, and Korean wigs dominated American stores at the time), moving on to simple electronics, and eventually to more complex items like televisions and VCRs. And automobiles: two are here, one being a 1960s Kia 3-wheeled pickup truck based on Mazda design, and the other a 1970s Hyundai Pony that was Korea's first indigenous car. (Being a car buff myself and a Hyundai owner, I came here precisely to take photos of the Pony.) There also are newspaper headlines of key events of the era - such as the assassination of Park Chung-hee in October 1979.Exhibit 4 continues with the development of South Korea into the modern era, with the final ending of military dictatorships in 1987 and the start of democratic elections (complete with the highly contested 1987 presidential election posters), the rise of Korean pop culture internationally, and changing social structures in the form of declining birthrates and the rise of ethnically mixed Koreans. There is even a Hall of Presidents with photos of ten historic South Korean Presidents (the eleventh, Park Geun-hye, is not included as this museum was dedicated prior to her inauguration), facing in the direction of Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Presidential Blue House; I loved the view.- In retrospect -Due to my very limited time in Seoul, I had to hurry through the last exhibit hall. I certainly will need to return on a next dedicated Korea visit. But this museum was all that I had imagined it to be, then some. It is a good overview of the development of a country from a nobody into a world power, and a nationalistic brag sheet too; but considering what they have accomplished in the past century, the Koreans do have a right to brag. I also appreciated that while the museum is from the point of view of the conservative government and primarily reflects its propaganda, there also are strong voices from those who resisted authoritarian rule and made democracy happen - the very ones who often were (and in some cases still are) dismissed as Communist sympathizers.South Korea still has a lot of problems on its hands; the current impeachment proceedings of President Park Geun-hye has exposed rampant corruption, cronyism, and authoritarian mindset that still have not completely gone away. For that matter, Park Geun-hye is the daughter of brutal dictator Park Chung-hee, a hero to the conservatives but a villain to the democracy activists. But South Korea is a country that has been to hell multiple times - and has come back every time stronger than ever. As South Korea continues to build a democratic tradition, there will be many lessons for the world to learn. Perhaps for me too right back home in the United States, where Donald Trump will be my next President and he does not hesitate to belittle, and attempt to humiliate and silence, his critics, in a way too reminiscent of some of the past South Korean leaders. It's time for my fellow Americans, and freedom-loving people of all other nations, to take note and say no to authoritarianism of any kind."
14,4.0,"I walked in simply to escape the heat and do something on my last day - no exceptions always work the best when going into such museums. The exhibition is laid out on three floors and navigation is made very simple. With ease you are shown that Korean history has been rather bumpy and through several changes has become what it is now - looking modern while thinking remains more on the conservative side. You get a pretty good idea why Koreans are study focused and treasure education. The darker periods are addressed and surely there are still several wounds left to heal, something which I could connect with - the displays could be simple yet powerful.Was there a bias in the museum? Honestly there is bias in history in general and we can not change that. Personally I feel like the museum gives a great basis off which to go out and learn more."
15,4.0,"On four levels, a good set of displays with sufficient translation into English. There were a lot of schoolchildren when I visited."
16,5.0,"I did not expect any Korean museum to be even better than the Gogung Museum, but apparently I was wrong. It was an interesting experience visiting here, as I got to view the Korean contemporary history from a Korean point of view. If you've seen how the Chinese government presents the Korean War history, you would know how fascinating it is to do a comparison. Sometimes in order to avoid getting brainwashed by one government, it isn't a bad idea to study propaganda of both sides, and stay neutral."
17,3.0,Many representations of everyday life of Korea is present; not very interesting though you can easily complete the museum around 2 hours
18,4.0,"This museum is conveniently located close to Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeongbokgung Palace in the centre of Seoul. It covers the history of Korea since the late 1800s and tells the fascinating story of how Korea overcame colonialism, war and economic devastation. A large portion of the exhibits are Korean language documents, so are a bit boring for non-Korean speakers, but there is generally a good mix of photos, artifacts and information that give you information on Korean politics, economics, development and culture during the modern era. The highlight is probably the mock Presidential desk in front of a window overlooking the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Well worth a visit."
19,4.0,"Spent about 1.5 hours here; awesome time, free admission, GREAT artifacts, great blurbs for English Speakers on the side of exhibits (but get the headset if you're really into what each little artifact is about). Highly recommend. Gives a great glimpse of the Korea you're visiting. Probably not a little little kid's place – fifth graders and beyond would probably be fine.If you have enough reasoning to see through some things, then this is an awesome museum. Let me first get it out of the way by saying, yes, it's definitely biased – it's not quite propagandic, but it IS biased. For instance, there is a map on one floor that maps out the ""free world"" v. ""communism"", with one other color as the ""whatever"" category. Most of the map was the free world, with the exception of North Korea and Russia, which were marked as communist. True, but I wouldn't exactly call the rest of the globe ""the free world,"" especially with the recent political issues coming up in S.K. That's all I feel like I CAN say, if you feel me.Other parts are redeemed; for instance, one exhibit talks about Korea's rapid economic growth while the next exhibit counters that by saying that there were a lot of protests – workers were treated like crap, and were essentially stepped abused for this economic growth."
