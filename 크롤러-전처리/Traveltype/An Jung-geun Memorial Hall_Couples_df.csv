0,5.0,"This is a very touching museum dedicated to the life of an important Korean martyr who opposed the Japanese rule on the peninsula and ended up killing the Japanese price ruling over Korea. It is a testimony of the struggle of the oppressed people and symbolizes the will of Korea to be free and be ready for anything to reach its independence. I confess that, before visiting this place, I did not know anything about Ahn Jung Geun, but when I got out of the museum I felt quite emotional.  His life is narrated as a story of strong belief and resistance until martyrdom. Many parts and panels are in Korean only, but the friendly lady at the entrance and a man who we met on the second floor were very helpful. In particular he gave us a small book in English about his life and pictures. If you can, add this museum to your list of place to visit in Seoul."
