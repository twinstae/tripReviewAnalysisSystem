0,5.0,"You will find this temple on the way to the Korean Furniture Museum, one of the popular tourist sites. But this is not the place you should just pass by.   When I visited the place was a month before Buddhaâ€™s birthday, so there were many lanterns hanging. The colorful lanterns are for us, living people while the white ones are for the deceased ones. The fun fact about this temple is that this place used to be Yojung, the place where powerful and rich people used to hang around with Kiseng (Korean Geisha) up until late 1980s. The owner of the place later turned this place around and donated it to a Buddhism leader.You should cover yourself if you are wearing a short pant or skirt. They provide some kind of blanket that could cover you."

The temple was founded only recently in 1997 yet we imagined it had been here for much longer.  Entering in through the front gate our eyes were immediately drawn to the rows and rows of colourful lanterns hanging over a large amount of the outside space.  The grounds were very peaceful and relaxing.  The temple offers a range of Buddhist programs, mediation classes and temple stays.  This destination is not near the city centre, the nearest subway station is Hansung University on Line 4, take Exit 6 either walk as we did up hill for twenty minutes or I have read that there is an option to take a bus."
2,3.0,"This temple is located in a strikingly quiet neighbourhood of Seoul and it seems to get very few visitors, at least in winter, so visiting it was a very relaxing experience. The compound includes at least as many modern buildings as traditional ones, which did temper my already limited enthusiasm. The souvenir shop was closed, which makes sense the place being so undersubscribed. They advertise Templestay, so you could spend the night with the monks if that's your thing. As with all traditional Korean architecture as far as I know, you do not go indoors at all -visitors are not allowed anywhere inside, and winter in Seoul being what it is, wearing seriously warm clothing is essential, or even better, time your trip in another season."
