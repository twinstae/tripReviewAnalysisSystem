0,5.0,"This museum is worth a visit both for the amazing building and the collections. The building is grandiose and the exhibition rooms are well designed. Everything is translated into English making it easy to navigate. The collections are remarkable, with the main focus being on Korean art from pre-historical times to early modern history. Easy access by metro. Allow enough time to visit the many interesting rooms."

2,5.0,"Sadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under but no age limit.- free entry to the permanent exhibit- plenty of parking Recommend!"
3,5.0,"If you are into understanding and experiencing the evolution of Art, calligraphy and sculpting, this is a must do.If not, you’d better skip it.Very detailed collections of multiple era’s within the Korean geography. Surprisingly well kept. Especially the calligraphy from stone carving over papyrus to the first printed books.The museum souvenir store is a real gem."
4,4.0,We love to learn about the countries we visit and the museum was a great way to do that. It feels wide open and uncluttered and is easy to get around. The gardens outside are beautiful and not to be missed. We didn’t eat here as it seemed expensive (like all museums) so bring snacks. My 12 year old was bored but my two 18 year olds love it. Have a great day.
5,4.0,Free and worth visiting with Korean Dynasties and cultures.I luv the small cafeteria inside very clean and polite staffs
6,5.0,"The museum is big and has lots of interesting rooms with history of Korea. There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum. I went to the museum on the weekend and I didn't have to pay an entrance fee, I guess the entrance is free on the weekends. You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an X-ray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are. I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge."
7,5.0,We have been to this museum on two seperate visits . it is well done and explains th rich history of Korea. It is easier to understand the culture with a history lesson from the museum.
8,5.0,"Sadly the app crashed and lost my review - good for kids- Timed, free entry for the kids museum, geared for 7 & under- traveling Happy inside exhibit was great!Recommend!"
9,4.0,"Love the exhibits, the architecture and facilities at this museum. Please allocate ample time for this place, and do not skip the park."
10,5.0,If you want to learn about Korea and its extraordinary history go to this Museum. My family and I loved it!Please try the cafe on the ground floor-beautiful!
11,5.0,"Was able to spend two hours here and wished we could have stayed all day. Not only are the exhibits fascinating, but the building itself is very beautiful. The architecture is modern and sleek, but not in a brutalist unfriendly way. The lighting inside the building was amazing, and the fixture are very technologically advanced. One of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited. There is a restaurant and children's museum there as well."
12,4.0,"The National Palace Museum was housed in a massive building and was quite impressive as we walked towards it.  The opening in the center framed a view of Seoul Tower in the distance.Outside in the sprawling park were various ancient lanterns, restaurants, a bell and a large pond.  Inside were three floors of historical artifacts both curated and donated to the museum.  We started on the third floor and worked our way down with the hopes of missing the large groups of school age children that arrived the same time as us.  This worked well for the first hour.  The third floor contained a large variety of Buddhist sculptures and various pieces of art from around Asia.   Half of the second floor was full of donated collections and were a mixture of different eras and countries.  Not that interesting to us.  The other half covered the paintings and an amazing two story tall Buddhist scroll.  Dynasties and even older Korean civilizations were covered in detail on the first floor.  However, as this was a rather large museum we breezed through these displays as we were ready to get outdoors.  Overall, this museum could be split into a 2 day visit to avoid history overload."
13,4.0,"This is a great museum. 1) its free 2) the grounds are beautiful 3) the museum store has very inexpensive and nice museum gifts 4) lockers for your stuff 5) many nice artifacts from Korea and other Asian areas. We did not go to any of the special exhibits as we were a bit short on time, but we had a great visit."
14,3.0,"We were not able to enter the museum because we used up all our time playing outside and around the place. Although the building shouts CONCRETE, the setting is serene with nice pocket spots.  There were pine trees that dropped lots of miniature pine cones that my little granddaughter enjoyed collecting - this is why we ended up staying outside."
15,3.0,"We were told it is one of the best and had pretty high expectations. It was not so systemic as we expected. But at the same time, it gives some overview of Korean culture and history."
16,5.0,"This is a beautiful place to visit when you come to Korea, know more about the culture of this county. Nice to visit"
17,5.0,"The museum with the most heritages in Korea.With amazing flower gardens and huge pond, it's good for a picnic as well as history learning.- As everyone knows, the entrance is free except special exhibitions.- I was surprise to see it opens seven days a week.- The varieties of items weren't as much as I expected. But, it's still huge.- Don't expect much of luxurious and fascinating treasures because former Korean kingdoms have valued something humble. On the other hand, there are delicate and mysterious master-made items. - The location is quite away from popular touristic areas. It's not crowded on weekdays.- Exhibition halls are well-maintained. You can watch most items just by moving forward. And there are quite enough resting areas.- Free lockers, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Souvenir shop is must-visit. There are amazing merchandises.- In April, there were many maehwa(Japanese Apricot flowers) blooming in the garden. It seemed there were more people outdoors than inside. Taking a walk around the building is recommended when it's warm.- To the east, it's connected to Hangul Museum and Yongsan Family Park. Both are good to visit as well."
18,4.0,"This museum is really big, so be prepared to spend a lot amount of time there, especially if you're a museum geek. The collection is really massive and quite complete."
19,5.0,"Even if this imposing museum is filled with exquisite artifacts, the unforgettable displays are set up in a way to be able to really appreciate and enjoy them. There are lots of benches to reflect upon and the explanations are well written. The lockers make it easy to store coats and bags, and there are many easily accessible bathrooms."
20,5.0,"A beautiful and action-packed place to visit.  The main collection is wonderful and free. The rotating exhibits will charge a fee, but they are also first-rate.  Plenty to do for adults and kids. The grounds are also a must-see."
21,5.0,"Show the work rotation, depending on the management of the exhibition Both of Korea And items from other countries borrowed to exhibit The formatting is very interesting. Anyone who likes a museum should not miss it."
22,5.0,Very good feedback and demonstrations of the people of Korea. The museum is clean and tidy. Good attraction to visit.
23,3.0,"Entrance is freeHuge exhibition space with many floorsHowever, most of the descriptions are in Korean"
24,3.0,"This is a place for people who knows how to appreciate historic artefacts - especially artefacts related to buddhism. Otherwise, I do not recommend this on your itinerary. Especially because the exhibits were rather niche. That said, it has a nice and clean environment. There were also 3 levels of exhibition halls."
25,4.0,"As a foreigner, I have been following Korean history. Not through the book but by watching Korean movies. Goreo, Joseon. All make sense via easy arrangement of the exhibition halls. Anti-clockwisely, it explains Korea history from early to modern."
26,5.0,Three story building housing many artifacts that give a full history of Korea from early time.  Reach easily by bus.
27,5.0,"Wonderful museum, can easily spend a lot of time here learning about Korea's history. Signs are in English on the exhibitions and there is a lot to see. The museum is free and also provides free luggage storage and free lockers, great for tourists. There is also a resting area in every few halls to take a break or wait for others in your party to catch up. Would highly recommend a visit here if you are traveling to Korea."
28,5.0,"Being able to learn about the country that I truly admire is one of the greatest feeling and probably achievement. This had made me appreciate more about Korea, its people and culture."
29,5.0,"Done up and managed very well, it is worth a visit for sure. Take your time moving through the exhibits- plan about 3-4 hrs"
30,3.0,"The museum is a fair bits walk uphill from the closes metro station. The giant pagoda inside is incredible. Lots of other cultural possessions inside from China, Mongolia, Rome, Japan to name a few. Very popular spot for schools and you'll see lots of children and their teachers all over. Overall it wasn't as impressive as I thought. The War Museum is a better choice with more ""interaction""."
31,5.0,"Fantastic museum from the outside in, well set out with stories, photos, artefacts and displays. Great start to those wanting more knowledge about Korea’s ancient past."
32,5.0,"The largest museum in Korea, it contains key artefacts that tell the story of the country. There are also educational and cultural assets here meaning there is something for all."
33,5.0,"Loved the museum, so much to see there, lots of information given on this beautiful country, must visit again."
34,5.0,There are plenty of reading materials that they provide in different language as well and it's all for free. They even have these stamp pad that you can roam around and complete as you go along the way. It's amazing seeing them in person as we always see it in the korean tv shows and movies.
35,4.0,We only spent part of a day here.  You need more than a partial day as we did not see a lot of the Museum.  I highly recommend seeing the Budda section.
36,5.0,"Highly recommend!  I would definitely recommend a guide.  There is a lot of amazing content. We hired a personal guide, and it was entirely worth it. The guide drastically amplified the experience. Even if you don’t have a guide, it’s still going to be worth while.  I’d plan on 2 hours per floor. We split it up in 2 days."
37,5.0,This was truly one of the best museums we have ever visited.   Extremely well laid out.   Fascinating.    Took the subway there.   Just a short walk from the stop.  The museum is laid out in chronological order of the history of Korea.    Learnt an awful lot.
38,5.0,"This museum is just beautiful!!!  Huge, well laid out, architecturally stunning.  We took Free English tour.  Since there is so much ground to cover I highly recommend the tour as it highlights some MUST SEES. 90 minutes long it goes quick but provides interesting insights.  Even my 10 year old was enjoying it!"
39,4.0,"A good place to bring high school students to visit the museum. However, no information about the Korean War which we are very interested to know more."
40,5.0,"We enjoyed this peaceful, amazing architecture and all of the many wonders within.  You can see so many different periods of Korean history here.  From the famous ""Turtle Boats"" of the 10th century through the Korean War and beyond.  A balance focus on events and culture.  Really a treat."
41,1.0,"We were so looking forward to seeing Danwon and Hyewon paintings in this museum. It was easy to take matro line 4 to get there. Walking through air conditioned tunnel, we thought it is a great design to avoid the sun light. The museum campus is quite big, well maintained and free admission. We asked front desk where are the paintings displayed. The answer is ""they are in the storage room, not in exhibit. We don't know when they will be shown""."
42,2.0,"There is not much too see compare with other museum in Seoul. Don't think there is value to visit if you have not much time in Korea,"
43,5.0,This massively impressive building in Seoul is home to a lot of South Korea's History. The building is made up of three floors and is spilt into a number of different chambers dependent on time periods of various kingdoms/empires including the Japanese colonisation period. There is however a lot of information so I would recommend either spilting your visit into a number of hours with a break in the middle or possibly a couple of day's. There is also a museum shop with lots of different gifts and also a cafe and a large exhibition/amphitheatre area just outside the building where they play music and perform. And best of all its free and easy to get to by subway or bus.
44,4.0,"This is my 3rd time here and I still enjoy it. However, I note that the exhibits hasn't changed much over the years. We didn't understand the English guide much but because he was so sincere, it would have been terrible to fault him."
45,5.0,"we went to the museum for a visit. we pre registered for an hour and a half tour. they have yours in several languages. it was excellent.  without this you just wonder around and it's too big. it gets you to the right points.  so my suggestion us,to do this your and if you want to stay, you can,stay longer."
46,5.0,"The museum was very nice and I enjoyed their collection of potter, and the restaurant inside had a good variety of choices, but I loved this museum for its extensive grounds. We wandered all over the park area and enjoyed the playground, walking trails, pagodas, and lake. I almost didn't want to go inside. We were there in the spring and the cherry trees were in full bloom, but it would be beautiful in any season."
47,5.0,"I do love a good museum but this one is particularly impressive. It is incredibly large, very modern, and super organized. All of the signs are in English too so there are no issues with understanding everything."
48,4.0,"Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building with views to Namsan Hill. The park within the Museum is really beautiful, though our visit was in the dead of winter, i could image how beautiful it would be in other seasons - some of the trees have their botanic names.  Highly recommmended for a visit, if not just for the park grounds. Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts, and some in the park also."
49,5.0,"For those who want to understand more on Korean culture, everything is excellent in the National Museum of Korea, including the exhibition, souvenir shop, cafe and the attractive musical performance. I will definitely spend more time visiting the museum when I have a chance to get there again."
50,5.0,"National Museum was one of the big museum that we ever visited, and need more than 2 hours to look every exhibition inside it. Just like any other national museums, it had the exhibitions about past time. But they displayed all the artifacts in good arrangement. Besides that, they also had Korean culture exhibition. To reach this museum, just take mrt to Ichon Station and follow the directions. It's free of charge. If you come with kids, we suggest you to also visit Children museum."
51,3.0,"The museum is huge, I'm not sure you can see everything in one day. This is great if you are interested in Korean history. I personally wouldn't bring kids here as it can get a bit boring.There is a lot of pottery and the colors are bland, so if you are tired from your travels don't go there, it will put you to sleep, but overall art and history lovers will like it."
52,5.0,"The place is easy to reach, huge and has beautiful surroundings and building structures. Entrance is free. The inside of the museum is spacious, clean and it has chairs and lounges for those who need rest after walking around the museum. It is separated into different sections for different period or era or timeline, which was interesting and systematic of them. Recommend to download the apps as it will guide you on your trip to the history of Korea."
53,5.0,Learned a lot while browsing the exhibits. Definitely don't miss this if you're a fan of history and art.
54,5.0,"This place is a must visit for history lovers, to see the stody of Seoul and Korea. With modern architecture and adequate space, the museum is fantastic."
55,5.0,What a fantastic lace to visit - free admission is a bonus.Good way to learn about the korean history and culture. Precious artifact presented in a very simple and effective way with good english translation.The building is modern and has a nice view of the city from it's perimeter.
56,4.0,"This is a beautiful, massive museum and is incredibly well done. However, we were a bit disappointed because it was basically full of artifacts  from Korean and Eastern history. My kids kept calling it the ""pot"" museum. I should have done more research on the museum because we were hoping for more of an all-around history/culture/artifact museum. For such a big museum, a lot of the items seemed repetitive. If you like historical artifacts this is the place for you! We also spent about an hour at the Children's museum area which was nice. It is meant for younger children (probably 8 years or younger.)"
57,4.0,"This museum consolidates so much of the Korean history in one place and has some amazing artifacts.  The halls are broken up by time period or dynasty and walk you through what occurred in this nation.  There are 3 floors of different presentations showing the culture and resilience of the people. The Egyptian tour was happening at the same time,  but the free Korean section was better."
58,1.0,Very boring. Nothing interesting. Just artifacts that describes nothing. War Museum was way more interesting and you learn way more from that museum.
59,5.0,"Honestly, I wasn't surprise to find an amazing amount of Artists performed at the Museum. South Korea, one of the best leader on the Art scene today. So, we found Contemporary sound installations, reconfigured and cosmology art, so trendy for present days. Thumbs up!"
60,4.0,"The architecture of the museum is spectacular.  Its like going to a really top class , 5 star Hotel than a museum.  They  have a really worthy collection of Korean history and other areas. But before coming to this museum i would also recommend the Palace museum and also the King Sejong museum under the King sejong stature. They cover the parts of history which is important for Korean drama fans . this national museum adds to the experience. i only visited the korean section but not the other floors. I think about 2 hours will cover the korean section adequately. There are lots of seats on each floor if you have parents who don't want wander around."
61,5.0,"We were in town visiting brother who works at Hangyan teaching music.  He highly recommended this museum for the architectural features as well as the art and historical items.  We were surprised at the  majesty of the space we were moving through.  It appeared the building was thoughtfully built to house the art so that you are able to take in the art without developing Stendhal syndrome., or feeling that you have seen too much.  Highly recommend making this a must see on your next tour to Seoul."
62,4.0,We came in the morning. The museum is huge! We saw Korea's historical development through the years from medieval to modern art. The three Kingdoms history of artifacts and relics were displayed.
63,1.0,"I'm not an artist, so to see pottery and paintings is just my stereotype of a boring museum and this fit my stereotype exactly."
64,5.0,"The architecture of the Museum is wonderful, outside and inside the building everything has been rightly, carefully and beautifully designed. Concerning the design and presentation of the exhibitions is excellent: very clear presented, easy to understand all the rooms and artifacts. The quality of the pieces is extremely good, magnificent and very beautiful. A must in Seoul that you cannot miss. Besides the entrance is free."
65,5.0,I like its architecture and harmonious space with field and lake under open sky. I had a chance to enjoy free orchestral music on Saturday. It was great.
66,5.0,Easy access through metro station via Metro #4.No entrance fee.Good to understand Korean history from pre-historic to 19th century.
67,5.0,"Among my favorite museums in Seoul. I regularly go there with family, friends or even just by myself. What ever your mood or the weather a fantastic museum to go to year round."
68,4.0,"This very modern and massive building is impressive on its own. The historical artifacts are abundant and well displayed, but the old- fashioned, hands-off approach is typical of most museums in the world (therefore, the kids lose interest quickly). There are lots of details (English and Korean) for history buffs, lots of art to explore, pottery, furniture, and more. The museum is free, there are reasonably priced restaurants and coffee shops to rest your feet in, there's also a reasonably priced and large store to get some tasteful souvenirs at. They have a special exhibit hall which we missed, so I can't comment on it - Egypt in Feb and March 2017. You need a least 2 hours to get through it quickly, but 4 hours would be better if you want to read details.If the weather is nice, don't forget to go outside and walk around the grounds. There are pagodas, sculptures, water features, a giant bell, and some nice paths to stroll on. Keep walking east and you'll find a large playground/park.It's all worth the visit."
69,5.0,We really enjoyed our visit at this museum.  We were thrilled that they had an Egyptian display as a special exhibition.  Really well laid our and easy to access every floor.
70,4.0,"Entrance is free, although you may need to pay to see the special exhibitions (usually from overseas). Kids museum too. Massive modern space, laid out over three floors, well presented and interesting exhibits. A bit like Ikea in that you follow a tortuous route, but keep your eyes peeled as there are some stunning artifacts tucked away just off the main path."
71,5.0,"This is a very well presented look at Korean history from early days to present. It is a beautiful space with amazing artifacts, and there is also a children's component (the kid's part requires a timed entrance ticket, so grab one when you arrive if interested). We spent a day here and walked through the whole of the exhibits, and our children (7, 9, and 11) stayed engaged for the most part. The grounds are beautiful as well. Overall, a great overview of the history of Korea, and a recommended visit for anyone living here or visiting this fascinating country."
72,4.0,"Good place to spend a few hours to know about Korea history and the treasures of Korea. The place is huge so we first took the guided tour in English to get an overview of the museum. Only after that did we start exploring on our own.There is pretty good view outside of Namsan so a very nice picture spot. Food court is pretty good.  As this is our first stop after landing in Seoul, it serves as a good introduction to Korean food."
73,4.0,"This building is very impressive and large, good to learn about Korean history and it was free entry on the day we went. Inside there are quite a lot of exhibits, but some are very repetitive and plain. One room of porcelain crockery doesn't really showcase much....all kind of blank with no motifs or designs. There are some things worth seeing but all in all it feels like the space could be used with a lot more exhibits. Good museum for Seoul, but on a global scale it's fairly average at best. Worth visiting if time to spare or interested in Korean history, but if pushed for time may be better places to visit"
74,4.0,"The museum is big - really big.  I only spent a few hours there before my legs started getting tired, but you can probably spend a few days here digesting all the exhibitions and artifacts in this museum.  One note is that it is a substantial walk (although some of it is underground and protected from elements) from Ichon subway station to the museum.What is interesting is that the outside of the museum hold some of the greatest views in Seoul.  There is a large man-made lake in front of the museum, as well as a large open area in the entrance of the museum.  There is also an area where you have a great view of Namsan Mountain and N Seoul Tower.The museum inside is very modern and expansive.  There is a lot of free space, though punctuated by a ten story pagoda in the lobby area of the museum.  There are three floors filled with exhibits and artifacts.  Definitely worth a visit of a few hours."
75,4.0,"The museum is so big and they have great collections of different ages. Personally I was expecting more for them to be the ''national'' museum and Korea has so many amazing museums all over the country. Other museums in Seoul like Samsung museum was more impressive and they carry sophisticated products. But it's still a great museum with restaurants(okay) and cafes(great tea room) for spending your whole day. There are exhibits outside too. They provide museum study tour for children too, we saw korean families bringing their children and the kids join the tour by themselves(get a lunch break with their parents) but I don't know if they have one in English."
76,5.0,This Museum is recommended to travellers who wants to know more about the history of Korea. There are also souvenir items to be bought at an affordable prices.
77,5.0,The National Museum of Korea will take you on a historical journey through the different ages of South Korea.
78,5.0,This location is walking distance from the Ichon and Seobinggo metro stops.  The museum has several interesting displays that are worth seeing as well as a kids section.  Next door is the Hangul Museum which is also a nice visit.  Enjoy both in one trip!
79,4.0,very good place to know korean history. kids can try to something and see some kind of show. there are many things to see.
80,5.0,"When traveling with kids, it is always good to know where to go with them, if the weather is not so good. The kids museum at the National Museum of Korea is one great option. Just be aware, there are time slots which can be either booked online, or on site. Once your time slot is over, you have to leave. Depending on the amount of people going in, you can go in a second time, but this might be dependent on your time and date (not in heigh season presumably). Kids can enjoy and learn hands on while at the museum."
81,4.0,"This museum is amazing. The place is simply massive. It includes exhibits not only from Korea, but from all over Asia. We spent a half day here, and only left because we were getting hungry. You could easily spend an entire day. Admission is free, and the location is easy to access from the metro."
82,4.0,Impressive array of Korean historical and religious exhibits. Beautiful Buddist sculptures and statues.
83,4.0,National Museum of Korea is subdivided into many areas. Exhibiting the different dynasty that ruled over Korea
84,5.0,Free museum that tells the young history of Korea.  I learned a lot from its time lined exhibit.  There was a free photos shots we could take and print for ourselves.  i.e. I love Korea.
85,5.0,Lots to see and learn. Is a good place to visit with the family.  You can easily sent hours admiring everything in the museum.
86,5.0,Easy to get to on the metro. Great museum with interning floors showing the countries timeline. There are cafes and restaurant and picnic area. You must talk a walk outside where there are outdoor exhibits in lovely planted gardens with pools and lakes. Very popular with Korean families.
87,4.0,Another grand installation in Seoul displaying Korean history in a grandeur setting. But the facility is not wheel chair friendly.
88,3.0,This is a very very large Museum.  That said the display space was about normal.  Each floor of galleries has it's own emphasis.  The shop has many wonderful gift ideas.  Admission is free of charge.  Now the grounds and the view up to Namsan are spectacular.
89,5.0,"Lots of beautiful pieces from Korean history and arts: buddhas, celadon, lacquered boxes, etc. Beautiful grounds, as well.  Restaurant serves Italian pasta, as well as Korean food."
90,5.0,"We had a 7am family photoshoot here with a professional photographer and found the surroundings of the museum to be very beautiful and well maintained. Clearly, the city takes a great pride in its museum. The scale of the enormous buildings are also something else to behold - truly impressive. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go into the museum itself as we had to leave at 9am but the surround park is definitely worthwhile as a visit."
91,5.0,Anyone interested in the history of Korea this is the place to visit. I had a great time exploring the exhibits!!! It had 3 floors and a place to eat at the top floor.
92,5.0,"Nice beautiful vase and all the treasures you can see. I can't remember it was free but it was pretty cheap at least. The building is new,  a small house on the lake is not an old one, but still beautiful at day and night! Nice museum! :)"
93,4.0,"Impressive building, free of charge and quite organized. There are few good coffee shops inside the museum with good views, prices are affordable considering free entrance to a good museum"
94,5.0,"One of the most impressive museums I ever visited, the accessibility of the museum is great, near a metro station.The museum is huge, you can spend here 4-5 hours easily.I really recommend the Calligraphies sections of the museum, there are some amazing art works there and also informative explanation on that unique art.I were there on a weekend during the summer vacation and it was great to see there local Korean families, couples and friends enjoy the museum silently and seriously as part of their culture, it was one example out of many to the uniqueness of the Korean people."
95,4.0,"I must confess that my knowledge of S Korea was limited to what we see on TV, so it was a surprise to see the rich customs, tradition and history in one location. It was a pleasant eye opener, and a great way to learn about this wonderful country and its people. Well worth a visit."
96,5.0,It was the most amazing and knowledgeable museum about Asian countries history there was different way to introduce the information by pictures or TV with vedio in korean and English it was for free
97,4.0,"We enjoyed the Children's section of this museum and the main exhibits were a nice look at some of Korea's history. Best of all, the museum is free!"
98,5.0,Art and relics are astounding. Well laid out. Gift shop is superb. Had a great time viewing prehistoric relics to well preserved national treasures.
99,4.0,"The museum is very nice, clean, and neat.Entrance is for free to the museum, and have scheduled free english tours."
100,4.0,"A good way to immerse in the cultural history of Korea. Very big, will take a lot of time. Grounds are also good to spend some peaceful time."
101,5.0,"Really is a must visit.  Spacious grounds and museum exhibits you'd be wandering around going wow, wow, wow."
102,5.0,Much to see here. You could easily spend a day enjoying this gem; from ancient times to modern day Korea. The building itself is part of the exhibit. It must be glorious when the flowers and gardens are in bloom
103,5.0,"This was on our agenda as part of our last minute trip to Seoul and one of the best places to visit. Step back into history of the Korean history, very rich in culture as well. For all my korean drama loving friends, this would provide a good lineage and background on some of the dramas depicting the past.We took the free English tour, and we were brought through to almost 2 hours of very interesting facts and lessons, something which we might not have gathered if we had just walked around the museum. Our guide was a retiree, and his English was very easy to understand. It is amazing to see his passion as he brought us through.The main exhibition hall was free for the public to enter. Noted also that there was a children's museum and a special exhibition (paid) that probably changes depending on the theme. You would probably need 2-3 days to finish everything, otherwise just review the map and zoom in on the sections that interest you."
104,4.0,"This museum is huge and provides a lot of information. I wish more was in english, but we enjoyed it. You need a few hours or a couple days to get through all of it fully."
105,3.0,Very impressive building and a credit to the nation for erecting such a building to house the priceless history. English text is light and enough for a quick viewing of the displays. More detailed texts for people not familiar with Korean history or time periods would add to the experience and also enhance interest in Korean history. Only gave 3 stars as we attended on a Wednesday and visitors were light. No more audio guides were available. Also there are no coffee shops available inside the main exhibition areas and this is surprising due to the amount of coffee shops available elsewhere in Korea.
106,5.0,Visited this place to get to in depth understanding of the nation from the history point; interesting enough to understand the transformation of the nation and people perspective of living here...
107,4.0,"My children, (15, 13 and 10), and I spent about 2 hours here.  It could take 1/2 day to thoroughly viewing and reading everything.  However, we've been to so many museums in Asia already, so we skipped many parts of this museums.  We only viewed the Korean history.  It's not only big and beautiful, but it's also free to the public.  We enjoyed our 2 hours there."
108,4.0,"Most subway is Line 4 Ichon. There is underpass linking the subway to about 100m away from the museum entrance, a nice thought for rainy or snowy days. The museum has three floors and many sits for you to rest (it is very big) and free drinking water at each corners. Korean history on Level 1. History of its links to Japan and China in Level 3."
109,4.0,"If it is rainy day or even beautiful on, it worth it, because park near museum is beautiful. Museum itself is very vivid. Typical stuff like ceramics, arts, caligraphy, buddhas, war equipment etc."
110,4.0,It was a sunny day and warm. Also field trip for the elementary age kids. They waved Hi for my camera :) Great history on Korea.
111,4.0,"The Koreans are very well known for their Love of country & this National Museum is a proud testament to that. A huge infrastructure, a well curated collection I can spend a whole day just walking through the collections. A nice museum cafe & huge museum store awaits your visit. I just love museum stores."
112,4.0,"I went to here next week and there's a nice museum.Many exhibits in a modern building with many children and their parents.If you are hungry you also can have lunch here just more expensive than outside .And I also met a couple on a bunch to a picture from India,really art date.And near the outside,there's a park that's a family park exactly.If you want you can go picnic with your family members."
113,5.0,The building itself is worth seeing. Built in the old USArmy base it is just a wonderful space to have a break from the  bussel of Seoul. We were there for three hours and only saw 1/4 of the displays.
114,4.0,"well designed, easy to get around, airy and spacious with exhibits well displayed. easy to get to on public transport."
115,5.0,We got there early in the day and spent many hours exploring the beautiful building. We learnt a lot about Korean and Asian history. We visited the restaurant over looking the lake and had an amazing meal. The grounds surrounding it are very pretty . It is well worth a visit.
116,4.0,"Plan to spend at least half a day at the museum. Lots of interesting art, religious artifacts, and historical info."
117,5.0,The museum provided us with a glimpse of the history of Korea and the way people lived before and after the division of the two Koreas.  It gave us the simplicity of their alphabet and language as well as their crafts.
118,4.0,Quite good - very big so you will need to allocate a few hours if you want to get around the whole place.
119,5.0,It was very interesting viewing history from another part of the world.    Plan on spending quite a bit of time here.
120,4.0,I loved how the museum was laid out! It took you through Korean history through objects and art work. The videos in between made it feel a little interactive and allowed some rest too. We went on a Sunday afternoon and found it quite empty!
121,4.0,"I spent a couple hours with my dad, especially on the 2nd floor. He is a lover of Chinese calligraphy, so he was in heaven. Don't miss the golden crowns of Silla on 1st floor and the Goryeo era pagoda."
122,5.0,Beautiful and spacious Museum with very interesting artifacts.We had an English guide to help explain history of Korea.  Everyone should visit to learn to history of this beautiful country.
123,4.0,"It is AWESOME, if you want history BOOM you got it. The Food is okay... I guess. But for history lovers it is going to be awesome."
124,5.0,"While the collection at this museum is fantastic and offers a great overview of Korean history, the building is equally impressive and a lovely place to spend a few hours.  Even the cafeteria is attractive and the food is pretty good.  The museum, especially the first floor, is laid out very well and walks visitors through Korean history - explaining the Dynasties and highlighting important events and leaders.  The collection of artifacts is impressive - my kids particularly enjoyed seeing the various types of ancient money.If you have children, be sure to check out the attached Children's Museum as well (reservations may be required here)."
125,5.0,Excellent museum with Free admission. The exhibits are pretty comprehensive. good in learning their history.
126,3.0,"Visually, this museum is beautiful and impressive, but I would not bother going unless you are interested in Korean history presented in a very traditional way.  Items under glass with labels giving some very dry information on them.  Very formal and cold.  Definitely not for children but probably better for adults with more background in ancient Korean history who can appreciate the items on display."
127,4.0,we had a great time when we visited the national museum of korea there are lots of galleries where each has it's own theme . the museum itself is informative and you will learn a lot .
128,3.0,"An acceptable attraction if you have a couple of hours to spare. The museum is free and easy to get to (it has it's own subway station) however I wouldn't put it at the top of my hit list if I was back in Seoul. The displays are interesting up until a certain point but there is very little variation in what you see. I saw a lot of pottery and weaponry but nothing interactive. However, the 12 story Pagoda in the center of the hall is worth seeing."
129,4.0,"Very large campus. I was there when they had a wing set aside for a special display on the Korean War. If you are a military buff, you HAVE to visit this museum. Armored vehicles, choppers and planes on display outside. Even the entrance to the property with huge statues dedicated to the war will keep you for 10 minutes snapping photos. I intend to go back again."
130,5.0,"its was  a great experience to visit this museum, well articolated and pleasent to visit. The rooms are very well organizated and the description is very well presented. Shops are very nice to buy items and things for kids. I will visit the museum again."
131,4.0,"There is so much to see and do here... the Buddah statues on the third floor, the three story pagoda inside, the ancient artifacts (local and abroad), art gallery, kids zone, cafe, large underground parking area, friendly staff (mostly), clean and cool on a hot day, performances etc.. really good place to just go unplanned, you won't regret it. No entry fee for general admission to museum exhibit, ₩10,000+ for special exhibits."
132,5.0,"This museum is huge! This three story museum has so much to offer from prehistoric era through  more current Asian art. There are paintings, pottery, furniture, calligraphy on scrolls, things from architecture, figurines and more.In the middle of the first floor is a large pagoda that you can't go in, but it's tall and impressive.As you go around it was nice that all the items had descriptions in English so you could really learn about what you were looking at. Also there was information about what things were going on at the time period that the art is from, such as during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. There were some gold crowns which surprised me some and some cool paintings. We particularly liked a cat painting, some of the ceramic decorated plates, and a samurai uniform.While it's a museum of Korea they also had artwork from India, Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. There were stairs, escalators (which my son thought was fun), and elevators to get between floors. There were restrooms on each floor as well. There was a food court and a museum shop to buy souvenirs. There was so much to see here you could easily spend many hours. We actually got tired towards the end and skipped a few galleries."
133,4.0,The visit gave us some idea of how the people have struggled thru the recent past but it is a colorful experience  to see how hard the people worked to survive
134,4.0,"Almost too big with too much stuff, too repetitive. I recommend going a few times perhaps a floor at a time. It is not of the same level as the British Museum or the Smithsonian but certainly worth your time."
135,5.0,"Everything about the museum is well done, and it's free to the public! My daughters (7 and 9) love museums, and they've enjoyed repeat visits. This experience is everything you might expect from a museum you might visit in Washington D.C."
136,5.0,"This museum was a complete package of artifacts spanning over 3-4 millenia of Korean history. Complete with prehistoric ones, of course! The flagship museum of South Korea offers a detailed look at the history of Korea and the Korean peninsula, top it all off with artifacts from various regions of Asia. A must-see!"
137,5.0,"big museums and family park with toddlers. there's a convenience store, 2 or 3 restaurants, English narration by headsets in the museums. u can access there by walk directly from Ichon station.if u have a stroller, no problem, there's an elevator."
138,5.0,Huge and beautiful. This has to be the most impressive museum I have ever seen. A must see. You will know why I boast when you get there.
139,4.0,"It is quite big, with a lot of things to see and it is for FREE.I think it is worth a visit. They offer some guided tour, so better check the schedule in advance. It seems the guide are  volunteers. I joined one tour and  I had the impression that my guide had no deep knowledge, but I might be mistaken."
140,5.0,"The museum is oversize, a huge repository of Korean culture and history dating back to prehistoric times.  It's almost impossible to take so much.  The audio tour is very poorly done and not helpful however, the displays are very well done."
141,5.0,"Great place to spend the afternoon. Admission is free and the exhibits are wonderful. Spend time in the outdoor garden, it's lovely."
142,5.0,great w a curator the museum provided. learned Korean history more than we read on the book. amazingly more collections than we saw 30 years before.
143,4.0,"It is big inside, antiques are not so many but all are in very condition and are arranged classically and interestingly.  Water clock is  a MUST."
144,5.0,"A great museum, but make sure you are on top of your Korean history before you visit.  The food court and gift shop are excellent choices - and stroll the grounds to see all the pagodas."
145,5.0,"I went here and it totally blew me away. One word; Amazing! A must see, great for both kids and adults to learn something new about Korea."
146,5.0,"We went early in the morning and spent the entire day...the only way to really appreciate it.  All displays are described in 3 languages - English, Chinese, and Korean.  If you just arrived in Korea it will give you an overview of their history (goes back almost as far as China's).  We had been in Korea for 2 weeks traveling from Busan so had a good background in Korea's history but this museum put it all into perspective for us...tied it all together so it would make more sense.  If you only visit one place in Seoul this should be it."
147,5.0,"It was well organized, clean and had amazing things to look at. The history was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this as stop."
148,4.0,"Recently built, this huge building is filled with tons of artifacts showing the rich history of Korea.  It's worth several hours BUT if you only have time for one such museum--and don't mind paying--the Leeum Samsung is better."
149,4.0,"Free as people have mentioned except special exhibits.  The space outside is nice too.  There are free lockers so you don't have to lug too much stuff around especially in the winter.  (you put in a small amount and get it back when you return the key).  Also for Running Man fans, they have been in this museum at least twice! so it will look familiar to you!"
150,5.0,History-filled place - great place to know more about the history of Korea.Accessible and located near the City's tourist spots too
151,4.0,You may take seoul city tour bus drop you right infront of the National Museum the building is unique with lots of information in there.
152,5.0,"Our family of three spend a whole day here. The exhibits were interesting and the guided tour was very informative. We got a glimpse into the history of Korean and its people, and got to know them a little better."
153,5.0,"Excellent place to start to understand Korean history and culture. The architecture is stunning, so is the view.  Admission is free and as the place is huge with 3-4 floors of exhibit, do allocate sufficient time (min 1 hour) to go through the exhibits without rush."
154,4.0,"The building is of gigantic dimension, and so is the exhibition. However, it's standard display scenography, not much interaction. Most exhibits have description text in English. Reserve at least half a day, if you seriosly want to ""see"" most of it."
155,5.0,"Even if the Museum were empty, you should visit this place. It's free, and the modern museum is colossal. The park it is located in is also refreshing and offers nice views of YongSan and NamSan in the backdrop. Fortunately, the museum is far from empty. What I really appreciated about it was the fact that there is no distinction between ""history"" and ""art"". It's neither a Fine-Arts museum nor a Museum of History, and each artifact (painting, object, portrait, manuscript) tells you a lot about the entire history and culture of Korea. Interestingly, all the artifacts are entirely different from what you could find in Western countries, as canvas painting and stone sculpture are almost inexistent, but replaced by local art forms (ink-wash paintings, ornaments, relics, calligraphy, ceramics), giving a different view and perspective on art production and techniques."
156,5.0,When I went here I I'm so overwhelmed about the Korean culture. They really value and they are taking a good care of their culture and tradition.
157,4.0,It's the best Museum in Korea. You can meet treasure of Art and culture. located in I-chon Subway station on blue line. hug park with so you can injoy go for a walk.
158,4.0,Thorough information on the history of Korea which I enjoyed. Don't forget to enjoy the scenic view outside the Museum and snap lots of pictures.
159,5.0,We had not visited this place before but so glad we did this time. Beautiful building and a stunning Korean pottery gallery that showed the most amazing collection.
160,5.0,"National museum of Korea was transferred to the current location in 2005. It really includes a huge of cultural assets. It takes one day long to view them in detail. Many locals, students and kids visit this place. Nearby there are Yongsan family park, War Museum of Korea."
161,5.0,We went early on Oct.3rd which was a holiday. Very few people when we arrived so had the chance to see alot in a relatively short period of time. Exhibits were awesome and the building was bright airy and clean. My wife was interviewed by two high school students doing a project on visitor's reaction to both the Museum and Seoul in general. Gift shop was well stocked and prices were reasonable. The museum in spacious.
162,4.0,"It's huge. It's almost as big as an airport terminal.  The exhibits were well curated, although it would be nice to have a diorama exhibit to show how the early Koreans lived. Would love also to have a replica Hanok village, as a light and sound exhibit."
163,5.0,"Given the brutal treatment of this lovely country through history, it is go good to see how much they have from their rich cultural past.Huge building, crazy cheap to enter, you can wander here for a couple of hours and still not see it all. A sophisticated, very impressive devotion to all things intellectual and artistic, Korean history comes to life here through the objects and you realise how advanced a culture it has been, when you look at the dates of things like the art and written materials"
164,5.0,"Its worth the trip to the museum.  It was free to enter and covers the evolution of the country, culture & prehistory.   Be prepared to spend a minimum of 4 hours .  There are also nice walking trails and areas for a picnic on the grounds around the museum.  They had a children's museum next door and special exhibits which you need to pay for but we didn't have time to visit."
165,5.0,"That's a really big complex of facilities at the same place. Only the museum is really big and has a lot of pieces of the Korean history as well some other countries. Outside there are other things to do, pagoda samples, a little waterfall, a park and others. I would take a tour or try to rent a mp3 there to hear about the items while you are there, i think it would be a better experience."
166,4.0,The items inside are  worth to see. There is a funny machine to take photos but we can't receive the emails with the photos. :( Disappointed.
167,5.0,"Love this museum. We've been to many museums around the world - most SI museums in DC, the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay in Paris, British Museum in London, National Palace Museum in Taipei, and others. This one compares to all of above favorably. The museum is new (just moved there in 2005), huge and open, with an authoritative collection of Korean culture artifacts.Our tip is that almost ever day, there is a great English tour at 2 PM. We joined the English tour group (around 12 people) on Tuesday 7/8, led by an amazing gentleman named Mooyong Kim. His English is amazing, has a vast vocabulary that describes the museum and its collections perfectly, and has a deep understanding of Korean history. He spent the first 15 minutes going through the Korean history, from ancient to recent times. Not being Korean, this really sets a great foundation of knowledge for us to enjoy the rest of the museum. He then took us to the important works in the museum and explain how they are important to the Koreans, including the national treasures like the ten-story Pagoda, the Gold Crown, gold necklace, Buddha statues, various ceramic works, etc.After the 90-minute guided tour, we spent another couple of hours in the museum looking through the other works. If you're visiting the museum, I highly recommend the free English guided tour offered by the museum."
168,4.0,"This museum is spacious and well laid out, with great exhibits showcasing the history of Korea. It isn't the Smithsonian, so don't expect that, but it is very nice. It takes the visitor from the prehistoric ages to present, through the many changes that the Korea culture has undergone. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the unique and interesting history of this place. While we were visiting there was a touring exhibit from the Musee d'Orsey of France with beautiful pieces from the impressionists. There is a small cost to the extra exhibits, but the museum itself is free of charge. If you choose to eat there, the only food we found on offer was local food - be forewarned."
169,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised to see that a traveling collection of Impressionist Art from Paris' Musee d'Orsay was at the National Museum of Korea the day we showed up.  After enjoying that, we toured the regular collection, which features Buddhist art, Korean ceramics, landscape paintings, medieval pieces, and so much more that one day wasn't enough.  Best of all, the regular collections are free admission, so you can return another day to finish looking.  All the facilities are of an excellent standard."
170,5.0,What a fantastic facility. Give yourself plenty of time and breaks. The first floor ancient history section can take several hours; very well done.
171,5.0,"A great collection on 3 floors of a building designed with outstanding functionality. We went 3 times to the museum: twice during a previous visit and once this time. Our favorite collections are on 3rd and 1st floor. Plus, they have a great tea room. If you like a good green tea, go for it."
172,4.0,"This museum is very family-friendly. There is a cafeteria with lots of choices both traditional and ""fast food"". The gift shop has many fun cultural items that your kids can take home and treasure for a long time. Best of all, there is a childrens museum attached that is completely hands-on. We have been here several times as it is free and a fun way to spend an afternoon.Check out the extensive grounds outside as there is a playground, pond, waterfall, and Yongsan Family Park is accessible by walking the path. If you want other places to visit in the area grab a taxi to go around the bend to IPark Mall/Yongsan Station where you will also find the electronics market. Or take a taxi the opposite direction to go to Itaewon. It's even feasible to walk there if you feel like having a stroll."
173,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is an impressive modern construction situated in a quiet quarter of hectic Seoul. The construction is huge and impressive, attesting to  the love and respect of Koreans for its past cultural treasures. The interior is spacious and allows easy access to visitors. However, one wished that it would contain more cultural treasures of the rich artistic heritage of the country. Statues, porcelains and paintigs are quite representative but they lack some outstanding references like the Monalisa in the Louvre, or the Elgin Marbles of the British Museum. It is to be hoped that more important cultural heritage masterpieces are brought to this magnificent space in order to fill up the avid artistic interests of the visitor."
174,5.0,"We had a lovely and informative visit to the National Museum of Korea. The tour guide was an incredibly knowledgable volunteer who spent extra time explaining areas we were interested in and answering many questions. It ended up being a very personal tour experience since only the 3 members of my family were on the tour. She mentioned that winter is a slow tourist season and so many of her winter groups were very small. The artifacts were incredible. While the posted signs are all in English and it is easy to enjoy this museum without a guided tour, the background and stories she provided really helped provide a cultural and historic context. So much more meaningful that just reading the signs. Her English was incredible and her passion for history was evident. Be sure to check the schedule and arrive at front desk right at the time the English tour is offered. It is free and starts punctually so you don't want to miss it. We stopped in the museum cafe after the tour (which was supposed to last 1.5 hours but she asked if we wanted to extend it and we spent 2.5 hours together.) There aren't many restaurants in the area outside of the museum. The food in the museum was ok. Not great but we were happy to support their service since the museum and tour were free. Also they have a cute coffee shop and lovely tea shop in the museum. The tea shop seemed quiet with few visitors. The coffee shop was lively and delicious for a quick snack and warm up. VERY easy to get to museum from subway. Just get out the stop and follow the signs. A subway tunnel walks directly to museum entrance."
175,4.0,"This museum tell you story of korea. Also near with the palace an blue house. So if you go here, you will see all of them in one time. Better come in the morning. You can hire the voice gude for 1000 won or use your smarphone as voice guide."
176,4.0,Admission is free with lots of interesting and varied displays in a large airy modern building. Worth the hours to take in the historical and cultural exhibits! But beware they r closed on Monday! We went on a mon n had to return the next day :(
177,3.0,"The building was just lovely.  But sadly, not many significant artifacts here.  Display cases and descriptions in both Korean and English are presented beautifully and well planned. Cafeteria food in the museum is good and affordable. There's a room for nursing mothers.  Long travelator from subway was helpful for our tired feet!"
178,4.0,We visited this museum on a quick family trip to Seoul for a wedding.  Decided to go to this museum since it was close to the church and was FREE!  The museum is very large and a thorough visit should allow at least 3-4 hours.  The exhibits are mostly well lit and signed with adequate English translations.  Some great artifacts and Korean and Asian history from medieval times on.  The building itself and the grounds are quite interesting and fun to see so take a walk around (unless it is August and the heat and humidity melt you!).  While we were there a special exhibit (extra charge) was open but we did not go to it due to short time.  We went on a sunday and the lines for the children's museum exhibit was really long and people said it was great!  The location is right on a subway stop so easy to get in and out of.  Cabs are also available right on the corner.  The gift shop and cafe are really nice too and well priced.
179,5.0,The space is spectacular. Highly recommended. The exhibits are laid out imaginatively. This is probably the best museum in Seoul.
180,5.0,"This place is huge!  Not only does it have signs in English as well as Korean, but they're actually grammatically correct.  We only had time to see the first floor, but it goes through the history of Korea from the Neolithic period through modern day via artifacts... really interesting!"
181,5.0,"Exciting - a school group listening in awe to a teacher's story. lots of placenta jars. and free! A really nice introduction to Korean culture. In the same grounds as a palace, so the full Korean experiance"
182,5.0,"It is a very interesting and valuable place to visit, it not only shows their history but also a lot of excellent selection of exhibits provided by other countries... and it is totally free of charge (except the special exhibition in the Special Exhibition Gallery), and the staff are very nice and friendly, they saw my mum with the wheel chair, the staff always checked us out to see whether we need help.  The Digital/Audio-guided Tours (PDA/MP3) is very convenient.The whole building is big and clean too, it is worth to visit!  I did spend a whole day inside and the food inside the museum's restaurant is quite expensive, but the food of the little cafe outside ( near the subway station) is delicious with reasonable price.It is a must visiting place when you stay in Seoul."
183,5.0,My family enjoyed their trip to the museum very much. there was nothing I disliked about the place and particulary liked that there was lots of info in English for us foreign visitors.
184,5.0,Be sure to go to the 3rd floor where the Buddha statutes are displayed. If you are looking for something to eat there is a nice snack bar at the mall entrance. Subway exits right out to the mall.
185,4.0,"I guess you should judge a Museum by it's contents primarily but it must be said that the building is quite stunning. Free admission, English tours, and English language guide maps make a visit very easy and enjoyable. I found the antiquities from Neolithic through to Silla period very rewarding, some superb gold royal regalia, and the usual array of stone and iron weapons and implements. Large pottery display. An uninformed guess would be that Korea may well still have a lot of archaeological work still to come.Excellent video explanation of the construction of the funerary mounds I had just seen in Gyeongju over the previous days.More audio visual stuff we did not explore on a short visit.I did not have time to check out the arts and crafts and painting on the floors above.A restaurant onsite which looked good but we patronised the food court/coffee shop which was fine. Lots of staff, usual Korean courtesy and welcome."
186,5.0,"If you want to have an overwhelming experince, visit the National Museum of Korea.   Some of the best antique gold work in the world are on display at the museum.  There are atrifacts from paleolithic times to the present.  Plan on a full day there -- have lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants on site."
187,5.0,"It's an amazing experience there.Seeing all the candle statues perform the old way of Korean lifestyle.Showing the korean dresses from time to timeIt's sad that we can't use our camera's flash so all the pictures are noise and some of them blur but over all the picture things, all are great"
188,4.0,We walked quite far away from subway to museum.Its a building consist of several story.Each story has its own exhibition theme regarding the history and culture of Korea.You have to spend about 3 hours time here if you really want to see all the place. There is a restaurant beside the museum.
189,5.0,"Our family visited the museum and found it to be exceptional historically, educationally and highly accessible. I recommend that you set aside an entire day for the museum."
190,4.0,"It's a really huge museum in my opinion and there are lots to learn from here. When we visited, there was an exhibition on the history of Korea. We thought that the exhibits were well-maintained and there were many artefacts which made it more interesting than simply reading about Korea's history. There is a food place in the museum, which makes it easy to spend a whole day in the museum learning about different things. Recommended if you are someone who is interested in history and museums in general (:"
191,4.0,Good to gain some knowledge about Korean history. You need to spend at least 1 day there to cover maybe 60% of the place!
192,4.0,"Although a history major, I do not know a lot about Korean history, the museum brought me up to date with lots of artifacts with well written (if stilted) English descriptions. Worth a look and it's free!"
193,5.0,its an amazing place to see that builds so much respect in your heart for the Korean people! What a nation!
194,5.0,"We went for an English guided tour and found to our amazement that we were only 4 to be guided. So we had an almost private tour. It was very interesting to see the Crown from the Silla period, the pensive Bodhisattva. The museum is very open spaced and modern. We give it our best recommendations."
195,5.0,Has only been opend a few years.  Be prepared to get lost. 3 floors.  Beautifully done.  Found the food court a little daunting.
196,4.0,"The building which houses the museum is  modern, bright and well designed. The museum is divided into sections on various levels and there are some coffee shops both inside and in the external part of the building."
197,5.0,"The building alone is worth the trip as it is impressive, but the collection it contains outshines it. The exhibits are thoughtfully grouped to make them understandable within the context of Korean history and culture. The marking of some individual items as national treasures is also instructive. The collection of calligraphy and Buddhist sculpture is excellent."
198,5.0,The collections are described in English and Korean and are well presented and amazingly old. The second floor was not near as crowded as the first which had tons of kids and families. And IT's FREE.
199,5.0,It thorough displayed lives of Korean from stone age to modern days. I was fasnated by the artifacts they were able to collect and exhibit.
200,5.0,Make sure you reserve online before going. PDA guide was great for kids.
201,5.0,"Nice place to get to know of Korea's History, culture and see the artifacts. Great collections to see"
202,5.0,"It had been recommended to us to visit the museum early in our vacation to get a taste of Korean history and culture. There were absolutely right.  The museum was awesome, and make sure to walk around the park after."
203,4.0,"At the National Museum of Korea, visitors will learn how Korean people lived and performed ceremonies in the ancient time."
204,4.0,Impressive building and presentation. We had a 45 minute to explore this place and stuck to the main exhibition hall on the 2nd floor. The museum is more a photographic and written presentation of modern Korean history than artifacts. Free entry.
