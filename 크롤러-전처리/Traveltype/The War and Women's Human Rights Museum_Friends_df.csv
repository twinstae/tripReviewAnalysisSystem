1,5.0,It was very touching to learn about the lives of the comfort women of Korea and what they have gone through. They have a guided recording (mp3 and earphones) that you can listen to that will explain to you the exhibits as you walk along.
2,5.0,"On a recent family visit to Seoul we had the fortune to engage a vehicle and tour guide. The visit to the museum was more than we expected. However, we did have the added advantage of a tour guide who was able to explain in detail all aspects of what we were shown. This is a must if you have the chance to visit the area."
3,5.0,"While there are many fun things to do in Seoul, such as the Trickeye museum, shopping and kpop galore, it is also worthwhile to take a visit to this museum. Touching upon a part of history that is still quite unknown to people (although there have been more attention to this issue recently) this museum gives you insight to the ""comfort women"" issue of the past where many females in Japanese colonialized and occupied areas were forced to be military sex slaves for the Japanese army. Although a lot of people write this off as a ""japanese-korean"" problem, it isn't necessarily as it applies to a lot of similar issues in the present right now such as human trafficking. I won't write too much on this, only that if time permits - you won't be dissapointed visiting this museum and I would hope that you'd leave inspired to understand more about violence against women."
