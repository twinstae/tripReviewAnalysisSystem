0,4.0,"This site is listed as a should do, so we did. We travelled by Metro to the Yeoinaru Station and took a ten minute walk to the building.The visit to the building is free when you purchase a Seoul Tourist Pass, otherwise entry to the 60th Floor viewing floor plus Art Gallery, and the aquarium in the basement costs 25000₩, I think.It was very quiet on the Tuesday of our visit. No crowds and we certainly enjoyed the view of the city and the river Han plus the numerous bridges crossing the river. The Art Gallery on that 60th Floor is interesting and ""easy to interpret"", with several focus on young children.The aquarium in the basement was not huge, with a good collection of sea life. The mermaid swim show at the end of the walk in the aquarium certainly got a lot of the children's attention."
1,5.0,"Amazing view from the top. Restaurants, acuariums, museums and shopping are available inside the building."
2,4.0,"This is the first time I travel to Korea and The 63 city buildings was the best with beautiful yellow glass roof, You can relax on the top with a cup of coffee & enjoy amazing view wit winding river HAN and bridges in sunny day.The yellow color of the glass is the feature of the building. 63 building (63 City) is the corporate headquarters of Hanwha, located on the Yeoido island, Seoul capital. 63 building is the world's highest that covered by gold glass."
3,5.0,"Amazing views from the 63 Building.  Parking was plentiful, people were friendly, lots to see and do but the main attraction is the views from the top, well worth the stay for the sunset and city lights illumination."
4,5.0,"The 63 Buiding (63 City) is located near Hangang Park and  not to forget, Yeoido Park and the well-known television broadcast stations KBS & MBC. From 63 City to Itaewon, it takes not so long for the distance via subway but it way too far walking down from Hangang Park to the subway station. If you are not that prefers to walk, then you could take a cab. But, believe me…it was fascinating to spend times walking since Hangang Park was ready to accompany your way along to the station. I mean, it worth a fresh air even it was afternoon! There are a few different attractions in th building. The main attractions are an aquarium, wax museum, IMAX cinema the lookout on the 60th floor which also doubles as an art museum. You can buy combination tickets to see multiple attractions for a discount. As is so often the case in Korea, you have to grab a queue ticket. Don't be a nonga (like me) and wait in the non-existent line. lol."
5,4.0,"Plan on spending some time wondering around, window shopping, stopping for a bite to eat or a coffee. You can go to Seaworld or a wax museum. Or take the glass elevator to the very top for a wonderful 360 view of Seoul. You need to buy a ticket first, get a number and wait for your number to be called to buy your ticket. Do not let the long line scare you away, it goes fast. At the top is an art museum and small snack shop. But mainly you are going up for the view so try to go in a clearer day. Enjoy!"
6,5.0,"I got there getting off on Daebang Station and got the bus no. 11, right in front os the station, coming out by exit 6 (I coundnt found the shuttle bus indicated in the official web site) and it took around 20min. We selected 3 attractions: performance,  wax museum and art gallery. We purchase these 3 attractions by 35.000 won. At the beginning we just asked for the girl the performance and the wax museum and it will be 55,000 won so the kind attendent suggest one more attraction (the art gallery) for a lower price. There are the packages showed up in display panel which offers the attractions in a much lower price than taking each one separately but all offered the SeaWorld that I wasn't really interested in. So u can ask for packages in a cheaper price besides what they offer in the ticket booth display.All the attractions really worth in my opinion mainly the performance which was a Marionette show of 70 exciting minutes. Outstanding perfomance with led lights and breaking dance with English subtitles when it was needed.To get the gallery,  which was Cinderella theme, I recommend to try get in first in the elevator because u can see all han river while you are going up because it is a ""glass elevator"". I went there in a Saturday night and it was really crowd and I rarely saw someone interested in the art, everybody goes there because of the view. The gallery is on 60 floor and the other 3 floor under it there are fency restaurants. And the others high floors u cannot access.  Thus the high view is allowed just paying to watch the gallery or eating in one of the restaurants I mentioned. The wax museum was good to take funny pictures that I could do easily because there was no one there as I got there almost on the close time, 10pm."
7,3.0,"Nice views but through a window though, so could not take nice photos. Was not too crowded. The entrance was difficult to find."
8,3.0,It was ok but not too impressive.  We went to the sky art gallery that gave access to there observatory.  I wasn't very impressed with the art gallery but the view of Seoul from the bldg observation was impressive. Not bad for $12 per person.
9,3.0,"Once the tallest building in Asia, it offers a lot of things to do, aquarium, wax museum, IMAX theater and observation hall at the top. They offer discount if we purchase at least 2 attractions. Beautiful scenery of Hangang Park can be seen from the top and Seoul generally as well. But its aquarium is quite disappointing, not worth money spent."
10,4.0,"There are a few different attractions in Building 63. The main attractions are an aquarium, wax museum, IMAX cinema the lookout on the 60th floor which also doubles as an art museum. You can buy combination tickets to see multiple attractions for a discount. If you are a foreigner/tourist, you can get a further $5 discount on the ticket price. During the day, we hired bikes in Hangang park and then went to City 63 (aka Building 63) in the afternoon to watch the sunset. You can find loads of pictures and some more info on my blog here. http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seoul-hanggang-park-bicycles-building-63.html"
11,3.0,"There is an aquarium, wax museum and observation tower (with art gallery) in this building. It is pretty expensive as far as things go in Seoul and we found other areas were better than this one. The COEX aquarium was more extensive and the views from N. Seoul Tower were much better. If you are in the area it isn't a terrible idea to go but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit as there are other places with better suited to your needs."
12,1.0,"In this building many excursions. But the queues waiting for them long. People are waiting for two or three hours to get only to the Aquarium. We bought a ticket to the observation deck 11000 KRW. Standing 40 minutes in the queue, to rise to the top. And then forty minutes waiting to come down. Spend time waiting in the queue is awful."
13,3.0,"When it was inaugurated I was a kid then and it was a huge sensation. I remember being amazed by the Imax theater. The last time I was there I was with my wife who was visiting Seoul for the first time and we had a good time.I guess if you are new to Seoul, it’s a nice place to visit once. Although you can view all Seoul from the top floors, is not that spectacular because all you see is a sea of buildings. By the way everything there is highly priced."
14,4.0,"There is an art gallery in the last story of the bulding (63, thats where the name comes from). Fair paintings, that are outshine by the best view of the han river, preferably at night, Be aware that there is a 20USD$ charge fir using the elevator."
