0,5.0,"We weren’t sure what to expect from Cookin’ Nanta we anticipated slapstick comedy and people shouting which isn’t far from what it was. They really built a good story and had some hilarious bits in there, there was crowd involvement as well.All in all a really fantastic show and highly recomiendes if you want something different to do in Seoul."
1,3.0,"Show is great for children and I wouldn’t say it was made for adults. Don’t get me wrong - the stunts and precision is amazing and the comedic elements provide much entertainment, but the show gets stale after 30 mins in as it relies on the same 1-2 punch throughout the 90mins. Perfect for families with young kids; not as value for money for young adults."
2,5.0,"Very entertaining, full of laughter and WoW factors throughout the show. Really salute the actors and actress, lots of effort behind the scene."
3,5.0,"The show was something totally new, the actors are great and it's a funny story, well perfomed. Even if you can't speak Korean you are able to understand everything that is going on."
4,3.0,"While the overall show was entertaining, I was disappointed regarding the package that came along with it.  The package included dinner tickets to a certain restaurant, and this restaurant had no indication that it was separate from the theatre itself.  No separate address was listed, only that dinner would be served along with the show.  I felt like this was very misleading and also a waste of money.  The person I went with had to leave the next day, so we did not get to enjoy the full cost of what we spent."
5,5.0,"The show was funny, entertaining and the performers did a good job of interacting with the audience. The theater is fairly small so no matter where you sit, you get a good view of the show."
6,5.0,The Nanta show has lots of slapstick humour with audience interaction. This includes flying props into the audience and inviting audience members to the stage to play mini-games. Side stories like the love story and the rivalry bring more enthusiasm into the feeling of the show. I would recommend going here for a great nighttime treat! 10/10 would go again! (GREEN TEAM IS THE BEST!)
7,5.0,"First watched this in 2013, had so much fun and after 6 years it's still funny and entertaining. Great job!!!"
8,5.0,"I didn't expect this kind of show actually ! it was energetic, nice, fun, and really fun ! I spent, with my family, a really good time!"
9,5.0,I've never laughed so much during a show. It was better than I expected. I really recommend to go and watch it!
10,2.0,"Not funny and excruciatingly long. Did not laugh, only smiled occasionally. Not suited for British humour, much more for Americans with little sense of humour. Was too loud as well."
11,5.0,"The Nanta show was amazing! I wasn't sure what to think because it was non-verbal, but it was hilarious and so well done. We laughed the entire time. All the performers were so charismatic and made the audience feel that we were apart of the show. My brother was called up to the stage! Overall, it was a really fun show and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul."
12,5.0,It's so good! Didn't expect to be that good. Worth the money. Suggest you pay more for the seat so you can get a good view. Highly recommended
13,5.0,"This is a show for all ages.  It started out rather slow and I was a bit skeptical at first but once it got going it was fun.  The performers are so talented and timing is everything with many of their skits.  It definitely kept my attention and when I thought it was over it was not!  For sure, get your tickets ahead of time online.  Prices are much better.  I looked a few weeks out, did not buy, and when I went back they were advertising a special sale if buying tickets during about a three day period so I saved twice!  The show is 90 minutes with no intermission.  They have a small snack bar and also sell a few Nanta souveniers.  The venue was easy to find in Myeongdong and afterwards we were right in the heart of lots of street food to pick for dinner.  I highly recommend Nanta Theater.  A good laugh!"
14,5.0,"Reminded me of Mayumana who is an Israeli dance troupe that combines dance, song and percussion. It was fun, the audience (mainly the VIP ones sitting at front) were asked to join the show, and overall we enjoyed it very much"
15,3.0,"We must watch a show so much. This time is different, kitchen scenery stories and the conflict where possible there in a bit funny way to deliver. I was confuse with the location, it is inside unesco building in the myeongdong shopping street area, NOT in the myeongdong theatre building. Make sure you should arrived earlier in the myeongdong area to enjoy the ambience and find the nanta theatre. I think its overprice, but its an extraordinary experience anyway!"
16,5.0,"A perfect performance.Necessary stop on the evening map of Seoul.Great entertainment, lots of laughter. Perfection in every inch.I definitely recommend it."
17,5.0,Had a fantastic time watching the show. You don't need to understand the language to enjoy the show which is full of loud beats and fun slapstick humour. We bought the cheapest seats and still had a fantastic view of the show. Would really recommend it for a bit of fun.Make sure you get there a bit early if using google maps to navigate as we found it a bit unreliable but thats not the theatre's fault
18,5.0,"If you have enough time in Seoul and you love theatre, it is a must see. It is really funny and entertaining."
19,5.0,entertaining & skillful. plot v simple almost predictable.watch once for the experience.u get discounted  tickets for sunday afternoon shows.theatre is small so sitting half hall or even at the back area is ok
20,2.0,The show was not as good as before.The sound of the knifes hitting the cutting board and the tables was too loud.
21,5.0,This is my fifth time watching the show! Everytime I visit seoul with new friends I make sure to take them to the show! They all like it and find it hilarious no matter their aga or nationality!
22,5.0,"Perfect, second time I visited. Still funny, still good. Only thing is that I didn't find the entrance for the second time. Must be me...?"
23,5.0,I’ve been to this show several times and have loved it each and every time. I recommend spending a little more and getting VIP seats so you are up close

25,5.0,I went (24) with my mother (24++) and we both enjoyed it very much! Left me laughing with tears! They are so professional!
26,5.0,"This show was a lot of fun in a small, intimate room. It is suitable to all ages, a little boy sitting next to us (4-5 years old) seemed to be having the time of his life!"
27,5.0,"This is my second time watching the show. Went with my 79 years old dad and a pair of friends this time. Regardless of age, we all enjoyed the show tremendously. Sitting in between my dad and friends, I could hear their laughter throughout the show. The actors are really good at engaging the audience. Highly recommend if you are visiting Seoul."
28,5.0,Absolutely loved this show. I laughed so much and enjoyed every second. A must see while in Seoul. I pre booked seats online but there seemed to be plenty available on the day to be purchased. I could not recommend this show enough. It is great for the whole family. Children were in the theatre and could be heard laughing and enjoying the show as much as adults. Very little spoken so there is no language barrier. The theatre is quite small so all seats are good.
29,5.0,"It was an exiting evening. I had fun, get involved, heard good music, dance, acting.It was really a good experience."
30,3.0,Went yesterday evening. Temperature outside a been in the teens (F). Enjoyable show that would have been much better if the temperature in the theatre wasn’t in the mi 80s. We were sitting in the mezzanine and it might have been more comfortable had we been sitting in the orchestra. Select your seats carefully
31,5.0,We were laughing from the moment started to the end theater was clean staff were vere coperative actors were super
32,5.0,"The show was amazing, I laughed throughout. The actors have such great skills it is a must see in Seoul"

38,5.0,Went their last year with a bunch of colleagues who were visiting from all over the world and we we all loved it.being back again this year with another bunch of colleagues we went again - again every single one of us had a great time laughing and left amazed and surprised :)
39,3.0,"The performers are skilled and delivery/projection was good.  Maybe I was a bit too jetlagged to fully appreciate the entire performance.  Some parts I found a little bit too silly but if you're in Myeongdong, might as well watch.  It's not too expensive if you book a few weeks before the show and if you stay at Hotel28, they also offer a discount for the tickets."
40,1.0,"Typhoon hit Busan on the day we suppose to return to Seoul. Due to typhoon, all of the flight was cancel and KTX were fully booked. We called the nanta show managment telling our situation and we are willing to pay more if the managment can resechdule our timing but the management were not helpful at all as the only answered they gave us was 'there is nothing we can do'. Its truly a disappointment answer from the management. Nanta show is indeed a famous show but its such a shame their customer service where really bad."
41,4.0,"The performance was great, enjoyable.  Wold recommend.  Only bad thing I can say is the quality of customer service.  Workers have bad attitude."
42,4.0,Light entertainment for the evening. Very funny and great interaction with the public. Would go if you have an hour or two up your sleeves
43,4.0,"Had a quick break from shopping at meongdong to watch this showIt was fast-paced and funny.  so manage to lighten up the day.Performers were good however could show off more skills in the chopping of vegetables.For bookings, it looks cheap but final price includes taxes, etc."
44,5.0,"My sister and I went to this show on a rainy afternoon and we had a blast! It doesn’t matter what language you speak, the show is for everyone. My sister was even brought up on stage during an audience participation part and it was so fun! I highly recommend this show. You definitely won’t be disappointed!"
