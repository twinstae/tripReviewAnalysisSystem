0,4.0,I very much enjoyed going for a run in the area and then later taking a closer look at different aspects of the park.  Examining the different flags and flags of countries that no longer exist was educational.  The park is full of neat statues.  Very family friendly-good place for a stroll.
1,4.0,Its amazing that the area surrounding are still well maintained. The flame is still there! A good walk around the area.
2,5.0,"This park is known as the symbol of the Olympics 1988 in Seoul. It is very big and in the park there are many facilities for exercising such as sporting equipment, swimming pool, and bike road. Many people always come to the Olympic Park to exercise or walk. Also there is a big lake in the middle of the park, and it also has many trees, flowers and grasses, so that people can see great views of a natural environment. The best thing is that anyone can use this park anytime for free. For example, some familes come to have a great time with each other, some couples have a great date in the park, children ride a bicycle with their friends, Also even if you don't have enough time to look around this park, there is a train surrounding the park so you can see all parts of the park with it. In addition, there are many kinds of events. For example there are a lot of performances, art galleries, skating, or concerts. It is located in near Jam-sil Station so it's very convenient to move to another place. I strongly believe all people can get a great experience and valuable time in this park.."

In the Olympic park there are concerts very often. such as singing concert or musical. also in the olympic park they made sports institution very well so many people can enjoy it freely. such as skate board or inline skate things. so around the olympic park always there are heavy traffic.so some people don't go to there because of the time spending. the most important thing is that you can see the 1980 style of the Korea."
4,5.0,"Hello, I live near the Olympic Park in Seoul. If you have any chance to visit Seoul in September or October, I strongly recommend you to go to Baekje Festival taking place at the Olympic park. Olympic park is so wide and always full of so many festivals or activities. In this Hansung Baekje Festival, not only you could experience and learn about Korea's history, but also eat different Korean food!When - October 12th-14thWhere - Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea (near Songpa-gu)Even though the festival will be finished today, I had so much fun at the festival, with so many things to see and try it myself! As the festival happens every year, you really should come here next year. Honestly, the parade, cultural experience, the food, everything I experienced here was so amazing. Can't even describe it with words haha. The festival happens around September or October every year. So those of you who are planning to visit Korea in fall, you SHOULD visit and enjoy this festival! Many services and experiences for foriegners will be prepared as well. Maybe you can even see me- if I work there as a staff or volunteer. Thanks for reading this. Hope to see you there next year! ;D"
5,4.0,"My family and I spent about three hours on a sunny weekday mid-morning at this park, which commemorates the 1988 Seoul Olympics Game.Getting there: We took the subway Line 8 to Mongchontoseong (World Peace Gate) station and came out at Exit 1. This took us to the west end of the Olympic Park where the World Peace Gate is. Alternatively, you could take subway Line 5 to Olympic Park (Korea National Sport University) station and come out at Exit 3; this will be at the east end of the Olympic Park. Entry to the Olympic Park is free.The Park: As we went on a weekday, there was not many visitors, just several locals exercising and relaxing. Hence we had a nice stroll and photograph taking with regular “shade stops” from hot sun. Be mindful that Olympic Park is huge, hence you could opt to take Hodori Train that departs from in front of the Peace Square playground at certain timings (weekdays at 10:30, 11:30, and hourly from 13:00 to 18:00)What we liked:(1)	The calming and peaceful effect of the Olympic Park as most of it occupied by flora (eco-friendly forest, plants, flowers, and sprawling grass fields). (2)	It beautifully integrates history of the Hanseong Baekje period (e.g. Mongchontoseong Fortress) with the modern state-of-the-art sports stadiums and museums.(3)	The following sights: (1) World Peace Gate and the burning fire torch for Seoul Peace Declaration (2) World Peace Square with the flags (3) Sculptures, particularly The Thumb, Dialogue and this dramatic 78 feet high red arc steel sculpture (by Italian artist Mauro Staccioli) that’s shaped like an archer’s bow (4) Mongchonho Lake and the musical fountain (5) Wild Flower Garden (6) One Tree Hill (7) Exhibit of a 430-year-old Protected Tree that is still living with half of its trunk. (4)	Due to the Olympic Park’s proximity to the prominent white Lotte World Seoul Sky Tower, we were able to see the Tower from some parts of the Park.(5)	Walking past several sport facilities, e.g. SK Handball Stadium (Olympic Fencing Stadium), Olympic Swimming Complex and the Olympic Velodrome stadiumWhat we didn’t like(1)	We didn’t have enough time for a few interesting indoor sights that enabled us to escape from the outside elements: K-Pop Music Exhibition Hall (part of the Olympic Hall), SOMA Museum of Art, Mongchon Museum of History, Seoul Baekje Museum.  Did I not say the Olympic Park (2)	During our walk along the Montchontoseong walking paths, we expected to find stone or wall-built castle or fortress physical remnants of the 2.7 km historic Montchontoseong Fortress Wall (built during the Baekje period). Instead, it turned out to be a fortification structure (e.g. bank) that was covered with earth over the centuries.  While we enjoyed walking the Olympic Stadium, we realised that it is competing with so many other attractions in Seoul. If you are keen sports fan and history lover, then Olympic Park is a “must visit”. If not, I recommend you come to Olympic Park if you have the time. And if you do, don't forget that comfortable pair of walking shoes, protection from the sun and lots of drinking fluids."
6,4.0,"The Olympic park is a very impressive leisure facility with legacy from the 1988 games. Nowadays, it is used to relax and unwind by locals."
7,5.0,"Seen from our favorite Korean Hotel, this park is a true fabulous place to check out. It is a bit out of the way so prepare for a bit of a cab ride to get here."
8,5.0,"This park is so incredibly breathtaking, that i felt at peace just by being present and appreciating nature. There are also little gym stops with equipment, where you can do a small workout."
9,4.0,"You probably won't be able to enter the aging Olympic stadium, still bearing the Olympic rings and mascot. But you can still peak inside and see the track where Flo Jo notched four gold medals in 1988, still holding the 200m world record to this day. You can imagine legendary Carl Lewis earning his final Olympic gold medal in an open track event, and a future superstar Michael Johnson battling a fracture that prevented him from qualifying in the 400m, the last Olympics in which few would know his name.You can even see the nearby aquatic facility where Greg Louganis infamously struck his head on the diving board. This Olympic venue is pretty packed with unforgettable moments for those of us who watched it unfold live, and although this is more browsing than in-depth touring, it's still worth seeing the expansive park and an incredibly historic venue decades removed from its glorious past."
10,5.0,The Olympic Park was fabulous! It was well-laid out with various sports venues and was well-marked. The area was clean and accessible for all.
11,3.0,We went there in December. There was nothing there. All the shops were closed. Just a barren land to walk. May be our timing was not good.
12,4.0,This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
13,5.0,"We are visiting Seoul for the first time and although we are trying many of the typical tourist attractions, the Seoul Olympic Park has turned out to be one of our favorite places to visit.  It is off the beaten path and provides a quiet green oasis in urban Seoul.  The imposing entrance at the World Peace Gate is not to be missed, especially at night when kids and parents fill the plaza with bikes and kites and energy.  The small lake is a nice spot to watch birds is the morning as well as an array of citizens exercising.  The hiking paths are plentiful and it is pleasant to hike along with Seoul seniors out for a morning walk.If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle and mingle with the local crowd, it is a great location.  It shows the positive uses that can be made of former Olympic venues."
14,5.0,"The park is big so at least you have to spend a whole day if you want to tour around the whole park. There are a lot of statue in the park, in addition it has museum of art, large greening area. It is suitable for leisure, jogging, biking and picnic etc.,There are many cafe and restaurants inside the park, you can take a break there when you feel tired. The price are reasonable.I strongly advised not to visit there in winter because no tree or plant blossoms. I visited there on 19 March 2017. It was a sunny day, I found very comfortable there, the air was fresh and the park was spacious. At that day, I did not see many tourists, most of the visitors were Korean."
15,1.0,"I have a small disability.Do not be misled that you can take the subway.After you disembark, you need walk a long way.you walk along a huge car park ( Olympic Park South Gate carpark ) and reach a cafe, the brand is starbucks or coffeebean. And the long walk continues. If you are tourist, you would feel lost. Are you here to see the many sports centres, like velodrome, tennis, swimming?They are all separate. In the past, the Gov provided some sort of  "" tour bus""  free of charge ; it went round the park but today I visited the website, this service is not mentioned anymore. Last year I was there on a weekday, the sports centres were closed.The Velodrome was closed. We walked around, wondering how to access.There were some Koreans going in and out of an office in the velodrome building but they would not help.  They were very unfriendly. Later, we found a little gate and we went through that , to see the interior of the velodrome for a few minutes. After that it was a long walk back to the main road. The terrain is not elderly or handicap friendly."
16,4.0,This olympic park has a nice view. You can rent a bike to go around the and see so many beautiful scenery as you paddle.
17,4.0,"We hired a family bike to go round.we thought an hour would be too long,but we could have done with a bit more.had great fun cycling around all the halls that were used for all the different sports.Had lunch in a great buffet restaurant where we tried a lot of local food.It was very reasonable,the only thing,it wasn't on English so you didn't always know what you were eating"
18,4.0,"Sept-2016)  My son and enjoyed the olympic park.  The train from hongik took a while, alot of walking for young children, but we enjoyed the olympic museum and ""Baejke Museum""  (next to the sculpture park)..both were free!  We did not makevitto the SOMA museum or the olympic venues as would have been to much walking for my 8yr old."
19,4.0,The Olympic Park has some nice green areas and still quite a lot of the old Olympic stadiums. It was fun walking around with the current Olympics going on in Rio.
20,5.0,Easy to approach from all different parts of Seoul City.Delicious food restaurants and shopping malls around.Good for stroll around the Park that takes only an hour+.
21,5.0,They have 8 treasure hunts for you to find and stamp.  This made it fun to walk around Olympic Park during the summer.  Lots of art in the park also.
22,4.0,Enjoy a relaxing 4 seaters cycle ride around the park with my kids. See beautiful scrupltures and lots of greeneries. A place to capture wonderful pictures.
23,5.0,"My family really enjoyed the Outdoor Ice Skating.We went on a weekday afternoon, which mean less crowded. It only cost 2000Won per person inclusive of skating shoes & helmet for a good 1 1/2 hrs. Reservation is by block of time.Surrounding area is very scenic,too. There are activities for family cycling, which looks interesting, but, we missed it as it was turning dark by the time we are done with ice skating at about 5pm.There is also the Olympic museum within 2 minutes walk towards the left side from the main entrance. Entrance is free. Last entrance is 5:30pm.Travelling tips : Get off at Mongchontoseong station(Line 8) and take exit 1. You will see the Olympic Arc straight on. The ice rink is located at Peace Plaza inside the park."
24,5.0,"We walked through the park and found tons of stuff to do. We even saw a wedding photo shoot taking place!  There are biking areas, hiking areas and food/shopping.  It's wonderful.  Like everything in Korea, there could be more trash cans."
25,3.0,"This is a nice walk (or you can rent bicycles).  It is a nice park.  Nice sculptures and places to eat.  Not a really big deal beyond that.  it has a lot of history since this is where the 1988 summer games were held, but you can't get into any of the buildings so there is really nothing to do.  You walk around and look at the big stadiums.  If you love a walk in the park, this is for you.  If you are looking to explore the Olympic complexes, that's not happening."
26,4.0,If you decide to visit this place... make sure you are wearing your most comfortable shoes... walking is the name of the game...
27,5.0,"Its a huge park and bicycle can be rented for you to navigate around the park.Landmarks such as the Olympic Fire, Tower etc. are good photo-taking icons."
28,5.0,"Olympic Park is an awesome experience for anyone who enjoys strolling for hours. This park is filled with probably hundreds of sculptures and other permanent artwork to view and photograph...some more interesting than others. There are 2 spots to rent bikes if walking doesn't sound appealing. The main entrance is pretty awe inspiring. The eternal flame burns strong underneath the permanent canopy, with the pavilion opening up to the participant country flags backdropped by an amazing pond with shooting water jet fountains. Photo opportunities abound."
29,5.0,Great Olympic park to visit -- I have been to a few Olympic parks and was really impressed with Seoul park -- Great sculptures to view
30,5.0,Very nice park to visit. Lots to do and a great place to hang out and have a picnic. The outdoor art is really beautiful.
31,3.0,"There is nothing special except very large area for relax walk. You can rent a bike or take a service bus inside the park to look around. However, it is not suitable if you expect an attractive place to visit."
32,5.0,The area was beautiful  Well built and ready for future Olympic Games. The area people are so nice.  Pleasant area well maintained
33,4.0,"The Olympic Park was a nice place to visit.  The park is very big, with many things to do and many sights to see. The best part is, it's free!There are bikes for rent inside the park, there are trains that you can pay to ride on to tour the park, or you can just go on a leisurely walk around to appreciate the plants and giant sculptures adorning the entire park.Vending machines and rest rooms are conveniently located across the entire park.There was a also a very good korean buffet restaurant we went to for dinner, it is called Seasons table, where they serve organic vegetables which they grow.  For the price of 22,900 won, you get to choose from a wide variety of korean food, from appetizer to drinks and dessert.  It is very popular with the locals.  I did not see a lot of foreigners dining there."
34,5.0,"this year's jazz festival was exceptional.  great park and facilities, well managed by a young team of workers who really did a fantastic job keeping everything running smoothly.some good restaurants in the park, and the spring rose festival is impressive."
35,5.0,I love this park. There are many things to see. Around the outside there are loads of cafes and places to eat. You can rent a bike near the entrance. The toilets are clean. I love it in Autumn.
36,5.0,"The place is so big but worth the long walking since the park is very scenic. You can also go picnic, biking, do photoshoot or just sit & relax. The place is still dry when we visited since it's only the start of spring, though I find the place still beautiful. :)"
37,5.0,"If I remember the place correctly, we got to watch the PSY concert here! It was awesome! Other than that, I never really got to go around the area."
38,4.0,"This is an awesome legendary place to be, especially when you have your kids. Take a leisure stroll down the park, luscious trees will provide you shade, benches to rest or have a picnic! And their stadiums are truly majestic!"
39,5.0,The autumn view here is very beautiful. There are lines of gingko trees along the road to the park. In the park there's a lot of maple trees with vivid red colour. Highly recommended for a visit in autumn.There is a Bakje Museum located in the park which just open in 2012. They offer volunteer service which provides free English tour of the museum. I really enjoyed the tour which gave comprehensive information about the Bakje.
