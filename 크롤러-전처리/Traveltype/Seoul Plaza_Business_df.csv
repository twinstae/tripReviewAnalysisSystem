0,5.0,Had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for three days and would definitely stay there again. Food was food and the staff was really nice. I liked that is was really close to a lot of different types is restaurants and things to see. Close the the subway also.
1,5.0,Edward was so helpful in accommodating me to my room. It was so great service that I immediately got into good feeling in Seoul Plaza hotel. Great service and added value for the business traveler.
2,3.0,"Located smack in the center of the city, near City Hall––not the most fashionable or attractive part of Seoul, but convenient if your business in the city makes it so––the Plaza is uneven. The pros first. Great service (I asked for a better and quieter room, and was promptly helped, and I was allowed a late checkout at a very reasonable fee). A good fitness club with a great swimming pool (in another building across the street, but not a big deal). Really comfortable beds. Nespresso machines. Tech all in good order, from water pressure to light commands. Good breakfast. The cons, now. The décor is rather over the top, like a W on steroids. The scent diffused in the lobby is so strong, it is almost violent. The rooms are oppressive, small and all in dark wood, with black carpets––and the walk-in closets are boudoir-fucsia. Unless you get a room with double glass (I got it on my second try) or on a really high floor, the street is noisy. Even though the food was good, the breakfast restaurant was a downer, small and crowded, reminding me of a 3-star hotel during a school trip. Elegance is not the Plaza’s forte but there are many pros, and even though I did not pay because I was a guest of an academic institution, I saw the rates and the quality/price ratio is sensible."
3,4.0,"Seoul Plaza Hotel is very well situated with direct access to shopping areas, Lotte Mall, Myeongdong area and there's also a very nice palace across the street (Deoksugung). The hotel is also very close to City Hall station which is very convenient if you will taking a train going to other places. There are also many good reataurants within easy walking distance. Despite being in the heart of central Seoul, I noticed that the rooms had solid concerete walls that made the rooms maintain the quietness. The staff were friendly and proffesional."
