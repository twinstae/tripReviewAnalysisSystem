1,4.0,Located very close to dongdaemun subway is Migliore which opens at 10.30 in morning and is open till 4.30 am. So one can visit this place in midnight. It’s a must visit place for anyone wanting to buy clothes / accessories or bags. Both male and female clothes available. Shopping tip: remember to bargain - they easily reduce price by 30-40%.Try and shop maximum things from single shop to get maximum discounts
2,4.0,"Migliore is very similar to Hello APM but stall keepers a slightly more snottier. They may have more range in nice styles of clothes but prices are a little higher above 30,000₩.Their B1 floor is stocked full of adorable baby and toddler clothes. A shopping heaven for parents!"
3,4.0,Visited this place as it was the part of culture transit tour. Nice place to shop for souvenirs. Bought some key chains and socks. Bargaining is little hard. Prefers cash as some of them do not have POS machines.
4,3.0,"Each mall contains the same style of clothes (small kiosks like), theres so much stall of the same type of collections makes me feel Ive been entering the same shopping mall. Koreans don't have the habit of bargaining so most items you see are pretty fixed unless you can kindly ask for a discount. Theres a lot of nearby skincare shop that are similar to (the body shop, bath and body works etc) which are pretty affordable and dirt cheap compare back in North America."
