0,5.0,"Although I love the Gwangjang Market, it is extremely busy and tourists tend to make walking through very difficult. This market has delicious food for much better prices. Short rib patties, mandu, famous fried chicken, croquettes, hotteok, fermented stingray, kalguksu and so much more ready-made food. There is even an Isaac's Toast without the busy line. He location is so good if you are near the world cup stadium or Hongdae area. Much better choice for those serious about the food scene!"
1,4.0,Stopped at Mangwon market on a bike tour. A very interesting insight into how local Korean people live. The food was delicious and their speciality is fried chicken although they do have stalls for all manner of different types of food. Itâ€™s relatively inexpensive but I would recommend trying the spicy chicken before you buy a box as it is HOT!!
