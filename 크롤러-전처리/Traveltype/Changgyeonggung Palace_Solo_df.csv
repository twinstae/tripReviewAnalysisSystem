0,5.0,A worthwhile visit after the Gyengong palace.. If you are lucky you will find a cultural event while walking around
1,4.0,"The palace was originally built by the 4th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, King Sejong for his retiring father, King Taejong. It served as residential quarters for queens and concubines. The main building is Myeongjeongmun, the office of the king and it is the oldest of the Joseon Dynasty palaces. There are many palace buildings - royal family rooms, halls & pavilions spread over the compound. What I enjoyed most is the leisure walk towards the greenhouse and its nearby ponds. Tranquil indeed.Besides the main entrance at the eastern side, there is another entrance next to the Changdeokgung Palace Huwon garden. Hence it is best to combine your visit with Changdeokgung Palace and Huwon garden."
2,4.0,A real interesting complex consisting of several 'palaces' build in the 15th century. Good for a stroll of 1.5 hrs and to escape the buzz of the city. Very nicely maintained and the surrounding wall gives a feeling of being out of Seoul
3,4.0,"I was not let down by this site. I generally came here for the serene gardens, walking paths, and old architecture. Along the way I learned about Korean royalty. A must see is the greenhouse here with VERY amazing bonsai."
4,4.0,Cheap entry ticket. Nice cherry blossoms and beautiful garden still in April. Especially the view from the hill was particularly nice!
5,4.0,I enjoyed this palace the gardens are beautiful and the grounds are not to big that you can’t do this in a few hours!!
6,5.0,very huge sprawling palacehas lots of walking spacesbig gardenshas a greenhouse too with rare flowers
7,5.0,"Make sure you see the changing of the guard in all its regalia.  A memorable experience.  Where comfortable shoes..,"
8,5.0,"This one is definitely in my top 3 place you must visit if you’re ever in Seoul. I love this place so much! Even during winter, when everything looks gray, it still looks beautiful! It has this serene feeling. I think I’ve found the place for me to spend time in whenever I’m stressing out."
9,5.0,"First, the price to get in....cheap and well worth it.The buildings are absolutely beautiful. Free English tour guides are available.Don't forget your camera!!"
10,4.0,"In autumn (late Oct./ early Nov.), the trees in the palace turn into yellow and red. The maple trees are particularly attractive and visitors are seen to be busy taking pictures. This year (2018), the maple leaves have turned red earlier than normal. Nevertheless I could still find some interesting ones for my photography. As described under Changdeokgung, it is accessible through a small entrance right at the front of the Secret Garden."
11,5.0,"Very cool place.  Its amazing how minimalistic Korean emperors lived, compared to the Chinese.  Great place to wonder around for a few hours.  Also some very cool demonstrations of changing of the guard!"
12,4.0,A great Palace to visit and very less people around. You can explore at your own leisure.A palace worth your visit.
13,5.0,"I went here in October and there was a holiday on at the time and lots of people, especially the girls were dressed in traditional costumes. Well worth visiting. Seoul is such a beautiful city"
14,4.0,"While this is the 4th most popular palace to visit in Seoul and not the most attractive, it is my favorite due to the attractive landscaped grounds and the peacefulness. Not many people visit here which is very nice. I have been here 4 times, twice during my August visit. It only costs 1,000 Won to enter. It also has a nice pond and greenhouse."
15,5.0,I came here because I was in love with one picture I saw and it delivered what I was expecting. It was sunset when I came so there were only a few people. Only 4 of us I guess. It was serene and beautiful. I'm taking about the one on the other entrance by the way... near the Hongwa gate the one with the pond. I'm just glad that I went there when it was closing because I was able to take in everything and somehow reflect on my Korean journey. ;)
16,4.0,the best way to really enjoy this place is the guided tour!!! you learn so much about the korean history and culture
17,5.0,"You can spend hours walking around the 4 sites, all in center of large city.Forbidden city impressive but this place better, as you can explore all areas.A must see."
18,5.0,This palace is amazing. You need to get around inside them to understand how they used to live. I recommend to wear light shoes so you walk around.
19,4.0,"The palace is right next to Changdeokgung hence it is very convenient. It has some cherry blossom trees as well, although not as beautiful as those in Changdeokgung. At the rear there is a large pond and a greenhouse which seems to be under construction forever (not sure if it will ever open)."
20,5.0,"The palace is not very big but very quite (less tourist), the english tour was really interresting, I was alone so I had a private tour. The grenhouse is really worth a visit."
21,5.0,"Wonderful place to learn a lot about Korean history.  Beautiful buildings and well worth the ticket price.   Take your camera, rain or shine there are lovely photos to be had and it is right in the center of Seoul."
22,5.0,Great place to spend and hour or so looking around. Very beautiful in every season even in the rain.
23,4.0,"The palace is beautiful, but the real must see is the scenic grounds of the palace. There is a green house full of different plants. There is also a small pond that you can walk around. This palace also has access to the Changdeokgung Palace for an additional fee if you didn’t buy the combination ticket."
24,5.0,"Like all the palaces in Seoul, there's nothing actually authentic about this site. It's a modern rebuild of the palace that once stood here, that was either destroyed by fire, typhoon or the Japanese. The stories vary. There's actually not much to see other than many, many buildings. You can't visit any of them inside, only peer through the doors of the ones that are open (and there aren't many) and there's the occasional chair or throne. The grounds are very tranquil and pretty and the architecture is very interesting. You can take guided tours, offered in different languages at different times. Buy the Royal Palace Pass for W10,000 as it's a huge discount for the six sites it covers."
25,3.0,"This palace can be entered from the Changdeokgung palace. But possibly once you leave one palace, you can't re-enter. I suspected not and so did not try.It was designed mainly for elderly members of the royal family, being built in about the 15th century.Because of its purpose, the buildings are smaller than those in the other palaces. The grounds are very wooded and scenic.Sadly when I went the greenhouse, built in 1909, it was closed for refurbishment. However, there are viewing windows to allow people to admire the architecture.Viewing time is about an hour but it is very peaceful walking along the shady paths so you could easily spend longer."
26,5.0,"There are so many, and most of the places are very nice. This is true for the Changgyeonggung palace as well. You might take them one by one, not all of them at once."
27,4.0,"While it is easy to get 'templed out' in a city so rich in tradition and history, Changgyeonggung Palace was a pleasant surprise...set in beautiful grounds with a feature lake and very few visitors at the time... Mid-morning. Well preserved, it is possible to enter into one of the reception buildings, shoes off of course. It is definitely worth wandering the grounds and walking around the lake. This palace can be easily accessed in conjunction with Changdeokgung Palace."
28,3.0,Empty as usual without much to see or do while here. Nothing special sums this place up without being rude.
29,4.0,"As the 3rd palace to be built in Joseon Dynasty after Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, it was originally meant to be the residence of 3 queens due to lack of kiving space at the nearby Changdeokgung. You will notice there are only a few small halls in this palace with non specific layouts. Buildings were positioned to the topography and not strictly aligned in a particular direction. Residential inner halls are bigger and more elaborate than the administration outer halls as the compound was originally intended for residential halls. A combine tour of both palaces is possible but separate ticket must be purchase. Do not miss the Secret Garden. You will need to pay a separate ticket for the Secret Garden of 5,000 Korean Won. Trust me it's so worth it. Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese guided tours are available. Changgyeonggun Palace is close every Monday. If you are taking the Subway, the nearest station in Anguk Station Line 3 and Exit 3."
30,5.0,"Maybe, Changgyeonggung is one of the most beautiful palaces in Seoul. It's smaller than other old palaces like Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung, but I could feel more peaceful mood here. I recommend to visit here on sunny days (when there's no smog!). Walk around and look around those sophisticated Hanoks, take a rest at Tongmyeongjeon (you can actually sit inside if you visit there at day), and go to  as far as two beautiful ponds. Also, you can buy night viewing tickets at the entrance if you have foreign passport. During night viewing, however, they close Tongmyeongjeon so you can't sit inside. ;("
31,3.0,just another palace located in seoul. for me the changdeokgung with huwon secret garden and gyeongbokgung with huge complex way more better than this palace. but still worth a quick visit
32,5.0,"Great place to visit and learn more about Joseon dynasty. The entrance is really cheap and they offer free guided tours at specific hours, which I highly recommend. Take your time and, when you finish the tour, keep wandering around and enjoy this time-travel!"
33,4.0,"For experience, I bought the tickets for multiple palaces and the entry to the secret garden. Good guided tour, the secret garden is probably a great beauty if it was spring. It was still freezing cold, the ponds were frozen and tree were bare."
34,5.0,Another fantastic dramatic place to visit.The size of the buildings takes your breath away.Free entry over 60s
35,5.0,This was a great day looking around at the palace even though it was pouring rain. This is a must see and plus it is a world heritage site.
36,3.0,This was my third Palace and I was getting a bit palaced out. The restoration was not quite as good. The paint work was not so impressive and some of the panels were just plain red. The decorations inside the buildings no so impressive. If you are in Seoul for a while the sure put it on the itinerary but keep it down the lower end of the too list.
37,3.0,"Located side-by-side with Changdeokgung and ""slightly less grand"" in stature than that palace (by stature, I mean the overall size of the palace grounds & the number of buildings on the premises; and yes by those measures, both of these palaces are ""way less"" in their statures than the main palace Gyeongbokgung), there's really nothing much to see at this palace except for its main palace building with the throne stage inside which can only be looked at from right outside the big room just as at all the other palaces (except at Deoksugung where the main building can be entered for a close-up view of the throne stage).  One thing you might like to do here though which cannot be found at the other palaces (except at Changdeokgung's Secret Garden although not quite the same because that's a ""guided tour"") is a nice stroll on your own at your own pace in the wood right beside the main palace building (just go out the corridor on the left side while facing the main palace building), and also another ""unique thing"" I noticed at this palace is a building on the palace grounds that people can actually go in and sit down on the floor for a good rest if you so wish (no such building on palace grounds ""for resting"" can be found at any of the other palaces!).Coming by subway, Jongno 5-ga Station (on line 1) is where to get off followed by about a 15-minute walk north to get here, but this palace really should be done ""in conjunction"" with Changdeokgung (specifically by using the ""back exit"" of Changdeokgung right beside its Secret Garden entrance which will lead to the high ground overlooking the grounds of this palace & where there are stairs to come down); and the nearest metro station for Changdeokgung is Anguk (on Line 3) from which it's just about a 5-minute walk straight east on the big street Yulguk-ro to the entrance gate of Changdeokgung.And what I suggest for the ticket is just getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won (the equivalent of 10 US dollars) which is good for like a month and which covers this palace & three others (namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung & yes Changdeokgung right beside this palace as mentioned above) plus Jongmyo Shrine also just in the vicinity of this palace; just do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays, and the main palace Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays."
38,5.0,This is a nice palace.  lots of Korean architecture and a nice lake.  this is a pretty big place.  it can be  crowded but once you get out farther and you come to the lakes it is peaceful.  there are a few people.  it is very beautiful grounds so bring a picinic and be prepared to take lots of pictures the grounds are are clean and safe.  There is also a greenhouse the you can explore and look at  the Korean plants and flowers. Koreans come hers and have their photos taken for engagement or marriage.
39,3.0,On a sunny day this is a great place to check out all the areas of this palace. Several different buildings and color arrangements. Also a convenient gift shop and coffee shop located inside.
40,5.0,"I visited the palace in late Oct. 2016 after visiting the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung. There is an entrance to Changgyeonggung right next to the Secret Garden entrance. This is very handy ie without having to go around a long way to the main entrance of Changgyeonggung. In autumn, the place is stunning with trees changing colours. There are two ponds at the rear worth visiting. The greenhouse is under renovation so I shall see it another time. The palace buildings are not so grand but the garden is great. One should see the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung and the Changgyeonggung together for a full experience of autumn palace beauty. For the former, one needs good planning ie to book the ticket 6 days in advance on internet (and you have to be quick as the bookings are all gone in 15 minutes or so, and the website is heavily jammed at those times)."
41,3.0,"It's very small, not that much to see, I spent 30 minutes here, it's enough. If you don't have that much time in Seoul, this one can skip."
42,5.0,"This beautiful palace was built for 3 Queens by King sung. The entrance fare is 1000 krw. Taking the line 4, exit 3 or 4 of Heahwa Station."
43,5.0,"The grounds of this palace are absolutely beautiful. The buildings are lovely too, and have a lot of interesting history about them. I enjoyed spending a couple hours in the morning walking around here."
44,5.0,After my trip to Japan the palace here was kinda disappointing. Not much to see. Rhe garden however was very beautifull. You can definitly spent some time walking there and enjoying the nature.
45,5.0,"I had been walking for a long time in the busy streets of Seoul and decided to give it a try - paid 1000 won and entered a beautiful palace. Automatically you are cut off from the traffic outside and surrounded by nature and serenity, plus once more beautiful architecture from the past. Basically is you are looking for a place to walk around in nature where architecture is present as well - this is the place to go."
46,5.0,"I wanted to express my humbe opinion about this place..( SEOUL..) THIS IS A GREAT PLACE FOR SHOPPING/SIGHT SEEING ,FOOD !!! the palaces are not less impressive than the Tokyo ones..the markets are better than the Honk Kong ones... The food is great... ( cant compare here... every place has its own ""specialty""..."
47,3.0,"Changgyonggung Palace is minutes away form Changdeokgung Palace.  Changgyongung is smaller and doesn't have as many interesting things to see as Changdeokgung.  I didn't go on the guided tour so it's possible I would've enjoyed it if a guide explained the grounds to me.  Since it's so close to Changdeokgung, I think it's worth a visit and would be better if you can join one of the guided tours."
48,5.0,This palace is connected to Changdeokgung near an entrance by the Hiwon (secret garden) area in the aforementioned location. It is similar to other palaces in that it has a wide expanse of land it claims. You'll need at least an hour and a half to walk around and see everything. The real treat was the Victorian style green house tucked away in the back. It was under construction when I visited but they had a lovely garden nearby you could walk through as you walked around the pond on the palace grounds. The buildings are somewhat understated when compared to Changdeokgung and Gyeonbokgung but it still has an austere beauty and charm to it that shouldn't be missed.
49,5.0,"I visited on a Sunday morning when there were no school visits, and the weather was perfect.  A lovely place."
50,4.0,"This palace and gardens is beautiful in Spring. There are many flowers blooming, and plenty of old trees. The palace itself has some beautiful painting work but otherwise isn't very interesting, but the walk through the gardens made it worthwhile. Very peaceful in the middle of Seoul. There were a lot of school groups there when I visited (9.30am) but it didn't put me off as they were pretty well behaved. Entrance costs 1000 won (about $1.10 AUD) which is super cheap."
51,5.0,"just beautiful, rich history, and wonderful gardens. would love to return with my grandparents to show them."
52,5.0,"Well suggesting English One Guided tour twice a day, is nothing compared to the number of people and the attendance all the time, i was fortunate i didn't get a Guide, so done the tour, then the search later on by my own"
53,5.0,"This place should probably be at the top of everyone's to do list in Seoul. However, this palace is only one of several that span about 2 or km back. If you want to see all the palaces and the grounds be sure to allow at least half a day, if not more. Also, be prepared for lots of walking. But it's all worth it because the ceremonies and palaces are so very unique!!!!!"
54,4.0,"It is a small palace in Seoul. It's used to be part of Changdeokgung palace. These two palaces is quite far from the subway (but still in walkable distance). For those who don't want to walk uphill, I recommend to visit these palaces in the same day. First --> Changdeokgung, then go through the small gate (near the secret garden entrance) to the Changgyeonggung. You can go by the subway and then get on the bus (with T money card, there is no bus fare). There is a small number of visitors in this palace. So you can find peace when wandering around. It has a 1-hr free guided tour (two times a day). The guide will wear traditional ""Hanbok"" and wait for the tourists near the bridge inside the gate. She speaks fluent English. I visited this palace 4 times in 2 years. I think guide tour is better than walking around on your own."
55,5.0,"located city center, this huge complex has several most impressive buildings, temples, shrines that keep one's feet aching for a day to see it all......."
56,5.0,"The historic context behind this palace is unmistakable - this is the 3rd palace compound to be built in the Josen dynasty.  Beyond the standard palace architecture and facade, there's a expansive garden attached to the palace which used by many locals as their ideal location to chat under the shady trees.  There's a large lake at the end of the gardens which provides a great setting for Instagram photos.  That is why you'll need more time to cover every section of this palace."
57,3.0,"It is very difficult to pin this place down as a sight; it is as much wooded trails and a lake as it is a palace.  The palace is, itself, very low key - almost like an afterthought.  There are no buildings worthy of special mention, although is set amid a quite pretty, hilly landscape.As you venture northeast, you suddenly find yourself amid hilly, wooded trails which beckon you to follow them.  There is a very pleasant, nice sized lake replete with an island and a resident heron of some sort.  Heading further on, you will come upon a white, atrium-style hothouse with an assortment of flora.If it were wrapped up in the admission fee for Changdeokgung Palace, one might be able to stretch this to a 4 star attraction but it’s their insistence on a separate entrance fee that lands it squarely in the “Average” category."
58,4.0,"Palace within another palace ground , I consider this a lived-on palace being built for a Queen and a retired King Taejo. Nice to walk in , compact and within the Anguk area."
59,5.0,"Seoul does such a wonderful job maintaining and integrating life around these great palaces.  This one is no different.  And it is in easy walking distance from Gyungbuk palace (big one near blue house), insa-dong, bukchon, etc...Make it part of a great day in Seoul"
60,5.0,"This is not the main palace, but I think Changgyeonggung is the most beautiful, well-organized palace. Never miss it. Also it is well-preserved. You can take a walk along the palace."
61,5.0,"I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded."
62,3.0,"I visited all of the palaces and this one was the only one to show signs of age - lots of peeling and fading paintwork and a few buildings completely surrounded by scaffolding for restoration works. There is nothing unique about Changgyeonggung Palace as it has the same layout of entry gate, courtyard, throne room and outbuildings as all of the other palaces do. It is only worth a visit if you are nearby, are really interested in Korean architecture/history or need to fill in time in your itinerary."
63,5.0,"I was lucky because I was there when there was a little reenactment about the daily life of the palace. We had to write our name in a wooder ID card and showed it to the guard before entering the gate. The king, the queen, the guards... they looked really real, and played really well. I've been there 2 times, and the 1st one I joined with the tour and she explained the palace really well, about the philosophy of the palaces, about the differences between the building for the woman and any other building. Nice."
64,4.0,"Cool palace.  One of the smaller ones, so less crowded, but still cool to check out.  I believe this is where the changing of the guard begins as it moves through the city to the main palace."
65,4.0,"I visited this Palace (along with the neighbouring Changdeokgung Palace) at the end of November 2014 whilst on a work related trip to Korea.  In my opinion this Palace is not as beautiful or a grand as it's neighbour but it does have more of a tranquil feel to it as you walk it's tree lined paths.  Entrance to Changgyeonggung Palace is very cheap at KWon 1,000 (about GB£0.60) and hence great value!You can also walk north of the Changgyeonggung Palace in the lovely 'Changdook Park' to the 'Changgyeonggung Greenhouse (Daeonsil)'.  This is a large Victorian Glasshouse, built in 1909 next to an ornamental lake, that is home to some amazing plants... Well worth a visit."
66,5.0,"I'd had a shockingly bad experience when I was in Seoul. After I was kind of wandering the city a bit of a mess, and I got off the tour bus at Changgyeonggung Palace without really thinking about it. At first I thought it was just a big court yard with a couple nice buildings around it, but the longer I stayed the more I realized the place is HUGE there's so much to see and lots of hidden little places which are beautiful to sit and enjoy the surroundings. I spent a long time walking through the trees out the back section and winding through the Palace building, it was so peaceful. Helped me get over my not so great encounter: PVery lovely stop if you're on a city tour bus! Recommend it"
67,5.0,I learned quite a bit about the ancient royalty of Korea from the guide showing us the palace. I went in Winter time which was a mistake since the tourist parts are all outdoors. Aside from that it was a wonderful attraction.
68,5.0,I walked form my hotel Ramada Hotel and Suites Seoul Namdaemun to they Palace took around 45 min but as in winter I love to walk and can see different kinds of shops and attractions. Lucky when I reach there they had there guard changing ceremony it was super the hole Palace took around 1 and half hours to finish but if you don't like history please don't visit .
69,5.0,I visited the palace with my son's fiance who is Korean. She gave me a wonderful tour of the palace. The sense of history was overwhelming. The grounds were so beautiful and well maintained.
70,5.0,"It was my last palace to visit, I wanted to give up as I could not reached it (no time, or eng tour time was over). But on my last day I visited this nice place, there were a lot of local people with their family and other half. Really nice place though!"
71,4.0,"Smaller compared to other royal palaces in Seoul. It was actually part of Changdeokgung palace but later separated. Its entrance and main hall survived the Japanese invasion of Korea in 20th century and hence unlike the other buildings in all 4 royal palaces of Seoul, these two structures are original and very old. Another distinction of this palace from the other is its direction. Other palaces face south but this palace faces east. The pond inside the palace is built by the Japanese and the locals call this pond as the ""tears of Korea"". Also it is not in Korean style (Korean ponds have rectangular shapes with round isles in the middle of the pond). For adults, admission fee for Changgyeonggung is 1000 KRW But if you buy a combined ticket for royal palaces which is valid for 1 month you will pay 10000 KRW and with this ticjket you will be able to visit Changdeokgung, Huwon, Changyeonggung, Gyeongbokgung, Deoksugung and Jongmyo Shrine. A very good deal if you have a few days in Seoul."
72,4.0,"One of the many palace in Seoul. Changdeokgung is just next to it, and connected (but separate admission fee)More in my blog: http://photofreak-alvinz.blogspot.sg/2013/02/korea-trip-25-jan-4-feb-2013.html"
73,3.0,I visited the ChangGyeongGung on late fall 2013 and the colors of autumn was still so vibrant. I would say that it's okay to visit this palace but if you plan on visiting all the palaces in Seoul you might want to skip the guided tour and just take the one in the main palace. here's my ChanggeyongGung experience: http://brownmantrips.com/?p=5830
74,5.0,"The temple is peaceful, you can go around with a lot of local, you can pray and you have a nice view over the city."
