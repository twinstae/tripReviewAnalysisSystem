Free food provided for visitor who gamble here. Workers here are mostly polite. Nice place to visit to kill some free time."

2,2.0,Very small casino and very crowded on the weekends.  There are not a lot of poker dealers so you have to wait hours to play.  The automatic order machines for food were both out of order so you cant order food at the time because you cant order directly to the waitresses.  Managers are unable to speak other languages but yet no Koreans are allowed it is for foreigners only so why not speak other languages?  Not a good casino don't waste your time or your money.

Slot machines are joke, but if you want to gamble for few hours and have some fun with your buddies, this is it!  I have to say, the casino staffs looks so bored and unfriendly.  I find that the worst thing about these dealers is that they make stupid comments to each other about the players and criticize how these low life players are.  I'm Korean but I find that these low level staffs are not adequately trained have no idea about good customer service. They should smile more and treat players better."
4,3.0,Usually it's reay crowded but if you are lucky enough to sit down its great! The service was really good and the staff is still amazing. However they give you just average food for free it used to be really good.Drinks used to be complimentary but now it's just juice and beer.
