0,5.0,"We trudged through Seoul's huge Gwanghwamum Square, looking at its offerings, and noted an entrance to this museum behind the big statue of King Sejong. As we knew nothing about this king nor Admiral Yi Sunshin, we decided to enter. The museum is divided into two big exhibition halls in the basement of Sejong Center. Information on King Sejong is presented in the west wing with the admiral featured in the east wing. A section containing a library, gift shop and snack shop separates the two halls. We found the museum to be nicely curated and filled with fascinating exhibits about these two extraordinary men.King Sejong (1397-1450) created Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. A scholar, he contributed to the development of science, music and technology in Korea and expanded its territory. His story is told through a multimedia approach. Children seemed to be interested in many of the displays and lined up to sit on the replica of the king's throne. Admiral Yi Sunshin (1545-1598) led the Battle of Myeongnyang, defeating the Japanese Navy in the Imijin War. No fan of military history, I still became quickly engaged with the displays, which include his naval battles and the tactics used as well as weapons and artifacts used in battles. For me, the piece de resistance proved to be the replica of a Turtle Ship, which earned the name because its roof vaguely resembled a turtle's shell. Created by the admiral, this vessel was the world's best assault ship of the time. It easily sank enemy ships because of the ability to fire at close range.I think that history buffs would find this museum to be well worth visiting. It is easily accessed by bus and metro lines. Open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., it is closed on Monday. Admission is free."
1,5.0,What a fascinating piece of Korean history! Deep below his statue in the heart of the city is a very well curated history of this wonderful leader and the story of how he developed a new language for his people. Experience such as this one are why we travel!
2,4.0,"The statues of these two very important figures in the history of Korea are spectacular, and are located in Gwanghwamun Square.  I've reviewed the statues and posted photos on their respective TripAdvisor sites, and mentioned this place too. The fearsome Admiral Yi Sun-Shin also gets space in the War Memorial of Korea, which has a very large replica of his ""Turtleship"", which had a studded roof to prevent boarding by the Japanese navy.But under Gwanghwamun Square is a - museum I guess I'd call it - depicting the stories behind Admiral Yi and Sejong the Great King whose statues sit above.  It's worth looking for the entrance in the Square.You can learn more about these historical figures and their achievements in this display.  Both were extraordinary, larger-than-life characters.  No wonder they are so remembered in Korea.  There's even a 2014 movie about Admiral Yi - called ""The Admiral""."
3,4.0,"I'll freely admit I know very little little about Korean history, but I learned more about Admiral Yi and King Sejong in these two free museums and their influence on the development and history of Korea than I thought possible. They are revered by Koreans. King Sejong is the Father of Korea, an innovator and an innovator. Much was done to advance Korea in many ways under his rule.Admiral Yi was a naval hero who fought off the Japanese invasion and while seemingly outnumbered he saved the day and forced the Japanese navy to retreat! Wow, what a man!There's a wonderful FREE (pick up a ticket in advance at the booth outside) 4D movie you can watch about the famous battle. Yes, 4D. You'll wear 3D glasses but your seats will also move and (well, I don't want to spoil the surprise) let's just say it's a naval battle and water is involved!Very fun discovery right on the plaza. We found it educational and entertaining!"
