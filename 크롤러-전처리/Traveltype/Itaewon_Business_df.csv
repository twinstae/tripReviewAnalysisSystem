1,5.0,"Bars and good music, I was there with a business friend to have a beer and we found this area great for young night life with bars and restaurant. If you want to feel Seoul young night life you must go there. Surly I’ll return."
2,5.0,"i liked the sleepless nights there..24 hour walking street, so free of people all around the world. if you want a place that really want to feel at home and people friendly around,find it here"
3,5.0,"Itaewon is close to former/ existing US army Headquarter. Most shop owners/ keepers command good English for this reason. Itaewon has variety of restaurants + interesting shopping areas, socks, shoes, cloths, leather garments, goods, souvenier, hats, caps, scarves, jewellery, watches etc."
4,5.0,"I've been coming to Seoul for well over ten years and can remember Itaewon as a rather sleazy area, frequented mainly by GI's given it's proximity to the US Army base at that time. Since the Americans moved out of the city, the area has seen massive development and now hosts a wide choice of bars and restaurants in the area around the Hamilton Hotel on Itaewon itself, and the pedestrian road behind. Most bars are reasonably priced, offering a more affordable option outside of the main tourist hotels. It is the place in Seoul to spend an evening - well worth a visit !"
5,3.0,"To enjoy this place you need energy, and some money . I would have liked much more at the time I went to Rimini, or Fengirola and Torre Molinos ( I was 20 and 24 ... ). Very young population around and the style is ... drink, have fun, shop something just to fill up the time, ... drink, eat, have fun ."
6,5.0,Good tourist street full of tourists and shops. You can find many things and also international food here
7,4.0,Probably the only 'multi-cultural and diverse' place in Seoul. Many restaurants and pubs/bars  serving international cuisines and drinks. Good area to have a walk around and explore the souvenir shops.
8,5.0,"The DYNASTY tailor was highly recommended by friends for decent price of quality suit in Itaewon. because my body shape is not like a normal built which is a very broad shoulder with thick arms so none of rack suit fits me at all. that's why I definitely need a custom fitted suit so I went this tailor ordered 3 suits and 5 shirts. The suits and shirts turned out so fabulous!! They fits me like a glove and quality was fantastic! and they solved long term of my chronic trouble of attire at once.And I would purchase more suits from this tailor by online because they keep my very accurate pattern on file. lastly I would like to say, It is quite true as I have heard that."
9,4.0,"This part of Seoul has a little something for everyone.  Located near the US army base, it has shops, food, and stores that can customer make almost anything for you.  You want to avoid some sections due to the adult entertainment that is offered but during the day it is a nice stop with lots of choices."
10,4.0,"The variety of shops and range of goods is mind boggling !  Within three days of the first fitting of bespoke suits / tailoring, we were back to get the final fitting for trouser length etc. Outstanding values and a unique way to experience the market driven economy of Korea. Women's fashions a la Vogue available for customs tailoring too."
11,4.0,"Filled with many expats here, so it's fairly easy to find food that aren't originally from Seoul. (Eg. Indian or Moroccan cuisines can be found easily here, great for muslims). I was advised by my Korean friend that it isn't 100% safe for female solo travelers to come here as it is populated with more male expats than female- they will really check you out so, wear modestly and best to explore with a friend :)"
12,4.0,"If you're a first timer to Korea,this place is a must. For a muslim traveller like myself ,it is easy to find a halal food in this area. There are a lot of shops here as well from T''shirts to all kind of souvenirs. But just take note, most of this shop's close after 6pm. You must plan in advance and don't go there for shopping at night."
13,2.0,I heard a lot about Itaewon and all the market areas they had to offer. Maybe I would have had a better experience if I was travelling with somebody who knew the area. It was tough to navigate around and very easy to get lost once you go into some of these shopping areas. It was a bit dirty and all the stores primarily had the same stuff. I’m not big into haggling for stuff and hate to be coheres into going into stores.
14,4.0,international street that mostly you can see tourist from all around the world is here..big sizes for the shirts and dresses can be find here..and mostly the food here is halal...so is good for muslim to visit here.
15,4.0,"Was in Seoul for a month over Christmas and was getting a little home sick (western culture). I love the Korean culture, food and people but needed a little taste (and some English) of home far away.Itaewon was the perfect ""escape"". It has expats that i could speak with and talk about home and eat French Frys over a Pint! The nightlife was fun and exciting as the street(s) are all walking with restaurants and pubs. I even found an Outback Steakhouse!Only needed about 2 days/nights then back to the great culture of Korea."
16,3.0,You will see a lot of Westerners but is that why you travel?  There are some nice restaurants serving western food.  The only plus is after night falls - this is the locale for enjoying the bars and clubs until dawn.
17,5.0,"The place where everyone hangs out. From its (in)famous hooker hill (adorned by a mosque on top) to the many diverse restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Also some great bargain shopping. But overall, a cool place to hang out."
18,4.0,"If you are looking for shopping that is not hampered by language difference, try shopping in the Itaewon district of Seoul.  Most of the shops are run by Koreans who have a good grasp of the English language.  The sales people are typically ""hard"" sell and prices usually are negotiable.  The bargains are not as great as they were 20 years ago, but there are still some good buys out there...happy hunting!"
19,5.0,There was so much shopping available in Seoul.  Most places sported the hig priced designer shops.  Itaewon had local vendors of such variety - I did not do the district justice.  Plan on 3-4 days if you like shopping and bargaining.
20,5.0,Great place to go if you are ocidental. They have good options of restaurants and stores. It is a nice place to visit.
21,4.0,"This is a must visit for Muslim people. Beside the Itaewon Mosque, the surrounded area provides many choices and variety for 'halal' food. I found one Indonesian restaurant here, and the rest is Arabian or Indian cuisine. The taste is good."
22,4.0,"Shopping by day, partying at night. Another shopping mecca that I did not find so unique. Not worth the hype but seems to come alive after dark with all the American themed discos and even a reggae bar!"
23,4.0,"From the buying perspective, this is not unlike a beach in Mexico. Everyone has something to sell and they will ask you multiple times.  The prices are ok...but not great.  Tailored shirts run about $50 US.  Quick turn a round."
24,2.0,"you can skip this area, certainly not for shopping, which is better done in Meyondong.Hardly a 1km of shops, where you can notice westerns at last."
