0,4.0,"It overlooks the Hangang river and as the name suggests, it has 63 floors - and is the tallest and most recognisable building in Korea. It is not just a tall building and houses attractions such as Seaworld and an observatory on the 60th floor."
1,5.0,You can see Han River from the top.There us an aquarium in the basement. It's not so big but there is a mermaid show.
2,5.0,The night view at here is quite great. it is a wonderful experience stay in 63 tower for 1~2 hour. Very convenient to visit there by taking the subway or bus. You can go there at night when after dinner.
3,3.0,"I didn't now what to expect. There are not so much inside to do. We've been there on a rainy day. The galleria was closed. We visited the aquarium aqua planet which is nice and artifully displayed but it is more for small children. The aquarium is relatively small. Shops were not very interesting. At sunset, the 63 building is shimmering with the sun (this was not at this rainy day). So it is better to see it from outside."
4,5.0,Seoul is a huge city and this building allows for a great view of it along the river. This is well worth a visit.
5,4.0,"This is a very popular atraction in Seoul. It has an elevator which takes you to the roof, where there is an observatory. The city view from there is wonderful. At the ground floor there are many restaurants with good options of different kind of food."
6,5.0,"We went up to the top of the 63 building only to find buildings, buildings, and more buildings. There were so much condominiums and it was a bit hazy due to the smog but it was a really awesome view. There is a small coffee shop so you can rest a bit. There is also a small gift shop to buy little gifts."
7,1.0,Everything is closed down. Waste of time. Going to other places of attraction would be more worthwhile
8,4.0,"View from this tallest and most recognized building in Korea is much better than fromthe Seoul Tower.Enter via 63 Square, they do charge an entrance fee of 13000 won for adult...There is a cafe where you can sit, relax and enjoy the view."
9,4.0,"Let me tell you about 63building in Seoul.63building is 249m high. You can go there by train, bus and taxi. You can take 6B or 10B bus from Incheon International Airport. It leaves every 1hour. If you want go by train. You can go underground airport than you'll find train station. But you'll arrive there after 1hour.The 63building started to be built in 1985. It took a long time. But many people visit 63building. Because there are many shopping malls, cinemas, an aquarium, restaurants and company offices. But there many expensive stores.What you especially want to see is the fantastic view. It is on the top floor. But it's not cheap too! It is 13,000won. If you go to the top floor you'll see Yeouido city. Also you can go to the Thrill Deck corner. The floor is made of transparent glass. Opposite there is Art Mall corner. There many pictures also the pictures change once a month. I think 63building is very good but it is a little expensive."
10,5.0,"After walking the River, I saw this building and remembered it from many Korean variety shows I had watched in the past. They offer a foreigner discount which was a pleasant surprise. There was no wait, which was even better. Once we got to the top, it offered great views. No complaints on my end."
11,4.0,"The building itself is now fairly old, over 30 years, but it hasn't really aged at old, thanks to its cladding that make it look like it's a gold lingot (especially when the sun in low in the sky). Even more so than for foreigners, it is a veritable symbol of Korea, as one Asia's tallest building, and defined Korea as a rapidly emerging country. The attractions Inside are various (art gallery with observatory, wax museum, aquarium, shopping mall). Apart from the observation deck, the other attractions are ""only"" decent, and there are better wax museums in Northern Seoul - Gr√©vin, better malls in many places -IFC mall also in Yeouido, Times Square...- and better aquarium at COEX or at the Lotte World Tower. So the main reason to visit would be going all the wait up to get a great view, and also enjoy a nice art collection. The view is indeed really nice, and without a doubt the best spot for a panoramic view of the Han river. However, it does come in pricey (20 000 KRW I believe), which might not warrant the price for some people. If you want to come up an equally expensive tower, Namsan Tower might be a bit more iconic, and climbing some mountains in Seoul (Inwangsan, Bugaksan, Gwanaksan, Guryongsan, Namsan) might give you an almost as beautiful spectacle as well, but for free."
12,5.0,"They have the observation deck, wax museum, art museum, aquarium and seasonal attraction for kids there. There is a small, pricey shopping area and nice food court. Mainly, the view from the building and nearby park is why I went. There is a free shuttle to the building from nearby stations for free."
13,5.0,"This tower should be preferred to the N tower. While it is not as high, the top floor is much quitter and also propose some nice modern art exhibition. The other activities proposed in the tower (aquarium, wax museum) is nice specially for families and is the weather is not that great."
14,3.0,"Pretty much a pointless mall/building that has a very good view of Seoul.Paid 11000 KRW to go up to the observatory. At that moment, they had an art exhibition at the observatory so one can browse works of arts while admiring the city view. Amazing view of the Han river and downtown buildings can be seen. Best time to go would be around 6-7pm for sunset.There is also a small cafe and a souvenir shop.A note is that the building is a little far from nearby subway stations (Yeouido & Yeouinaru) but the building provides free shuttles leaving every 20 or so minutes to and fro."
