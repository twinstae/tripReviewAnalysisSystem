1,5.0,"EXCELLENT shopping areas. The surroundings are like in old-fashioned houses but when you stepped into the shops, WOW! All high-end interior. Very comfortable to shop and pleasant to look around. We enjoyed our time here! Prices may be a little steep but its a really great place to hop around!"
2,5.0,"This road has plenty of interesting looking shops, great cafes and restaurants and heaps of cool art galleries. It is close to Gyeongbokgung Palace and some tourists wander around here in their rental hanbok outfits. It's a very chilled place to spend a few hours."
3,4.0,It is a nice area to visit very unique area but the quality of the food at the restaurants are not very desireable.
4,4.0,Must visit this place for photo taking.  There is a a lot of cafe and street foods here.  A very famous nian-gao restaurant is here.  Do not miss the restaurant if you are here! very delicious and reasonable price.
5,5.0,"June was very rainy, so take transparent umbrella:), you should start from from Gyeongbokgung Palace, you will pass many shops, restaurants, galleries and nice old style houses."

7,5.0,"Littered with Artsy places and cafes, the streets itself has so much character and always something interesting to find. Explore on your own and be curious of the surrounds, you'll definitely find something interesting."

10,5.0,"A quaint little neighbourhood with lots of boutique cafes (coffee, desserts) and restaurants, and boutique shops.  Can easily visit this place in the same morning/afternoon as Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon, and Insadong."
11,4.0,"Good to take a break at the cafe after visited Bukchon Village. Sit at top floor of the cafe can view far, relax to have a afternoon coffee break with ice cream waffle ...Saw quite a few ladies dress up in korean traditional costume walking on the street then realise u can rent the costume from the shop."
12,5.0,This meandering nice road is excellent for a stroll after your visit to the Gyeongbokgung Palace.It is very nice during the dusk and is full of restaurants.
13,3.0,"It's a fairly short road and connects the side gate of the Palace with Bukchon Village so if this is on your itinerary I would definitely use it as my means of walking. Great place to enjoy a coffee or tea at one of the local cafes... There are some brand name retailers here as well as some local quirky independent shops, might be worth a quick poke around if you have an extra 1/2 or full hour. But in it's own right, not a destination, really..."
14,5.0,"We walked down here from the bukchon village on our way to Insadong and found this area thoroughly charming! It feels abit different from the online pictures somehow. It was a chic and expensive area obviously, but quite peaceful eventhough being right at the bottom of Bukchon Village. I felt like I was in Soho NYC walking here. Lovely area!"
15,5.0,4pm on a beautiful autumn day after a visit to the East Palace. Took a nice spot on the 3rd floor Terrace and it was utterly perfect. Nice view and a wonderful vibe. Perfect place at the perfect time. Coffee and dessert was also good.
16,5.0,"Plenty of restaurant choices, if you are looking to shop for Seoul specials - lot of boutiques within reasonable price range."
17,4.0,"Went to samcheongdong-gil road with my boyfriend for a walk and sightseeing. It is a mixture of the traditional and modern side of korea. You will notice a lot of locals as well as tourists around the area.There are a lot of cafes, shops, restaurants and more along the street. Walked passed a lot desserts cafes and I felt like buying and trying all of the different types of desserts (because they simply look so tempting and tasty), but I couldn't (because it is too much to try everything). Bought cream cheese churros from ""IQ84 Churros"" and had our lunch at one of the restaurants nearby. Other shops sell products like clothes, accessories and etc. They are all nice but I couldn't go in to every shop.Apart from that, when you walk to a particular area, you will notice a lot of police patrolling and guarding the area. The reason is because the president is living nearby (The Blue house).In all, Samcheongdong-gil road is located near Anguk station, nearby hanok bukchon village. It is a good location for phototaking and we even encountered foreigners having wedding photoshoot at the area in this cold winter. Cool! After taking a walk at this road, we went to hanok bukchon village for another round of sightseeing. Do not miss this road if you are just nearby or around Anguk station. In fact, there are a lot of other attractions around Anguk station such as Insadong, Gyeongbok palace, Changdeok palace, Gwanghwamun, etc. Nice!"
18,3.0,A short walk north from the National Folk Museum is Samcheongdong-Gil Road.  You look around and see all of the Hanok rooftops and realize these buildings are converted to cafes and shops.  Great to walk through although you might go up the wrong street but fun to see at least once.
19,4.0,"A nice walk after visiting the Bukchon area. This road is filled with cafes, restaurants, galleries and the like. The ginkgo trees on both sides of the road turned yellow when I visited, making the street photogenic. This appears to be popular with locals and tourists and can rather crowded."
20,4.0,"Not subway line here but you can walk your way in, coming from Korea's Folk Museum. Excellent coffee shops, clothing stores, and designer stores too. Many restaurants offer good and not so expensive menus for your taste. Try the green tea cakes and pastries, including a Jeju tangerine milk tea... So refreshing!"
21,5.0,"Samcheongdong is located on higher ground at the foothills of Seoul's Bukhansan (northern mountains). It used to be full of traditional Korean houses or hanoks but many of the owners have either sold or leased out their premises so the area has developed into a charming district of hanoks interspersed with contemporary low rise buildings with many cafés and restaurants, art galleries and private/mini museums and artisanal shops. The Korean Prime Minister's residence is located along Samcheongdong 7-gil (street). While Garosugil in Sinsadong, Gangnam is primarily a commercialized shopping street dotted with a handful of cafés, I prefer the laid back vibe of Samcheongdong with its electic mix of private hanok dwellings and small enterprise. There are more cafés than shops in Samcheongdong. One heads to Garosugil to shop but Samcheongdong is the place to go cafe-hopping. The nearest subway station is Anguk Station on the orange line."
22,5.0,My wife and I spent about two hours wandering the streets of this hip and charming neighborhood in Seoul.  We found our way in to some wonderful little shops and bought some wonderful local products.  A very cool area of the city that visitors of Seoul should definitely check out!
23,5.0,Loved wandering here ... Give yourself plenty of time and relax with the crowd's pace ... Cathartic if you can take it all in. Like visiting a Korean Museum of Art.
24,4.0,"There are more specialised shops which is very trendy and with their own character. Spend a relax afternoon there shopping and enjoy afternoon tea. I have tea in a cafe that serve traditional Korean snacks, very nice."
25,4.0,"Samcheongdong is an up and coming neighborhood located between Gyeongbokgung and Bukchon, and has become trendy of late. Designers, art galleries, fusion restaurants are to be found on each side of the neighborhood's main artery. It feels less commercial than Garosugil, and less over-the-top than Apgujeong, giving the place a very organic feel. It's also perfectly located, surrounded by Bukchon, Jongro, Gyeongbokgung and Bukhansan. It's way more relaxing than other trendy neighborhoods, and is a great place to chill out and shop or relax with your other half. That being said, there isn't anything specific to see per se. The neighborhood is nice to stroll around, but don't expect some must-see Landmark."
26,4.0,"Samcheongdong-gil road!! Amazing place! The street is lined with cafes, museums, antique shops and a number of famous art galleries."
27,5.0,"Let me just say that having lived in Seoul for two years, I developed a walking tour route for when people visited. This attraction is part of that tour that can be lengthened or shortened as needed. The general route was: Begin at City Hall, walk up through Gwanghwamun Square visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream and a possible visit to Hangul Museum under statue, continue to Gyeongbukgung Palace. Time permitting walk up through Samcheongdong into the Bukchon Hanok Village, continue down to where the tour ends in Insadong. This is enough for just about a full day of touring and requires A LOT of walking.Samcheongdong is a beautiful and quaint little neighborhood that is actually one of the oldest in Seoul.  It is actually a great place to eat/visit a cafe as part of a walking tour because although it is touristy, it is much better for food than the neighboring Insadong.  Eating here will be more expensive than many parts of Seoul, but again, I think the food is some of the best in the area, especially if you are just visiting Seoul and need something with a little more English (Menus etc.)This is also a very good place for a romantic dinner or date."
28,4.0,"It's a pleasant walk up to Samcheongdong from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Most of the little shops and boutiques only open from around noon, so I suppose the idea is to eat, shop, eat, shop, snack, and well, eat again. I say that because there's just so many cafes, restaurants and dessert spots here (do explore beyond the main street as well), that it's hard to make a choice for a single afternoon meal. But take your time and have your fill of Korean food, coffee, ice-cream and waffles. If you need that bit of a ""distraction"" in between food (and there isn't thaaat much shopping to do here), you could walk up to the Bukchon Hanok Village. There's isn't much to the village actually, but the multiple flights of stairs could help burn away some calories before you replace them with more food.There's a relatively strong police presence here, because I think this is in the vicinity of the Prime Minister's residence. Lucky him, he's got loads of sweet treats just nearby."
29,5.0,"It is very famous site in Korea. There are lots of restaurants, coffeshops, fancy shops.So, if you have a plan to visit Seoul, I'd liked to recommend this place.You will never forget!!"
