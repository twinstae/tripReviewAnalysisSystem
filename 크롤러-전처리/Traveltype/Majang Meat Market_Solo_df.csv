Try the different stages of bean pastes, from fresh to 3 years old.  This is a tourist paradise and eye-opener.  As is the surrounding neighbourhood for herbs and spices, ginseng shops.  Easy to find from the metro. A vibrant spot to visit."

Also, if you want tenderloin you need to let them know 1-2 days in advance. Any other cut you can find on demand.I read a review by a lady that said the store owner is very honest. That is hilarious. First, I'll assume she is a rich lady because she bought the 75000W (75$) Korean beef - which may have included 2 steaks. Second, this is a massive market and honesty isn't flying around like pretty purple butterflies. If they can cheat you, they will --- though a few of the elderly grandmas are honest. I've had guys try to rip me off so many times because I am a foreigner, but I speak enough Korean to argue about meat and prices. **Also, many sellers will tell you something is Korean beef ""Han-oo"" and charge you a ridiculous price, and then give you AU or USA beef. This happens often and unless you know the difference I'd just buy USA-meeguk-sal, or AU-hoju-sal.I'm not sure why people praise Korean beef. Koreans have a sentimental attachment to their domestic beef, called sonmat, a belief that home-grown food is always good for you. It is good, but it is not worth 75$ for two small, thin steaks. Although if you have the money and you're certain the seller is giving you Korean beef I would say try it because it is fresh meat. I would rather have a lot of decent meat than a small portion of expensive meat for the same price. But sometimes I do eat the glorified Han-ooDon't get me wrong, I love going here. twice a month, maybe more in the summer because I bbq often, but you can negotiate. Majang has other meat restaurants though with fresh beef. I'd only go here to buy meat to take elsewhere. Why? because it smells like a meat locker!"
