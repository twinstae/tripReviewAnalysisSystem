0,4.0,Been there on April 2019. There are lot of brands on each floor of the Mall. On 6th floor there is used and new mobile equipments... and i think it is the only place that “doesn’t fits” to style of this Mall. All other stores and food court as every standard big Malls

It was a bit overwhelming due to size and the stores were all together - you walk from one to another on the floor- nothing that separates them. You can find anything from clothing, cosmetics, housewares and toys. Great for the person who enjoys shopping!"

Maybe it is the huge IMAX with 4D that is a little spec on one side, or the water park that just shows up outside the window all of a sudden.  Perhaps it is food of all types and cultures scattered on every floor.  Beware any cake in Korea... so far.. ehhh.If you are used to the organized chaos of an American mall, you will find yourself lost.  You want a phone, here you go, all 50 little retailers are in the exact same spot.  (imagine an empty Sears with all of one type of thing but many different businesses in the same area)  Want a chair, go upstairs to see the 500 different types of chairs and 400 different vendors.  The place is awesome in size as well as content but definitely not the easiest to navigate.  Best advice... go... have fun, buy a cool desk or random thing you've never seen before, chances are they will deliver.  Don't eat at the first restaurant you run into, every floor is flooded with food and that could be a trip all by itself.  Good luck and have fun out there!"
