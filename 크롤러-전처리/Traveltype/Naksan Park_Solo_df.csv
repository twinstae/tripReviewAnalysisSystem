0,4.0,"From Hyehwa Station, I first visited the nearby Marronnier Park before arriving at Naksan park and then continue my way to Ihwa mural village. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill for about 450 meters. It was hot & sunny as I was there around noon. There were only a few locals using the park.The park features multiple facilities an exhibition hall, a pavilion, a center for seniors, basketball courts, badminton courts, and many squares that offer wonderful views of the area below. A portion of the old fortress wall runs through the park. From Naksan Park, visitors can walk along the Seoul City Wall to Dongdaemun."
1,4.0,It's a nice park with great views on the city. It's very steep. It's next to Ihwa Maeul so it is easy to combine the two.
2,4.0,"The Naksan park is a beautiful park and is definitely an underrated place. How to reach here: hyewha station, line no 4, exit 2/3.Walk for 450 m and the park is right there. Itâ€™s ok uphill so be ready to walk a lot. Not suitable for elderly. The place give a bird eye view of daehango and surrounding area. I recommend to start from the one end of park that is close to hyewha and then walk down to dongdaemun crossing the beautiful Iwha mural village on the way which has unique paintings on the wall of houses.Better to wear sport shoes and come. Nice view. Photogenic place. Can spend around 2-3 hours and reach dongdaemun via mural village. A must visit for someone who is spending adequate time in Seoul and can be skipped if spending only a limited days in Seoul."
3,5.0,Is a long walk with a great view of the city. Close to the Mural Village. Lots of restaurants/coffee shops around and some art galleries close as well
4,5.0,"Rather than a hiking feel, it has more of an incline long walk kinda feel. Weather was chilly when I had my walk from Dondaemun all the way up to Naksan Park. Beautiful scenery. One can slowly take their time to roam around the area and enjoy the landscape."
5,4.0,"The only direction I found to find this place was to get off at Hyehwa station and follow the signs. Walking along I found a sign towards the university to the left and followed Naksan road around until I found a set of steps which took me up a hill. Then from there I followed my instincts and walked straight up a steep road. All up it probably took half an hour's walk from the metro station, possibly less.The views are of the Seoul skyline, which is mainly just skyscrapers and residential tower blocks, but the highlight is the view of N Seoul tower on one side and the fortress wall on the other side. Grabbing a photo with the fortress wall and the satisfaction of reaching the top made the whole thing worth doing.Best of all, it's free entry, and it appeared to be open all hours, so it can be visited day or night. I was there at 3pm on a weekday and the place was empty."

7,4.0,"The Seoul city wall walk is highly recommended. If you can't do the whole walk, this makes a good section to choose. You can start at Dongdaemun and walk to Naksan Park and visit the mural village nearby. Naksan Park offers nice views of Seoul. Bring some snacks and get some exercise. This area is clean and safe and offers exercise machines as well."
8,4.0,"Nice walk with good views of Seoul, the wall and plenty of art shops where to stock on souvenirs and gifts. Quiet and less crowded than other places in the city."
9,5.0,a small lovely hiking place in seoul. the pathway follows up the various castle walls leading up to the seoul namsan tower towards the end. amazing little escape from the busy city life.
