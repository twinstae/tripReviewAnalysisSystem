There is a hugh promenade where you can sit and relax, walk, chat with friends. There are dedicated cycling tracks which go along this bridge. Looking forward for a visit back soon."
2,2.0,"I walked to the site from the Express Bus Terminal. I went there twice and was disappointed that they cancelled the show with an announcement the first time I went when it was supposedly scheduled due to wind direction change. I could understand that because the rainbow effect would have been distorted, unless they had different reasons for the cancellation. If you're the area by the scheduled time for the show, you may drop by here to chill, relax or exercise. The second time I went, I was again disappointed and this time there was no announcement. We just waited in the cold cold weather.  I hope they could make a timely advisory on any cancellation so people won't be expectantly waiting for a very beautiful fountain show as I have seen in some korean shows. In case of non-showing, I just shopped in the underground shopping of the Express Bus Terminal subway station."

There are a number of local takeaway drivers on scooters that drive right up to you and shove menus in your face- but there are plenty of places to pick something up on the way, or a 7-11 in the park; worth a visit if you are looking for something to do of an evening in Seoul!"
