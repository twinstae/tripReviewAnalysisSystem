There's a large range of food which can be searched and selected (in English) on a computer screen. Once you've chosen, it prints off a little ticket for you to take to the till, pay and then you're given a buzzer and directed to the correct counter so you can go and collect your food when it's done. Could not be easier and the staff were clearly used to dealing with nervous tourists and were very kind and patient."

Excellent shopping outlets for everything starting from 1st floor and up. Little costly but high quality products.At the floor below 1st floor, there is a good superstore and grocery. You can buy many house hold things at cheaper rate.I was staying in hotel named ""Ibis style ambassador gangnum"". This store is 10 minutes walking distance from this hotel."
