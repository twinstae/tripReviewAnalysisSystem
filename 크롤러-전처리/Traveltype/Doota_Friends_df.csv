0,5.0,We highly recommend this mall for those who are looking for late & night shopping. Many korea. Brands and cloths with a very reasonable prices and unique designs
1,5.0,It is very funny and excellent place to go around to shop. You can also go other stores for more options-convenient!
2,2.0,"Minimum half of the workers donâ€™t speak korean, especially the ones in Innisfree. I beg your pardon, but not knowing what Sale and Discount means? Why are you even working in a place with full of foreigners"
3,3.0,"Had some time to browse around in the mall. The mall was okay for us. They sell what most malls in the world sell. A lot of things mostly cosmetic and perfume, bags, clothes, etc. It operates from 10am ish until 5am. Unbelievable! There is a famous restaurant next to the mall, Shake Shack. We wanted to try it sooo bad, because we have heard about it for many many years but the one in Dongdaemun is not halal. Right across the mall is Dongdaemun History and culture park. The mall is easily accessible to subway stations."
4,4.0,"This mall have line friends store  at the ground floor , small boutiques inside , men level , women's level , children's level , food court level , cosmetics level on different floor , I like the no brand store inside . To my dismay I can't buy the cosmetics here inside the duty free because I'm flying to jeju the next day and not flying back home"
5,3.0,"This mall is super nice and has a huge selection especially woman's clothing. There's also a nice food court and coffee shops. My only gripe was that it looked like a higher end Namdaemun market where they hand pick stuff from there and put them on hangers in this mall. We saw clearly fake Chanel and Manolo Blahnik stuff so just beware. They also had a large Nike, Supreme, Yeezy section which looked too good to be true, maybe they were tier 1 fakes, but I didn't want to risk it. Overall a nice mall, but again just seemed like a repackaged indoor Namdaemun."
6,3.0,"Doota is a big mall where you can find many things there especially clothes. In the 6th floor (if I'm not wrong) there is gift shop ""Arirang"" that sells many kind of souvenir/gifts with cheap price. You can also find Duty Free shop."
7,5.0,"Doota duty-free shopping mall in Seoul where you can find all your shopping needs, especially fashion items."
8,4.0,"After DDP we went to Doota Mall, we just heard that there's Descendants of the Sun Special Exhibition there so we just went here for Song Joongki. Haha. Though we stroll around a little bit, Doota Mall is a variety of expensive clothes (for me) lol - There are lots of Branded Stores."
9,4.0,Located at dongdaemun. Big mall n many brand in there to shopping. Have tax refund counter inside the mall.
10,4.0,"This mall was a great respite after going through the monotony of the Dongdaemun shopping centre cookie cutter shops (although we did manage to pick up a couple of things there). It's an upmarket mall so definitely prices are steeper, but good hangout for window shopping and getting some eats in the basement foodcourt."
11,4.0,"if you are looking for a place to dine or sit down in dongdaemun, this is the place!it's at the basement floor, clean and great for dining.i like the seafood sundubu (hot and spicy stew with soybeans, egg and seafood- it's always my most favourite korean food) my friends had the kimchi stew and was better than the food court at coex underground mall.do remember to put the bowls and trays at the designated trolley after you finish your food."
12,5.0,"Doota Mall located near DDP (Dongdaemon Design Plaza) and easy accessible by metro or bus. You can find nice clothes with good quality here. Price for stuff here cheaper than in Loota fittin, which is located in the same area. All other malls around here have cheaper items with lower quality."
13,3.0,"The items sold here are very expensive.. Took a walk around in the mall but did not manage to buy anything. Unless you are into designers items and willing to spend that much amount of money, I think it is not really suitable for normal shopping with items of reasonable price."
14,5.0,"What a fun place to shop!  The experience alone was worth the visit. The shops stay open really late so if you need things to do after dinner and karaoke, go check it out.  The staff working at the mall were all very friendly."
