0,3.0,"It is a landmark in the Hapjeong area, newly built towering over most other buildings in the area. + New chic restaurants and shops (shoes, cosmetics, food candles and design, cinema).+ Great facilities !+ Right next to Hapjeong station!- Not so much to do only has about 3 floors and most of it is for food. If you are looking for genuine Korean food don't come here. - A bit expensive."
