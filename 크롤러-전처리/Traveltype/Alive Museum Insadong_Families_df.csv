It was actually located in the same basement as Dynamic Maze.There are a lot more interactive exhibits here than the typical trick art museum which sets it apart, with several mazes like the mirrors room (think Bruce Lee), dark room as examples.We also got lucky as this place is very near a highly rated insadong dumpling restaurant that I also reviewed."
1,4.0,We went to this place as part of the Discover Seoul Pass. Admission was free for the family. We thoroughly enjoyed taking pictures in all the sets especially the ones in the dark room.
2,5.0,"We went to Insadong several times, the second time I took my two teenage grandchildren to the museum while the others shopped. We got right in, no waiting. We only had 1 1/2 hours and wished we would have had a full two hours or more. We had a blast being silly and taking pictures. It was very clean, most of the pictures had instructions in English. But the ones that helped most had small pictures at the side that gave you an example of how picture should look. A couple of them were a little hard to figure out as you had to stand in exactly the right place and shoot into a mirror to get the picture correct. Loads of fun overall."
3,4.0,"My children loved this place.  The Alive Museum and Dynamic Maze.  We got there as soon as it opened so didn't have to contend with crowds.  I imagine my review may be different if we were there on a weekend or during a busy time.  You have to place all belongings in a locker to complete the maze, but, it was so much fun.  Brain teasers, crawling, climbing, memory games, dark tunnels...a lot of fun.  The 3D pictures turned out well, though I couldn't always figure out the angle.  Between the maze and the pictures, we spent about 1.5 hours here.  Afterwards, the street food vendors were setting up and we were able to shop in Insadong."
4,2.0,"The museum itself is interesting. Yet too packed. When taking photo for one, one will be blocking the photo of other so this overlapping lower the value and enjoyment at the attraction. Also, the queue for ticketing is long."
5,5.0,The best place to visit if the weather is bad. Allocate 2-3hours for this place. Go early to avoid crowds.
6,5.0,"We had fun taking pictures of ourselves in so many different scenes. This attraction is ideal for couples, families or small groups, so you can take pictures of each other.The instructions are also available in English and the staff knew enough English to answer all our questions. An added advantage is the other attractions available with the Dynamic Maze and Dark Room etc. It is also located in the Insa-dong area for plenty of food and other shopping activities."
7,3.0,Certainly not as good as the 2 mentioned above but it was still fun for our 5 year old. We also feel that some exhibits were rather tasteless and it can do better to go for originality and wit.  Tip: search online for foreigner discount coupons before your trip.  U may also got package prices eg pairing it w Nanta tickets to get more value for your dollar.
8,5.0,"We did the Trick Art Museum on Jeju Island, so we decided to do the Alive Museum while in Seoul. We did a combination ticket from Seoulpass.com for both the Alive Museum and the Dynamic Maze. The Alive museum is different than the Trick Art Museum in that you need to do a lot more work to get a picture (difficult poses), but our family had a great time doing the poses. Highly recommended."
9,2.0,I had a poor experience there where the Chinese speaking counter lady refused to acknowledge the discount voucher I had from the KTO. She said the discount was already given since I got the maze/museum package. But later I verified online that this is not the case.
10,4.0,"Did this on our last day in Seoul. The grandkids had a good time. Lots of photo ops. The maze was fun to do also. This is a good family experience. A little pricey at 18000 Won apiece, the kids cost the same as adults."
11,4.0,A bit of light fun. Came away with some great photos for the album.  Sometime things lost in translation. Some of the exhibits a bit dusty which affected the pictures. Worth popping in if you're in the area.
12,5.0,"It's a really funny place, you will enjoy it. I recommend visiting it after going to museums. This place will make laugh endlessly"
13,4.0,"My two daughters, aged 13 and 10, loved going round this museum taking some amazing photos, like of them brushing the Mona Lisa's hair, being in a photo in the President's office, being a baby in a pram, being attacked by a crocodile to name but a few!! A great family activity."
14,5.0,The place is full of spots for photo-taking with various 3D posture.  Entry fee is required. Be sure to charge up the battery to visit this place.
15,2.0,"Not much good, once a visit, but try dynamic maze, it was awesome and really worth. Something new i have tried."
16,5.0,"We made a stop to please our kids (7 and 9) after some visits to palace and old town. I thought it would be a quick stop and decided to wait outside for my husband and the kids. Tickets are not cheap with 25,000 won for adults.They spent more then one hour inside and had a lot of fun taking pictures. You can pretend being a king, climbing up houses, pulling a lion's tail and lots more. And the pictures look so real. Great optical illusions."
17,4.0,"Our 11 year old was keen to visit this place,  and after spending a few hours at Seoul's excellent war memorial museum, we thought we owed her a couple of hours of fun, and, we got it.  Huge number of optical illusion photograph opportunities in this museum. Lots of fun for everyone I think.  Seemed expensive compared to other museums in Seoul, but, in the end, I thought it was worth it."
18,5.0,"Bigger than the TrickEye Museum in Jeju and more interesting. They are 3D Arts, not just frames of paintings. Every Art has explanation and position spot for you to take photos."
19,3.0,"Read some of the reviews about it and got tickets thro a booking website.  Was a bit confusing collecting the tickets as there are 2 Alive Museums along the same street in Insadong, Seoul. The main branch  that we went to was at the south end of Insadong, while is other branch is in Samsegil further north on the same street.You will need your digital camera or phone camera, and also friends/family to take the pictures. Don't go alone !!!  Some of the effects are quite good and realistic, esp those with some depth perception. Our favourites were the large rolling boulder (like Indiana Jones) and crossing a wet street on a bridge.The ones that weren'r really a hit with us were those with gimmicky cartoon characters, the suggested poses weren't great and we didn't know these characters anyway (maybe a Korean would).Quite a fun time to spend out of the cold for a couple of hours, but unless they change and update, it won't warrant a repeat visit."
