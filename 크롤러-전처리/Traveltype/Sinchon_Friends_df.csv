Moreover, street performers and musicians come to Sinchon and they take the streets of Sinchon to give their audience a good spectacle. There really nice restaurants, coffee shops, ""norebangs"" Korean Karaoke and of course a shopping mall.Very close to Sinchon is one of the most famous Universities in South Korea. Yonsei University has its main campus across the street and you can go there and check the facilities without the need of a student card."
1,5.0,"Of those many campus business areas in Seoul, this is one of the best for University students, I think. It's not as touristic as Hongdae. But, also good to visit for tourists.- There are malls, shops, pubs, restaurants, noraebangs, houses for studio rooms, etc.- Prices are definitely cheaper than business areas for office workers like Gangnam.- The road to the main gate of Yonsei University from Sinchon Station is a great blvd. with cherry blossoms.- It's really crowded if there's any event like Yeongojeon(The sports week against Korea University).- The campus of Yonsei University is beautiful, too.- Sinchon is also close from Seogang University and Ihwa Women's Univerity. Hongdae is a bit away to walk."

5,4.0,"We booked an airbnb guesthouse si I stayed for 8 days. I haven't been to other parts of Seoul so I can't really compare. Sinchon is compact and an young person haven, a university town sort of. Young people walk here and there, cosmetics shops aplenty, (but then this is kr) and many cheap eateries abound. Hyundai shopping centre was fantastic, the food basement even better than takashimaya back home. There's a daiso so quite a lot of shopping options. It has a young person vibe I guess."

Set against the fall foliage, the University grounds were alit in orange, brown, red colours. The campus is large and has many buildings. If you are tired of shopping in Seoul, this is the perfect place to soak up some fresh air and clear your mind. It is just a 10-min walk from Sinchon subway station."

There are hundreads of drinking places, resturants, coffee shops, shopping and anything else an university student might like! Also they have a lot of street performances on the weekends. A must go if you are into that kind of thing."
14,4.0,"Sinchon is an area in Seoul that is the home to a number of colleges and universities, notably Ewha Woman's University and Yonsei University and a number of smaller ones.  The best area you might like to explore is a pedestrian street that is lined with shops, bars, restaurants and coffee shops and cafes.  You can visit here for a good walk, some shopping and a bite to eat.  Take the metro Green line 2 to the Sinchon station.  Take exit 3 and walk forward.  You will be amongst many young university students.  You will find many shops, many small places with some interesting items.  Also many restaurants, bars, coffee shops and every possible eating place you can imagine.  Walking forward the pedestrian walk turns right at the square that has a stage and sitting area.  Continue walking up one side and then you can walk back the opposite side.  There is a great Italian restaurant called Crevasse.  See my review for directions.  This is a fun few hours walking, eating and shopping.  The streets and sidewalks are bricked and comfortable to walk.  I visited during the day, but enjoyed it enough to visit again next time at night, which I am sure will be much more active."

There are food outlets and restaurants dotted everywhere in large streets and backstreets. There is entertainment all around the place such as bars, clubs, PC bars, table tennis hire, pool and billiards, coffee everywhere. Transportation is also very convenient with Sinchon subway and several buses on either side of the suburb/area/district."

This is the place for you, purchase few amounts of your won on the products, you'll get free samples, not only 5 but LOTS, even cosmetic pouch, merchandise of the endorsed kpop idol/celebrity, you won't be sorry."
