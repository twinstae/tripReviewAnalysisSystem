1,5.0,"When you think ""Love Museum"" you think Valentine's Day... This is NOT that!! LOL. If you're not easily offended by human sexuality and artwork, then please make this part of your trip!! It's so much fun!!"
2,5.0,Not very big but packed with tons of props for great pics. If you come to Seoul you have to put this on your to do list.
3,5.0,Funny for couples and friends. Nice place to spend 1 hour walking around and taking a lot of funny pictures.
4,4.0,My friend and I stopped by the Love Museum and thought it was hilarious. It‚Äôs kinda small but it‚Äôs packed full of erotic art from comic strips to ancient Korean erotica. The interactive sculptures and cutouts were hilarious but it‚Äôs best to go with a group or three or more so that you can utilise photo opportunities more. Exploring the museum doesn‚Äôt take longer that an hour but there is also a trick eye museum in the basement. The admission for this is separate.
5,5.0,Visited with friends over Chuseok and it was a really funny and interesting place to visit. Great to take pics and we even helped out an older Korean couple take some pictures. We agreed that it would have been an interesting place to go on a date so would highly recommend this place for someone looking for a unique date location.

11,5.0,It was everything and so much than I was expecting. Super racy but fun. Plus it makes for a great story.
12,5.0,"Visiting this exhibition was mostly hilarious because I went with a friend who got flustered ; we get why it's not allowed for minors. It was funny to be able to pose with some statues or to place our head to ""be"" the statue, but something interesting to me was the few ancient erotic paintings."
13,4.0,Ok so 8000 won isn‚Äôt so much but we were here for less than an hour and the big impressive museums are free! We still had a fun time! The pictures on the walls are very amusing. There are loads of photo opportunities! The models made us laugh. Would have loved a gift shop!!

15,5.0,"The museum offers excellent entertainment and picture opportunities. Even though I travelled solo, the other visitors were in very good moods so they took a lot of pictures of me when asked. Entry costs 8,000 won and it's definitely worth it. I would particularly recommend this place to people that won't make it to Jeju Loveland."
16,4.0,"Despite all the rave reviews and the pleasure that I gained out of visiting this place I still find the admissions a bit on the expensive side.  There is indeed a lot of creativity at this place and people, in particular couples, tend to have a nice time there."

It was kind of inspiring and sexual at the same time. Went there with some friends and we all really liked it. Its a nice place to take crazy pictures and worth going there"

At the end when you are about to finish they also have a TV screen where you can scan your face and appear on the TV and then you start with a towel dance lol. It is a must visit place for couples.
43,5.0,This was my very first experience to see such an adult with ‚Äúfulgar‚Äù concept. But you don‚Äôt need to worry because the drawings are made in a funny way. Don‚Äôt make ur live boring and challenge yourself to see this!
44,5.0,"Hahaha I have difficulties in forming the sentences since I feel this should be experienced by yourself, especially for those of you who are really in love with something funny, and extraordinary. A lot of ‚Äúshould be censored‚Äù stuff are here but they wrapped and arranged it to be fine for us to view as the visitor. And here are some of our photos while we‚Äôre here!"
45,5.0,"I visited the love museum with my friend and we had lots of fun ‚Äúappreciating‚Äù the displays. I think the displays about Korea in the ancient times were very interesting. Also, I feel a little shy but for the most part it was good fun!"
46,5.0,"After visiting the TrickEye museum and ice museum, was thinking should we enter the love museum as well and I believe we did a good choice lol.. it‚Äôs my first visit and had so much fun.. cool place!!"
47,5.0,"If you want to spend a really fun time with your partner this is the place to go.If seeing overdramatic pin ups, sexy cartoons and take overly funny pictures you should definitly go. This place is all about light hearted jokes about sexe and you can really have fun and laugh about this without feeling akward. Everybody is taking ridiculously funny pictures.Going with your partner will be even funnier."
48,5.0,Definetely place to visit with a partner. Is all about the sex but the funny and cluntchy way. People can take funny pics and having fun without feeling akward at all. Go for it!
49,5.0,"Reasonable price with reasonable facility. Definitely recommended. But if ur shy about sex, then don't waste ur money"
50,5.0,The museum is all about the sex but it is a funny sex. I laughed I lot and enjoyed with my friend.There are not many place which you can explore the sex with fun. It is worth to come.
51,5.0,The statue is sexy and with funny posture. I and my friends laugh a lots and take a lot of funny picture in love museum!
52,4.0,It is definitely my cup of tea. Having a cracking laugh. Dont take life too seriously while you are on holidays.
53,2.0,"Rather would call this a Sex Museum instead of Love museum. In the same building as the Trick Eye Museum, my friend and I decided to have a visit. Its quite explicit and I didn't feel the need to take any photos, however I'm sure many people can have some giggles."
54,5.0,We laugh a lot with my friend and take a lot of pictures there. It's the same building as  Trick Eye Museum and Ice Museum so no need to go outside. Great idea for rainy day indoors. Worth to check out!
55,5.0,That is actually right place for couple at the beginning of relationship:) provokes some nice topics to talk... Very erotic and I like it
56,3.0,"Husband and I decided on a whim to visit this place and had a few giggles. Best to take someone with you so you can take images if you wish. Its like trick eye museum but based around sex. Definitely not suitable for kids as people mentioned if thats not already obvious, you can see a pair of breasts from the stairs going up so shield your babies eyes! Lol. I was a bit disturbed about seeing children in the artwork  eg- a kid at the top of the stairs staring at a naked blonde woman, and other kids who are featured in some illusions. Overall, nice place to take your partner."
57,3.0,"The museum is in the same building as the Eye-Trick and Ice Museum. The pictures and statues are very amusing and make for great photos. You can finish the whole trip in about 30 minutes. A lot of great restaurants nearby.Cost for a single adult ticket is 8,000won. Not recommended for children."
58,4.0,"It's absolutely inappropriate for children or modest families, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. We went early on a weekday so there was almost no one there so we had the place to ourselves to take a bunch of hilarious pictures."
59,3.0,"I've been to the sex museum on Jeju and in Gyeongju. Wanted to take a friend who is leaving soon, it's more of a x-rated trick art museum. We still had a good time, but not quite the same."
60,2.0,It's not a museum.  It's a sex show place.  The photos were vulgar and only 2 to 3 rooms with some vulgar photos and statue.  A ripped off.  Don't bother
61,4.0,"Inside these 4 walls contain explicit sex scenes & figurines, some in 3D. Nothing to be shy about as we are all grown-ups if you are interested in visiting it. Here again with the nude figurines, it's left to your imagination on how to pose. I like the one with the Mother giving birth to her child. This can be more humorous if the photo is taken with the woman giving birth to an adult friend? Go imagine this and visit it with a creative and open mind; you will not regret it. Sometimes it's quite humorous as we see life in reality. For 8,000 Won or about SGD $10 you need about less than 1 hour to complete the exhibits. Thankfully, children are however not allowed entry."
62,2.0,Thought it might be an interesting place to visit.  Turns out it's full of giggling teenager to mid 20s and few old men!Cost is 8000won- not worth it!Better if you are there with 1-2 people so that you can pose and take photos. Some of it is a bit lewd but just fun and quirky pictures I am sure most young men wish were reality!
63,5.0,Compared to the alive museum and original trick eye museum we loved the realism that this museum affords over the others!....
64,3.0,"Well, nuf said. The inventor of this park knows the very core of human desire, SEX. Statues with explicit manouvres, men and women things. Not for kids please. We are Asians üòÜüòÜüòÜüëç"
