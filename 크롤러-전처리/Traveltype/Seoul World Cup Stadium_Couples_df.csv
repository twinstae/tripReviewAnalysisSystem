0,4.0,It's a nice stadium. With a massive super market underneath.  Really good food centre big cheap meals with a massive choice. Very slightly tricky to order. Best to look at pictures in menu/food catalogues.   choose pay at till. Get receipt wait for your number  on screen and go to numbered counter. You won't be disappointed with price and quality. After stadium we followed small river to main river and naval museum. Many riverside parks along the way. Then you can view the national assembly  on the other riverbank and head up to hapjeong station
1,5.0,"I like this place because its near our house and there are so many different things to do there. Food, shopping, movies, and soccer matches are all fun activities. Surely a must see when you are here"
2,4.0,"Easy to find - get off at World Cup Stadium stop and at the top of the escalator you will see the Stadium. We walked around and eventually found the entrance.   Unfortunately the museum was closed so we paid the cheap fee of 1,000Won to gain entry into the Stadium. We virtually had the Stadium to ourselves.  There was no guided tour and you are left to wander around yourself which was strange.  We found there was no real flow and we were unsure which areas we could go in and which were restricted.   We were also surprised at the lack of security and bag checking.  Unfortunately there were no matches for our time in Seoul as we would have liked to have experienced the atmosphere."
3,4.0,"This is much more than just a soccer stadium. It includes a large shopping mall, a dedicated train station (appropriately named “World Cup Stadium”) and a range of other health, food and entertainment facilities. It’s easy enough to get here on metro train line no 6. Just get off at World Cup Stadium station, a cavernous, modern and clean station with hardly any people. Once you exit it and get to the top of the long escalator, you will see the stadium looming large right in front of you. So far, so good, except that things got a bit tricky for us after that because there’s no signage to point you in the direction of where to buy tickets to enter the stadium.Eventually, we found ourselves wandering around the shopping mall, where we latched onto a helpful gent who spoke a few words of English: I assume that he worked at the mall in some official capacity but not even he knew exactly where the tickets could be bought. After he had consulted with some other official looking people, we were directed to an empty and rather forlorn looking office manned by a solitary sweet Korean lady who seemed delighted to be able to sell us two tickets for the princely sum of 1,000 won each (that’s less than $US1 and about $A1.20). I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the only sale she made all day. There are no tours. With your entry ticket, you just get a short, little brochure telling you about the stadium and you’re pretty much free to wander around at your leisure with no restrictions, for as long as you like. Nothing is out of bounds. Having visited major stadiums in the U.K., where security is tight, this surprised me. At Wembley in London for example and other large stadiums such as Anfield in Liverpool and St James Park in Newcastle, access is strictly controlled and no way would one be allowed to simply wander around on one’s own. The only way you get to see these places is with an organised tour. But I guess this rather casual attitude to security worked to our advantage as it was pretty cool to be able to spend as much time there as we wanted and to mosey around unhindered to see whatever we wanted to. We didn’t encounter a single other visitor for the hour and a half that we were there. The only other people we saw were a group of kindergarten kids kicking a ball around with their teacher. What we couldn’t see, and what we had hoped would be the highlight of the tour, the Museum, was closed for renovations. Or at least that’s what they told us, but with so few visitors, I wonder if it will ever re-open!Despite that disappointment, we enjoyed our trip to Seoul’s World Cup Stadium on a warm sunny day in summer. We walked around on the pitch and the stands took lots of pics, and went into the press room, changing rooms and something that looked like a practice strategy room complete with faux green grass. Everything is well maintained and spotlessly clean.After doing our tour of the stadium, we decamped to the shopping mall, which is right beside it in the same complex. I’m speculating that it may have been built to take advantage of the passing trade during the 2002 World Cup games, but it now seems like a bit of a white elephant. There are rows and rows of shops or little stalls selling overpriced clothing, jewellery, cosmetics etc., although I didn’t hear the sound of too many cash registers jingling. Most shop attendants were standing stiffly to attention at their posts, but looking rather bored. There just weren’t many people there, and even fewer actually buying anything. The impressive food court, though, seemed well patronised by locals, as did the supermarket in the same complex. When it came time for lunch, we struggled to find a place with an English menu or anyone who could even vaguely speak English to explain the offerings to us, so we settled for a little Italian restaurant just outside the food court, which turned out to be pretty disappointing. For the equiv of $A15, all we got was a tiny mushroom salad, two slithers of garlic bread and a cup of hot, black liquid which apparently was supposed to be coffee.In summary, unless you’re a soccer fan, or you have oodles of time to spare, I wouldn’t waste my time coming here. There are more interesting things to do in Seoul. But I had always wanted to see this famous stadium, so for us – me the soccer fan, wife the shopping fan - it was a pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable outing which didn’t take us long to get to, starting from Myeong-dong station on line 4, with a quick changeover at Samgakji to line 6, from where it about nine stops to W.C.S."
4,5.0,"Another great place that is excited to discover. They have great parks and the close by sky park and han river is near as well. The homeplus has lots of fun things to buy, and souvenirs as well.  The 2001 world cup soccer museum is open as well. Also try to go and see Seoul FC play a match"
