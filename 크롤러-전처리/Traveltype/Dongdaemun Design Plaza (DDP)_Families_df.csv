0,4.0,They have Dongdaemun show every night during the winter break.To have artistic show projected on the enormous surface of the Iraqi American designed structure was a sight to behold!
1,3.0,"The building design itself is interesting. Sloping corridor to get to the various levels that locate the museum.From the outside, it looks like a gigantic docked spaceship. It has two sections, the design plaza on one side and a museum on the other. When you are done, the shopping is simply overwhelming. This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market. This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly. It has even has two underground shopping malls. One at the main street and the other is adjoining the Metro station. Good for photo opp and place to shop"
2,4.0,The architectural facade of DDP is very unique. Outside the building is a good place for watching people and drinking coffee.
3,5.0,"Beautiful, artistic architecture that houses a museum, a kids playground, a gift shop and underground shopping mall. Take the lift up to the roof top and strolled down the ramp while admiring the wonderful view!"
4,5.0,It’s too cold to truly enjoy the outside of the structure .  Great to see the place. Luckily there are indoor place to eat and some small shop/store - I didn’t buy anything there. Also good to sit around have some snacks
5,5.0,"Visit exhibitions , souvenir shops , enjoy a cup of coffee or a meal in this mega structure.DDP is an architectural beauty that was design by the queen of the crazy structures the late (Zaha Hadid). It’s not your typical exhibition center it’s a place that you can do multiple activities in while enjoying this crazy structural beauty in a district that never sleeps"
6,4.0,What an amazing building!! The little shops in DDP were really interesting and worth exploring. Spend a lot of time in there. Glad that interior is not overly clutter but kept clean and minimalistic. The outside was full of activities so it was worth a trip both inside and out.
7,5.0,"This building is truly spectacular, and definitely worth a visit. There is a design museum and design exhibits to see. There is also plenty of shopping and dining opportunities around the plaza."
8,5.0,The plaza architect is stunning and exotic. It's really cool experience to walk through the buildings. There are some cherry blossom at the back of the plaza. (early April)
9,5.0,I really like it here. They had some pianos laying around so I got to play them. I like the idea of entertaining fellow visitors :)This doesn't have the LED rose since it's an exhibition that ended a long time ago (sad). But we got to walk around and appreciate the buildings in the night.I know that they over some exhibition at the halls but for God's sake this place is huge. We just had like 30 minutes to go around the area so I really want to go back and visit this place again!
10,4.0,"Cool building outside and in, located in the centre of Dongdaemun with the large shopping plazas, can come in to have a look around."
11,5.0,A very stunning building. Every corner of this building is a very good photo spot. Also don't forget to take photos at 'I Seoul U' sign while you are here.
12,4.0,"If you are a designer or has likes to see various creative work then this is an area you should visit while in Seoul. There are a lot of shops, exhibits, activities that you can visit and experience. Coffee shops, food shops, etc..are available as this is locatedon top of a subway train station (Dongdaemum History & Culture Park)"
13,4.0,"If you happen to pass by this attraction, go ahead and give it a visit. You will be marvelled by the design/structure of this building. It seems to be a convention area for special events. The time we went there were several food and retail carts along the garden area. The adjoining underpass had shops to check out. Overall a good place to hang out and chill after a long day."
14,4.0,"This building was full of curves and flowing lines that made it one of the coolest buildings we visited.  Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP.  A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down.The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day.   I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee (roughly W16000 for adults).  On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular.  There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana.  On the second floor was an art museum.  On the third floor was a children’s play area, some collaboration space and on the roof, a viewing area and a cafe.  In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating, a piano and various art pieces.  In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated.My daughter previously visited during the nighttime and enjoyed seeing the building lit up.  We will have to visit again."
15,4.0,"Glad that we saw this on-going Disney exhibition from 2019.4.19 to 2019.8.18. Really nice to relive the childhood memories and learnt more about how Disney actually evolves through the years. :-)Tickets are @ 15,000 KRW for an adult.There's another area with cafes and shops. Else just take a seat outdoor and enjoy the breeze.We saw the LED rose at night too!"
16,4.0,Nice place for photo shoot. There are a lot of points for photo. Sometime has show or exhibition there.
17,4.0,"First time to visit DDP and was impressed with its design. It’s like an infinity elongated curve from start to end. It would be nice if you could see the plaza in its total structure as it is quite unique and futuristic. We were there late afternoon and when it got dark, the lights gave the plaza an awsome ambience. They have this attraction which we visited and waited for hours the so-called led rose garden where hundreds or thousands of roses automatically light up as the sun sets. It was a nice view as the night went deeper. There are also have art hall, museum, design lab, design market, culture and history park but most of them were closed when we were there. It’s quite tiring if you tour around the big plaza but there are coffee shops and restaurants where you can eat and rest. It’s good to visit this place."
18,3.0,"I do love design so, I was really looking forward to my visit to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). Having dragged my family to it, I must say, I was --- disappointed.Yes, amidst Seoul’s skyline, the DDP’s facade is aesthetically unique for it’s fluid lines and steel curvatures. There is no doubt, its sheer outline exudes design.But once, we appreciated the swooping façade and geometries, there is just emptiness inside the building: empty rooms, empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces. For a designer, space is a design element but when we went (around 4 pm on April 17) there were no exhibits, no permanent showcase not even, food trucks. Just one big EMPTY building.OK, if you are a modern architecture design nut (and enjoy photographing shapes) but, you might want to skip this if you have mixed group. For a showcase design plaza, they really could have done more with it."
19,4.0,Ideally for teenagers that love shopping as some of the shops operate till 3am late night and lots branded is on sales ;)
20,4.0,"Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, DDP is the world’s largest atypical architecture. The DDP is comprised of five halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Lab, Design Market, and Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. The Art Hall is the primary launch pad for the Korean creative industry."
21,2.0,We went DDP for photostop only. I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place. There are some foodtrucks in December 2018.
22,5.0,"Located in Dondaemun, and very close to our hotel, this was a really interesting place to visit for all the family. The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extra-terrestrial space ship. You can wander around the outside, underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise.Inside there were many things happening. There is a huge and fantastic play area for children, an exhibition of Wallace & Grommit, many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays. Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed.Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship.During our visit in the evening time, there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery, singers and musicians performing, and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food."
23,5.0,Nice lighting around the area. The week that we went there they are having the mama awards but unfortunately we did not see any celebrity. Overall the building is nice.
24,4.0,"Unusual and unique gifts all under one roof! We bought baby socks, a big hexagonal dish, a foldable backpack, a watch and K-pop paraphernalia. We had fun checking out the wares that were on display.Tired and hungry? Perk-me-up treats are available at the AID cafe. Scones, sandwiches cake and coffees and teas. They were excellent."
25,5.0,"What are pleasant surprise, so many lights were light up and the view is nice. This building with super modern look!"
26,4.0,Beautiful building.  Attached with the subway that link to main station.  Nearby shopping area and restaurants.  Didnt get ti catch a show there because we didi not plan to.   But indeed it is a beautiful building to admire.
27,5.0,"Went there with the intent to explore any design exhibitions.  In the end, plans were mired by the architecture and Kakao store.  The architecture was fascinating enough to capture even a layman's eyes.  At ever angle near the building, it was stunning to see it especially closer to sunset.  Spent some time taking photos of the building.  Even more fascinating was how the building was not so obtrusive that it was rude to the environment.  It remained modestly unobtrusive, retaining the harmony and yet feature it's avant-garde intent.For families, they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there.  Shopping is welcomed there too.The basement has F&B outlets and shops.  The building is conveniently connected to the Dongdaemun History & Culture Park."
28,4.0,"We were not aware if there was any exhibit going on the time. We came at night and did not explore much, but it was already awesome."
29,5.0,DDP is a landmark that can’t be missed in Dongdaemun. Check the design shops and museum in the building for interesting design items. There was a street play by a young group about plastic pollution and a  Halloween-themed food truck lane. DDP is more beautiful at night.
30,5.0,"We purposely went there to see the landscape and the building, modern and we were like walking under a space ship hoping to meet some aliens there. Don't miss the LED Rose garden. Did not went for shopping there."
31,5.0,"This beautiful curvilinear building and artwork is an oxymoron to historical and cultural park. We only had time to walk the west side of the building and browse the arty design themed shops in the south part of the building. There are interesting pieces to buy in these shops. It’s a worthwhile visit on its own, or if some of your party prefers shopping for clothes at the malls across the street and you don’t."
32,4.0,"After seeing Korea's traditional houses, Dondaemun's design plaza shows the other side of Korea. The place is best viewed at night to see how the lights on the building facade highlights its modern design/architecture."
33,5.0,"Try visiting when they hold the evening markets. The whole place is amazingly designed (hence the name) and some of the galleries and exhibits are definitely good.Even the stairways are nicely designed, not forgetting the lightings.a good 1hr walk, even when your aim was to shop at DDM"
34,5.0,The building is beautiful and an amazing work of art. The walkways and overhanging beams make for great photos. There's many small boutiques inside that sell some of the most unique gifts and home decor I've ever seen! The top floor has a green-space and restaurant. Great area for just walking around.
35,5.0,"Come over to experience one of the last great architectural masterpieces by Zaha Hadid.  It will not disappoint.  She quickly understood that Seoul is defined by its seven rings of mountains.  Resembling a blobby mountainscape, you can walk on top of the complex and see the mountains yourself.  Come at about dusk.  The night illumination of this building is stunning.   Inside, one of the ""wings"" has a great collection of design stores that is easy to walk through and enjoyable to browse.  The other ""wings"" have changing exhibitions and shows.  Incredibly easy to get to as it is connected to the subway.  Don't forget the world famous GwangJang Open Market featured on travel shows worldwide for the cheapest and best eats.  Take a stroll along the Cheonggye Cheon Canal to get away from the city."
36,5.0,We arrived just before sunset & had the chance to see the transformation of this piece of art with the day & night time. An absolute gem in the Centre of Seoul. Worth going to appreciate the beauty created by an amazing artist.
37,3.0,"It is better to view this from a distance so you can appreciate the whole architecture. But once inside, there is not much to do."
38,5.0,"While staying in Dongdaedum, visited DDP many times. Loved the Farmer's Market, the LED flowers at night,and the design shops full of interesting and innovative products. Such an interesting building and the space around it."
39,5.0,"If you are walking around the Dongdaemun area in Seoul City and all of a sudden you notice a piece of architecture that looks like a spaceship. Don't worry  Seoul City is not about to suffer an alien invasion, don't you dare to run, what you actually have to do is to go inside that magnificent piece of architecture and let the fantastic futuristic concept and vision of the famous Iraqui-British architect Zaha Hadid to gravitate towards you, so you can experience a different state of mind while been there.I've been in Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) several times and every time I go there is always a new experience, I never get bored of that place. There are so many things you can do there, take a look at the art and design galleries, there are also food festivals at night so you can try Korean and western food as well. Inside the building, you will see galleries, souvenirs shops, coffee shops and more.If you have an Instagram profile then you can check the Instagram profile of Dongdaemun Design Plaza and you can see what they have to offer because they upload a schedule of their monthly activities there. I will highly recommend you to go there day and night time as well, so you can appreciate how different the style and feeling of the architecture can be."
40,4.0,"Omg, this place you can shop and shop till you drop.... many many kinds of fashion outlets and all the newest fashion are found here..."
41,5.0,"We visited the Dongdaemun Design Plaza late in the afternoon after a day of sightseeing as I was interested in seeing the Zaha-Hadid designed building in real life. The building itself is breathtakingly beautiful and equally impressive in my opinion and worth the trip alone. What makes it even better is that there is a very large kids play area on the top floor that provided hours of (air-conditioned) fun for our kids on a very hot day. In a busy city like Seoul that does not have a tremendous amount of activities for kids (note we live in Sydney, Australia so we're very spoilt for choice) this can be an absolute life saver and I don't understand why the play area is not advertised more.If I were to make a top 3 of things to visit in Seoul, the DDP would definitely be in it."
42,5.0,"enjoyed the design and if you go in the evening it is decorated with colorful light, found not much to do."
43,4.0,"This is a huge place full of interesting architectural designs. There are some shops indoors; another museum, cool eating/cafe area inside. Lots of great spots for pics. My daughter was there a couple of months ago during Fashion week & said you could see all kinds of ordinary people dressed wild, over the top, & cool during that time around there.- Our favorite part was relaxing outdoors on the big blue lounge beds. You must take your shoes off & then just lay down relax & enjoy the shaded breeze."
44,4.0,"As many are aware of, the design is the work of the famous Zaha Hadid.Looking very cool with futuristic curvy edges.But, the inside is not impressive. There were just a few events and shops. It felt like a newly built office building.There are some things to have fun, though. I found a free piano to play near the entrance in the middle."
45,4.0,This is the place where Seoul Fashion Week is conducted and it sits near the famous Dongdaemun Shopping Area. The building is contemporarily artsy and most people come here to take pictures on the photogenic spots.
46,3.0,"The only cool thing about this place is the design of the plaza and the rose led garden so go at night to see it lit up. Shopping is the same as everywhere else. I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market, they're pretty much the same except for the food variety. If you're tight on time, you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun.  They're pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern. If street food is more important to you and you're shopping for eyeglasses, Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections."
47,3.0,went to dongdaemun and pass by the DDP for a look around wonderful architecture but thats just it.. nothing special inside..
48,4.0,"The name of the place speak for it. It's a very decent plaza to hangout for awhile, all specially created gifts, toys, travel item etc. One of the booth attract me it's the 3D printing, you take pictures surrounded by lotsa camera from 4 direction and the owner can print your photo into 3D form. But a little costly for me. 25CM size cost you 550,000 won."
49,5.0,Nice building and design. Walking distance to dongdaemun shopping district. There is a museum too. Visit if you enjoy design and arts.
50,5.0,This is my first encounter with zaha hadid’s architecture and can finally understand her talents. Every architect who is aspiring to be great should come here to study her work. Architectural documentation does no credit to her.
51,5.0,"The design plaza is interesting to visit, with many modern sculptures and exhibits. I went to the Aardman exhibit, displaying many canimated creations such as Shawn the Sheep and Walace and Gromit. They explain the many different aspects that make clay figures into a movie, the final product. The exhibit provides you with original set pieces, drawings, and characters previously used. After you finish at the exhibit, there is a  picture taking area where you can pose with you favorite characters of the Aardman studios. The building is interesting, modern, and unique. Would definitely recommend."
52,5.0,"I only spent a while here because of time restriction, but if you wait until evening, the food truck will be open for business, and the surrounding will be lit. Inside, there are lots of exhibits and art market. On the top floor, they have a beautiful roof top garden and some restaurants. Definitely an artsy place I would recommend if you love art and design!"
53,5.0,It is amazing area for shopping especially at night there is beautiful designs of clothes with good prices
54,5.0,Chanced upon this place while visiting a local market. Very impressive structure that is worth a visit in its own right
55,4.0,"We went here on Sunday night to enjoy LED Rose Garden. We came from exit 1 of Dongdaemun History and Culture Park station. The building was so awesome. There was a skating rink there. Besides of rose garden, there was some exhibitions inside the building. Some of the exhibitions were free."
56,4.0,"The place looks surreal but I enjoyed visiting it especially since we went there at night. The building is a sight to see definitely but nothing much to do there. There is some shopping inside but the malls across the street from the DDP are more interesting. We looked for the touted thousand lighted roses but they were a dud. They looked like their lights were on their last blink, and they were not worth braving the very cold temp for. One visit is enough for me."
57,2.0,"Soooooo boring. Don't know. Some people like the building but inside nothing interesting. Only few expencive shops. Was glad to see a good shopping center nearby, so it made the way there not so useless :)"
58,5.0,A great place to see modern buildings with unique designs. There are shopping malls & art museums to visit. Very nice view and a picture perfect place if you are in Seoul. Not to miss this place! You can also catch the Seoul Bus Tour here.
59,5.0,"Incredible this construction! The Building is amazing and the gardens are very well organize. Dongdaemun has lots of things to do, museum, temporary expositions and shows."
60,4.0,"This place should be best to visit at night when the lights come on.  An impressive building by day, the structure and its surrounds really comes alive when the sun sets, and the various angles get enhanced by the external lights."
61,4.0,Nice place to visit. The architecture of the building is unique and interesting. Also a lot of stalls selling artsy and unique things from bags to cellphone accessories. Lots of places to seat outside as well.
62,4.0,"It is a very popular place, but it is more saying that it rally is. Has some cool places but not enough for a big place. I’ll doble think if I go there again."
63,2.0,"Other than the brilliant architectural design of the premises, there is nothing inside. No exhibition and just some stores only."
64,5.0,"Even if you aren't interested in the exhibition inside, visit at night and walk around the complex. The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is. It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments.When you visit inside during the daytime, you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is. You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms. Without knowing, you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor. There are lifts inside but if your physique allows, try walking."
65,4.0,The plaza is big and the design is unique. It has shops and eateries and a nice place to hang around. It is also near to the night market. A very lively place indeed.
66,4.0,"If you do not know where to spend your night in Seoul, this place is not bad. It is windy at night. There was a public piano put at the street, anyone can play. My girl who likes to show off enjoyed it so much ^_^"
67,5.0,We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful. There were  loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food. The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful. Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night.
68,4.0,You don't see this type of building in your day to day life. A moden marvel of architecture. A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy. (my kids were not interested though)
69,4.0,"We went there for the night market.We were attracted by the Kakao Friends shop, and spent some time there taking photo.The Night market opened at 6.30pm and it is outdoor. The tables are limited, but there are plenty of bench we can sit. There were music performers who showcase their talents. The food stalls were plenty. Some are so popular the queue can take a while. It's recommended for night out with family."
70,5.0,I love DDP.  There's always something new and fresh to explore.  I feel creativity coming from every angle and love wandering around looking at the buildings and sculptures.  I love that there's a continuous change of exhibits and love the vibe of the whole area.
71,3.0,"Yea, if you're into architectures, yea this is a must go place for you. But if you're not into it, DDP might only be a strolling place for y'all. BUT, there's this LED flowers now, and it looked really nice! Of course, it's in Dongdaemun district so you can come here for a good stroll at night after you finish your day shopping! Cause there's duty free shops and blah blah blah!"
72,4.0,"The structure of DDP is worth the visit.  There isn't much going on during the day but evenings are filled with street vendors that selling food, souvenirs, clothes, etc. The outside structure is very interesting with great architectural lines."
73,5.0,"The architecture of this place was amazing!  It was beautiful inside and out.  We went in the afternoon and missed the lighting of the LED roses at night, but even in the daytime, those flowers were impressive, especially the history behind them.  There were nice shops inside the actual building, and even the kids enjoyed the place.  The surrounding area is a shopper's paradise although we didn't get to actually go inside those stores.  I would definitely explore this area more if I had more time."
74,3.0,"We went here with friends one night for a look see. The buildings themselves are really cool architecture and the rose light garden is great to see, but apart from that much of the buildings are still empty and the design part is not so obvious.  There is a good atmosphere in the precinct and opportunity for good food."
75,5.0,I was surprised to see this beautiful building..  And then I discovered that it was designed by Zaha Hadad the great engineer..  You can go around the build but I don't think there are much to see and to do inside
76,5.0,The architecture was very impressive! It's really an icon for art. They held art exhibition regularly too.
77,3.0,"Lots and lots and lots of shops!!! Can be quite pricy for the local designers apparels, pay for their quality."
78,5.0,"The DDP (Dream Design Play/Dongdaemun Design Plaza) is humongous in its entirety. It's also a great place for people who appreciate modern art and architecture, as the DDP holds about 4 floors worth of exhibition space for lectures, talks, and other brand launches (When we visited last week, they were even hosting a launch for Louis Vuitton and Pixar Animation). Even if you have nothing to do here, the area itself is like a playground for the senses. Everything was built to tower over you, and it encloses you in this serene space away from the bustling city just a jump outside of its entrance. There are places to sit, floors to ascend, and it's connected to the subway proper so you'll never get lost. A lot of retail stores and restos beneath it were closed when we were there as a family, but the ones that are open look cozy and modern without being too pretentious. Plus, this is a great place to linger because DDP is literally next to the busy Dongdaemun City center and crossing. You can access Doota Mall or Migliore from here (Doota is more expensive, Migliore is cheaper for clothes and other goods) Great place to get lost in! Would come again :)"
79,5.0,We didn't plan well so ended up reaching here quite late and by that time we were tired as well. It's a nice place with lots of activities for kids . So if you want to spend sometime with kidd doing done design workshops this is the place to go.
80,5.0,As dongdaemun is famous for its shopping area. this plaza adds beauty to this place. this plaza is also a fashion hub there fashion shows are held regularly.
81,3.0,Actual place is another 1km away. We ended up taking another taxi ride to the actual place. Google map would be a more actual representation.
82,5.0,"Not being a fan of Museums, well I thought this was one of them, it surprised me, it had shops restaurants and everything in between. It even hosted food trucks! Amazing! Well worth the visit!"
83,4.0,"If you're already at the area and have a few minutes to spare, then it won't hurt to go here. There are a lot of magnificent art and building designs to see which is great for picture taking. Aside from that, there are also various food carts which features authentic Korean street food that will keep your tummy full while exploring."
84,5.0,"DDP is close by to Dongdaemun market, didn't think we will spend much time here but once we were here it was really quite something. The Design Lab had many different stalls selling different artists unique crafts and gadgets. We easily spent over an hour in there. Worth visiting for all tourists."
85,5.0,"First i saw this buliding, so exited. Its so unique like ufo building ^^I recommend you to go here at night because its more beautiful with led rose garden. Light floor like tetris just wow to me can go here. Its really modern Building Near with doota and other fashion marketI just regret didn't get into this buildingNext trip i will explore all ^^Dont forget to come here when youre on dongdaemun area ~"
86,4.0,It is not really a good place to shop...but a best place to see latest fashion if you love K-Pop. It is quite expensive ...but a good place to stroll around
87,5.0,1) Main thing about this place is its cosmic architecture. Spend some time and try to rich all points and layers of this gorgeous building.2) Two small museums and exhibition spaces. Museums have free admission. Admission for exibitions varies.3) Lot of small shops in Design Labs and Design Market. Good place for gifts hunting. Price range — mid and up.4) Very nice nursery room. Beautiful garden on the roof.
88,5.0,"an awesome work from the late Zaha Hadid! It's timeless. aside from the awesome shape, check out how sunlight bounces off the building."
89,5.0,a super cool architectural building in dongdaemun.... the great spot for those who likes to take a picture.. cause in this shape are unique.... recomended for tourist and local people... my advice go to this place at night cause the light are gorgeos :D
90,4.0,This is a huge building with modern design. Worth the visit just to see the shape of the building. There are shops on the ground floor.
91,4.0,It's pretty modern and cool place to spend an afternoon... plenty of shopping to be done nearby and it's right off the subway station.
92,4.0,"The 2nd time to me to go to DDP, but for my big family is their first time, they very exiting to see the beautiful and unique design of the building, inside area beside museum, there a lot of resto area...."
93,4.0,"I visited here with my family of four including two young children.  The building has a unique architectural history and design for those who are interested.  Also, there are several stores and direct access to the metro.  I wouldn't stop just to see this, but one can visit in quickly in passing. Enjoy!"
94,5.0,"In this spaceship like building, my kids got to ride the virtual roller coaster, fee was very reasonable.There's also this one area that has 260+ cameras that took a 360 degree picture of my daughter and my son. From those pictures, it created a 8"" tall (you select the size) figurine(action figure) and 2 weeks later, it came in the mail to my home. It's not perfect like a photo, but it sure is really close! My kids were hesitant to try, but I told them that one day when they become my age, it'll be fun to show their kids what they looked like at age 15 & 17. I love it!!!! It's such a wonderful keepsake for me, and one that my kids can treasure and admire in their latter years. My kids were surprised at how much it really looked like them.Across the street, there is a multilevel (maybe 8 stories) shopping center, that from the outside it looks like a department store, but in the inside, it's actually an indoor market where each stall is independently owned, and you can bargain with the price. They also sell some knock off wallets and purses too."
95,5.0,Unique architecture. A place to walk around. Many good LED deco in the plaza. LED rose garden is very nice too. Worth a visit!
96,3.0,Magnificent building and worthwhile to visit.  However there is not enough signage for visitors to navigate around.  The led lighted flowers are beautiful to behold.  It was definitely a beautiful and challenging walk during the winter night.

98,5.0,"This design plaza is designed by an Iranian Architect. Located right on top of the subway line (DDP station), its such an amazing building. The plaza itself is nothing to shout about, with some restaurants and shops, but the building futuristic design is the attraction. Do visit the LED lights Flower garden besides the building. Take some nice photos there. You may adjourned to the surrounding malls for your retail therapy.  Dongdaemun area is fantastic for food and entertainment."
99,4.0,"Another landmark one must go to.  It is not so impressive from afar but once you go to the plaza itself, it is really impressive.  Of course having the shopping around the area adds to its attractiveness."
100,4.0,"Designed by Zaha Halem. Great for photo taking. The state of the art and futuristic building. Love the rose garden. Went there in the night, the led roses are all lighted up.

102,4.0,Went here around sunset time. Loved how the sunset was beaming against DDP's walls. Can be a bit tiring on the way up if you're not into walking up a slope :P Very accessible via Dongdaemun History & Culture Park subway station.
103,4.0,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is around Dongdaemun area and it is accessible if you are heading to Doota Mall from the Dongdaemun Subway station. Just a stop to capture some nice photos but encourage to go Dongdaemun Design Plaza in the morning to see the whole building.
104,4.0,"Nice place for photo shoot and enjoyable exhibitions from time to time! I've been there twice, still feels like going there again!!! The building is beautiful both day and night!!! Such a relaxing place !!!"
105,4.0,"The building's architecture is very unique and modern.There are exhibitions inside but you have to pay a certain price to see them.Admission fee depends on the current exhibition,but you can still check the inside of the museum for free.The whole thing looks like a spaceship.2 hours should be enough to check the whole place and take photos."
106,4.0,This is one of eye catching building in Seoul. Located on top of subway station (Dongdaemun station). Surrounding area is lively during day & night. A lot of duty-free complex.
107,4.0,"A very modern, artistic and cyber looking building. Classical landmark icon to be. Visiting in day and night provided different atmosphere and impression. A definite place to visit for photographers and architects. Easily accessible by Metro."
108,4.0,"Interesting exhibitions on different floors, we started from the street level up. There's a mix of fun and serious displays which made our trip ""light"" and enjoyable."
109,4.0,Came by during the day and saw how modern the building was but mainly wanted to see the roses at night. Walked briefly around the building and saw there were exhibits and possibly a fashion/model event inside. Spent time shopping in all the plazas and went to find the roses around 10pm. Glad to see how helpful patrol staff are to point as to where the LED roses were. It was pretty although a little hard to capture in photos but the view was lovely.
110,5.0,"Looks like giant spaceship, world's largest tri dimensional structure, open 24 hours a day, with many surprises inside....especialy latest design trends."
111,4.0,"Visited at night time to check out the LED flowers. It's good that it's only 2 stops from the Myeongdong subway station. It's just right outside upon exiting the station. The LED white roses are located at the 'Grass Hill'. I wasn't as bright as it seemed in the pictures I saw. Maybe 10-20 minutes tops to look around and take pictures, but that's about it. I peeked inside the building and saw there were museums and small kiosks, but most of them were closed by the time we got there. It's good to see if you have time."
112,3.0,"This is a very impressive building but that's about it. Inside it is rather dull, not many things to do. However, one can take awesome photos around the building. I would recommend to visit this area only if you intend to do a lot of shopping in any of the many clothing malls around the Design Plaza."
113,5.0,"Designed by Zaha Hadid, the whole area is hip and modern. Very accessible as it is only above the metro station. We went there in a sunny Saturday afternoon , there was lots of street arts & activities at the plaza. The book store & design shop are also not to be missed if one is opt for shopping !"
114,3.0,"If you like architecture, you will be fascinated to see this dome. Located in Dongdaemun (shopping area), you will get to see this surely. But nothing to do here, hehe."
115,5.0,"Modern design of building, lots of innovative items to see and buy :) designed by the late iraqi architect Zaha hadid, at located near metro station, with fashon malls near buy"
116,4.0,Dongdaemum is very good area for shopping and events. and  design of this building is special and beautiful at night when light is on. Good for picture taking.
117,4.0,A fascinating building in the heart of Seoul. The building dominates the view as you emerge from the subway. We enjoyed going inside and seeing all of the modern design ideas that were for sale.
118,5.0,"It doesn't matter how late it is, this is a great place to shop.  Building after building of shops.  I can spend whole day and night here."
119,4.0,"It is an architecture wonder, and it is definitely worth a visit to see it. It also shows the history of the stadium and before that."
120,4.0,It's a good place to chill and take pictures in it. It's usually the place for seoul fashion week so trendy people hang out here. it's 5-10 minute walk from dongdaemun shopping street too. At the time for our visit there was a dance exhibit so pretty cool and artsy too.
121,5.0,"At the end of a long day, I had just enough energy to catch the subway about 4-5 stops from our hotel to check out Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Boy, am I glad I did! it's spectacular at night - especially the buildings' lighting and the LED rose garden. Visit at night!"
122,5.0,"This place was a bit overwhelming as we had limited time in the area. There were several shopping malls in this area, one next to the other. According to our guide, the mall we went to (I think it was called ""good morining"" or something to that effect) was the best (and cheapest) place to get souvenirs and gifts for friends and loved ones. There were also so many interesting food choice establishments. This place definitely worth going back to and exploring."
123,4.0,Best visited from the outside at night but also pretty special during the day as you can visit the museum etc between 10am and 9pm. The bed of illuminated LED roses are pretty special too.
124,4.0,"Really cool architecture and had a great time checking out all the lights from adverts nearby. It's like being inside of a pin ball machine, so much happening and lots of sounds and smells. Our entire family spent the whole evening just enjoying the modern architecture and meeting some talented young artists nearby. This is a perfect gathering spot to do something or just sit and enjoy doing nothing. The designs are amazing and so creative. Truly an enjoyable evening. Best thing was the cost = $0"
125,4.0,"Unfortunately when me and my family reached the place it started to rain heavily as such many open air performance was cancelled, however still managed to see beautiful piano recital being played. There are ample eateries and shops inside The DDP occupies 85,000 sq meters of space with many exhibition halls. However owing to the heavy rain,  we were unable to walk the roof Park."
126,4.0,Unfortunately we came there when there was no event. Also I wish I came at night  when the led roses are lit.   Nevertheless the structures and the ground are stunning.
127,5.0,"My son and I walked through this uniquely designed art building and purchase a great deal of local artist and designers who items were being sold. The shopping spaces are set up like  incubators, giving each designer their own space."
128,3.0,The highlight was the children's play area where my 6 year old grandson spent most of the time.  Some interesting designs - loved the ceiling decoration - a circle made from sticks.
129,4.0,"This place had been reviewed in so many places that I have to admit that even though I had an enjoyable afternoon, i was a little disappointed after the hype. The architecture was indeed unusual with a lot of feminine round forms but since it was so big, when we came up close, maybe we couldn't appreciate it as much. There were three areas for us to go to - a marketplace, a design centre and a museum area. The marketplace has a lot of clothes and food store. The design centre had nice things for sale and it was buy some knick-knacks. The museum has temporary exhibits so when we came there was a Korean art exihibit and a Gaultier exhibit, each one with a separate paid entry. There was also a children exhibit for about USD 4/child but it looked kinda lame so we didn't go in. All in all, good day to spend the afternoon on a rainy day. If one comes in the evening, it would be better because there is a free light exhibit on until February"
130,5.0,"When you get tired from all those shopping across the street, Dongdaemun is a good place to wind down and relax those tired feet. I didn't have time to go inside so I went to where the LED lit garden is. It's beautiful! I haven't seen a garden so creatively done and it's definitely not any usual gardens you'll see. It's futuristic and it adds more to the architecture's brilliance. See some pictures I took. DDP looks better at night. It's open for everyone and has an exit going to the train station."
131,3.0,modern architecture and great for picture taking at any angle and floor.  underneath you can find a major subway station with subway maps.
132,4.0,Must visit place if you're into architecture. It is designed by the only female designer that have ever won an Oscar equivalent award in Architecture
133,4.0,DDP is a really cool area.  There are a lot of things to do here.  Some of it is free.  A trip at night is worth it.  There is a $ Childrens area inside called iPlay.  It is worth the money especially on a rainy day.  There is a subway station and a mall.  Plenty of options to eat.
134,5.0,"This building is an architect dream running wild (we had on architecture student in our group). I  give it five stars as a visitor, however I am not sure if it is useful. I think that there are too many empty spaces in a crowded city. But the impact you get arriving by metro is huge. I guess many Sci Fi movies/tv shows use this a location."
135,3.0,modern design & very contemporary. this place is filled with new quirky and hipster items. made our 3d figurines with friendly owner who used to study in ballarat :)
136,5.0,"for art and architecture lovers, this is a must place to visit. it was design by the late Dame Zaha Hadid. the building is amazing to see in both day and night!"
137,5.0,"A must visit to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, best is night visit. With its lights lit on, best photo can be captured around this plaza"
138,3.0,"My husband and I went there when the kids were going to Everland for the day.  We were clueless on what to expect when we went to this place.  It was totally different from the old world that South Korean places we've been to.  The place is for those who are into unique architectural design.  Unfortunately, on the day we went, nothing much was happening."
139,5.0,Just visited this nice place again in one and a half year. I love the building and the look from the outside especially at night time. The lights were showing through the little windows and made you dream. I went on Monday so that I could only shop at the inside the museum. You will find very smart design items there and it was unique.
140,4.0,Beautiful architecture. Very impressive building right in the middle of the shopping area. Good shopping and dining options around the building too.
141,4.0,With good design. Some design shops. Can have a look for 2 hours. Can stay during rain. Good for teenagers. Many restaurants worth to visit.
142,4.0,My niece had seen this building featuring Korean K pop shows on TV and was excited to see this building for real while walking to Dongdaemen Malls. It was lovely from the outside as we went late at night but the led lights lit up the building. I love the shape of the building and went back another night just to walk around it again. One of the most beautiful buildings in Seoul.
143,5.0,visited this for the LED white roses. didn't disappoint.. brilliant idea to attract visitors to this place.
144,5.0,"Walking through a marvel architecture outside subway station at night, we are amazed by the light up on and off on the wall of the huge buildings. The landmark of futuristic building is centerpiece for tourist site, especially at night next to Yigansumun Exhibition Hall, there are around 25.550 electronic roses that light-up after 6 p.m. It's spreading out over a distance and its very beautiful!"
145,5.0,"Hardly anybody. Very quiet. Went up to the highest floor and from there it was a continuous spiral corridor down to the ground floor, just unleashed the kids and let them roll down the corridor was petty fun. The outdoor space was huge and shaded so the kids can expend their energy :) all this after they were good and let mummy do some shopping at Dotti :)"
146,4.0,"Incredible design..very unique.. suitable for art lovers. I went there almost every day during my trip last November.Near to ""ikan bakar"" place (popular among Malaysians)"
147,3.0,Just an usual mall and shopping centre. Only the architecture that good. It's suitable for architecture / interior design lover.
148,5.0,"So many store...!  So many activities within walking distance.  The first time we went there, we saw a puppet show and walked around to find a museum.  We found instead a really cool ancient sluice gate."
149,4.0,These look like Spaceship structure is very interesting. The area is huge as it consist of a few exhibition hall. I think its lack of shops and attraction around this area makes it feels a bit empty and quiet.
150,3.0,Visited three times to look around and went in once.  What a wonderful building but what a disappointment inside.  The design museum had a Korean painting exhibition on (not really design) and the Design Lab was just shops!  There was a Hyundai display but seemed to be the few pods outside we'd seen at night so overall not much inside - a waste of a stunning building
151,4.0,Great to check out the architecture of the building and sometimes they have free art exhibitions. Great for shutterbugs to capture some amazing shots as well!
152,5.0,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is located smack in the middle of the main city centre area of Dongdaemun. What can I say about this place? One word. Breathtaking.For the photo-enthusiast, whip out that camera of yours and take lots of pictures. I mean lots! Just look at the uploaded photos of mine! LOL.OK...about this place. This Design Plaza aka the Design Museum is very impressive from the point you exit from the train station with it's impressive futuristic facade right into the main belly of the location. I totally love this place to bits. The buildings are very organic, dynamic....seems like an neverending flow of contours. In short, it's like a scene from Star Wars. The expansive place is adorned with interesting structures,sculptures and this overhead bridge that really is nothing I've seen before really captures the spirit of this place. The spirit of Design and Innovation.In the main building, the interiors are minimalistic, white and very little sharp corners. It holds permanent exhibits and also special events as well.Don't miss this place. Feel what it feels like to be transported to the future. :)"
153,4.0,Very interesting place offering modern architecture.When we visited (November 2015) there was a fantastic exhibition by Italian Architecture Alessandro Mendini - which is highly recommended (for an extra payment).After that we walked around and enjoyed the inside and outside designs.The place offers some shopping which we did not much care for.
154,4.0,Very good place with interesting buildings. 1.  Night market is interesting. 2.  Access is very convenient from subway. (Line #5 #4 etc) 3. Daytime shopping is also very interesting. 4. But too touristic to buy. Because price is very high already if you go inside highrised buildings. 5.  Very goog sightseeing destination. :)
155,5.0,I love DDP. It's ridiculously stunning! This is a must for architecture and design lovers. Take the tour.
156,4.0,"nice looking structure in the middle of the a shopping area. Currently after sunset there is a LED rose garden lightup at one area (across from Doota) quite pretty !! have shops inside with a lot of quirky and fu stuff, worth a visit!"
157,5.0,This is an architecture without any angled corners and its huge when you stand right beside it.We passed by and took some photos. Didn't really go into the building.
158,4.0,"I'm very impressed with the engineering and architecture works. It is something beyond normal and pretty amazing. The building cantilever parts are very interesting and the curves looks so firm and flawless. The time I passing by this building, I can't let my eyes out of it."
159,5.0,We stayed within walking distance of the Dondaemun Design Plaza and the surrounding shopping areas.  We had so much fun going through all the stalls in the design plaza and going to the night market area.  Fashion at a reasonable price is the name of the game here.
160,5.0,"A definite highlight of my trip. It is a beautifully design structure. The Dongdaemun Design Plaza, also called the DDP, is a major urban development landmark in Seoul, South Korea designed by Zaha Hadid and Samoo, with a distinctively neofuturistic design characterized by the ""powerful, curving forms of elongated structures"".  It houses Art Hall, Museum, Design Lab, Design Market, and Dongdaemun History and Culture Park. We chose to visit it at night, all because for the beautifully lit LED flowers surrounding the plaza. It is a magnificent sight and very serene. If you have the time, do take a stroll inside the building."
161,3.0,"Not a very interesting place to visit. I thought it was a museum, but there were only shopping stores inside. The whole Dongdaeumn district is basically a giant shopping center."
162,4.0,"This place used to be a football stadium, partially demolished and revamped into the place it is. This place carries a lot of positive energy, with many youths hanging at almost every corner when night falls. Didn't visit the museum, but enjoyed my time just strolling around the place, then spend some time sitting down and enjoying the breeze."
163,4.0,"Amazing archaeological site hosted in contemporary architecture. Creative application of design, technology & aesthetic"
164,4.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a nice spot to come and gawk at the super cool architecture. It's also a great place to come and snap modern trip photos. There are sweeps of concrete that will be awesome in your ""look how cool I am hanging out in Seoul"" photo book.There's a great design shop at the bottom to browse. Inside there are normally several over-priced art shows that don't seem all that well curated – go to the MMCA instead, which is cheaper and usually has a better show on.But for free, it is cool to walk along the inside of the massive structure. It's like being in a set piece for 2001 a Space Odyssey.There are also food trucks outside, public sculptures and public art pieces to wander past and some archaeologic pieces from Korea's past that were unearthed in the run-up to construction of this design plaza, which are out on display."
165,4.0,Nice clean place to visit and beautiful area - We liked the shopping in area and architecture - Really nice place to walk around and enjoy view
166,4.0,"This building has a very interesting structure. I couldn't tell when I was up or down or which was I was going. Just when you think you have the hang of it, you're on the opposite side of where you thought you'd be!There are elevators but my friends and I were using the stairs so it was more confusing.The innovation of some of the products there were interesting but they went over my head!!!"
167,5.0,We've been touring the building & awed by its architecture. Truly amazing. But don't forget to check out 24/7 shopping buildings next door.
168,5.0,"I suggest visiting DDP before sunset to check out the place, shops, the then exhibitions as well as the relics. When night falls & the building lights  up, the portion near Lotte fitin is just like a spaceship, simply incredible. Don't miss out the sea of 25500 LED roses at the m3 rooftop garden, for limited time only till the end of Feb 2016. Though everland & other places do have LED gardens alike, this LED rose garden is more fascinating in such a neofuturistic setting.I have once visited the garden at 12:30am, very few people there and the atmosphere was surreal."
169,4.0,"At night the site is impressive, especially if you come from the northside downwards to lotte department store.  Also, do not forget to look and go behind the building , for the thousands of light up flowers."
170,5.0,We came at night since it was so hot during the day and I'm glad we did! The building was so beautiful with all it's curves and lines. There is so much to see so try and plan your visit ahead of time. Look around and be in awe of a beautiful masterpiece in a city of such history.
171,5.0,"First we did not understood what this strange building was. We had to take a closer look and wooow, it was so fancy! We spent a lot of time just walking around and enjoyed it!"
172,5.0,"The whole architecture has four functional sections, with each one has its own utility and also connected to each other. The whole building is quite natural with its environment, harmoniously designed to be interconnect to an ancient trail."
173,4.0,Great architecture and interior. Good exhibition (365 exhibition). Too bad if you don't understand Korean. Would be more universal if there are more English information and English speaking staffs.
174,5.0,"i recomend to visit on evening until night, the light really amazing and breath taking, This one also opened recently,and it has exhibitions happening every week. A few months ago, they were displaying scenes from the drama “My Love from Another Star.” During this weekend they had the Pikachu Parade (which happened only once on Saturday because they couldn’t handle the crowd), and right now they still have the LED Flower Garden"
