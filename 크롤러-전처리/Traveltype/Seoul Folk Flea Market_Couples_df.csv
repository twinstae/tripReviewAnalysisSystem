0,5.0,A real hidden gem.  Our driver suggested this place and we were not disappointed.  Some really top quality items at bargain prices enabled us to wipe out our shopping needs in one stop.
1,5.0,"We came with no presumptions other than the fact it was called a flea market, so we didn't expect to see anything in particular. We were both very pleasantly surprised to see so many film cameras from the early 1900s to mostly 1960-1980 era cameras. We marvelled at the variety of them and their charm. Definitely a must visit for any camera enthusiasts. Other than the cameras there is plenty of other old school electronics to be seen and military clothing as well as other used clothing, there is a cool Whiskey/Brandy stall too where we bought some very nice Japanese whiskey to have on a special occasion   Food court looked great too."
2,2.0,"There antique market actually includes a antique mall, stalks and street vendors (ouside the mall) that sell antiques, second hand furniture, clothing, accessories, camera, and many more.  You can find some authentic designer handbags and a lot of knock-offs.The antique mall building is the focal point of the area.  The space of the ground level is very tight and things seem to be a mess.  The second level is a lot better and stores are more organized and clean.  There is also a public washroom on the second level.We did not find anything interesting and spent just about an hour there.  No need to visit if you are not interested in these things."
3,3.0,"I'm sorry, but I'm just not into buying other peoples junk.  We went hoping to find some craft shops selling local stuff, but what we found were piles and piles of junk.  Anything you can imagine piled to the ceiling, rows and rows of it.If your looking for some battery charger for a 1970 widget, you can find it there."
4,4.0,"If you're looking for shopping like Myeongdong or Dongdaemun you'll be disappointed. But if you like antiques, odds and ends sold by everyday Koreans and antique dealers, you'll enjoy the visit. The building itself has a general shopping area (the usual clothes, socks, hats etc), but - to me anyway - the real gem was the antique section on the ground floor plus all the street vendors around the building (bric a brac etc). One man's trash is another man'a treasure - found some interesting things!Access through the Sinseol-dong station. Exit 9. Turn around straight away. Turn left at next street. Walk straight for about 70m. Best on weekends."
