0,1.0,Very bad service to tourist. Ms Jina. If you’re not ready to be a service oriented person why be on the line? The place is not friendly for tourist to ask information.
1,5.0,한국을 여행하는 분들에게 정보를 얻기 좋은 곳입니다. 무료로 한복 체험도 할수 있고 한식을 먹어 볼수도 있어서 추천합니다. Recommend biz tourists near Gwanghwamoon area who do not have much time to look aroud Seoul or Korea. This is good place to learn Korea culture and cusine as well as try Korean traditional costume.
2,1.0,"I brought luggage cause I needed help with camping in Korea. They were friendly and helpful, then suddenly the employee I was speaking to suggested I go to the elevator, go down to the first floor and leave the building. She said I had too much luggage. In the west, that sort of suggestion is more of a threat that they will call security or the police in you, but they are too cowardly to make a clear threat.I think they like to judge people based on their appearance and they see me as a piece of garbage. I guess they feel okay with it and won't mind a few people being made aware that they are greedy, dishonest, phony people. In my opinion.I felt hostility so I didn't want to stick around to learn about their cultural heritage. I'm not in a mood to be sensitive to their culture, right now."
3,4.0,"This Tourist Information Centre is located in a large modern office building. I must have been very slow on the day that I visited as I thought that the place was restricted to the 2nd floor and so spent my whole time wandering around there. My impression was that it was quite modern & highly organised with a plethora of leaflets, maps and little booths describing many things to do and places to visit in the country. I grabbed a bunch of stuff which I thought could be helpful, acknowledged the fact that they also had a little coffee shop area to add to the other 88.500 odd coffee shops in this country (2017 figures!!!) and went out to find somewhere nearby to have breakfast.Unlike me, if you come here (which you should do) you might want to also visit the other floors and tell me about them on this platform :-)"
