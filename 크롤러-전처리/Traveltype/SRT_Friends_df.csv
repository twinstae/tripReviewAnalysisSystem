0,5.0,"1st time visiting South Korea, first time using SRT train to Busan from Seoul (and vice versa) Only Koreans can purchase tickets online as per what I read. Unless you have a Korean friend to help, if not, just buy at the departing station (eg. Purchase ticket to Busan at Suseo Station in Seoul) few days before. The counter staffs can speak English so no need worry about language barrier. They will explain to you the ticket details as well (there is a little English on the ticket too). There is ticket vending machine in Busan Station with English options. I suggest to buy ticket few days prior your planned departure date as the trains on the day might be fully booked."

2,5.0,"My friend and I took the SRT from Busan to Seoul while we were in Korea. We got first class seats cheaper on the SRT than on the KTX (economy). The seats were big and comfy, they had plenty of storage for our luggage (Two american girls who were in Korea for three weeks and brought a spare suit case for shopping...we had a lot of luggage).  We were given snacks and bottled drinks for our ride. The staff was nice and friendly, they helped us get our luggage off the train and pointed us in the correct direction for our subway connection."
3,4.0,"This indeed will lead one to the Gangnam area in Seoul directly. Thus one will not have to face the heavy traffic directly. However, some improvements I think will make the experience a better one: (1) such as the air circulation in the train is not adequate, which means the lack of oxygen will easily put everyone to sleep!(2) location of the clothe's hooks are not at the appropriate position to let the passengers use effectively. They are  useful only as decoration!(3) there are no cup/bottle holder for passengers who wants to drink or have a cup of coffee.  (4) feeling how shaky the train is moving on some part of the track, it is indeed questionable about the track's quality is good enough for high speed travelling."
4,5.0,"I have used to KTX from Seoul to Busan a couple times. Fare is around 50,000 one way. Is fast, clean and convenient. Now the SRT from Suseo makes it even more convenient cause it gets to Pyeongtaek and even Mokpo on the southwest part of the country."
