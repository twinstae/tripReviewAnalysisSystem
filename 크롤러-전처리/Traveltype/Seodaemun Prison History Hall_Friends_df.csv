1,5.0,"Nowadays, Koreans can enjoy a modern, democratic and independent country. There are many factors in South Korea‚Äôs success. In order to understand why South Korea is the way it is now, we have to look back in the past to see how everything started and to understand a long, painful way Koreans have passed.Empire of Japan had interests in seizing the Korean peninsula. In 1905, they made Korea their colony, finalizing in effective annexation in 1910. Korean emperor, Gojong, tried to seek for help from western powerful countries but nobody came to the rescue and Japanese could colonized, with violence, Korea. Few can imagine all the suffering and oppression that Koreans had to live during Japanese colonial rule. Japan ruled directly through the military and any Korean dissent was ruthlessly crushed. They build a colonial prison in 1908 that served as a major site of oppression during Japanese forced annexation. Seodaemun Prison, firstly named Gyeongseong Prison, was built to accommodate 500 inmates, considering that the entire capacity of all prisons around the country was of 300 inmates only, but as Japanese full-scale aggression initiated into Korea, many Koreans independence activist started rising. Therefore, these fighters got arrested and imprisoned there, raising the population of the prison reaching more than 3000 people around 1919 as many patriots were imprisoned during the March 1st Independence movement. Until independence was achieved in 1945, many independence fighters were executed or died from the brutal treatment received in the prison.Metal bars, cold bricks and guards from the prison could not silenced loud voice seeking for restoration of sovereignty nor could break down their loyal spirit inherited from the Righteous Army in the Joseon dynasty. Within the prison‚Äôs corridors ‚ÄúDaehan Dongnip Manse!‚Äù (Long live the independence of Korea) could always be heard. And little by little, it started uniting all Koreans into one purpose, independence. Korean independence activists created organizations domestically and overseas were they planned resistance strikes. They used many strategies as a method to push forward the recovery of Korea‚Äôs national sovereignty, especially the ‚ÄòHeroic Struggle‚Äô, in my opinion is the smartest tactic that could be done considering the conditions they were living in, which targeted Japanese figures and pro-Japanese Koreans with violence trying to make heavy blows to the Japanese imperialists.Nowadays, Seodaemun prison is a museum that shows all the pain and struggle that patriots suffer within its prison cells. You can see how their spirit was unbreakable and you can share all the oppression and humiliation caused by Japanese. Even though the prison is empty, the independence patriots‚Äô spirit can still be felt.100 years has passed since the March 1st Movement rallied the Korean people against oppressive Japanese colonialism. This epoch-making movement, their actions and their activist should never be forgotten because from it we can learn that freedom and peace are not given for free, you must fight for them. We should keep this legacy of our ancestors and treasure it because these are two biggest gifts we could inherit. In order to have a brighter and better future, it is important to learn from our past. As a final remark, we think, Yu Gwan-Sun words: ‚ÄúEven if my fingernails are torn out, my nose and ears are ripped apart, and my legs and arms are crushed, this physical pain does not compare to the pain of losing my nation‚Äù wraps the inherit spirit of every Korean."
2,5.0,The place is starting to get crowded because they are celebrating their March 1 Independence movement.  You can tour the whole facility for 45mins - 1.5hrs.Close to Seodaemun Independence park.
3,4.0,"A visit to the Seodaemun Prison will leave a lasting impression. We went on a calm Sunday morning. From the subway station (exit 5) you will walk straight to the former prison. The museum details the cruelties commited by the Japanese in the early 20th century, but gives little information about the time when the prison was in use during the second half when a lot of Koreans whom critiques the Korean government were imprisoned there."

5,4.0,"This location does not really pop out when one searches for places to see in Seoul. This historical site is very touching and biographies of those who have suffered under Japanese Colonial rule is very sad. Tour of all the buildings and walking the ground should take about 1-2 hours. 3,000 won for Adults1,500 won for Teenagers1,000 won for Children1,500 won for Soldiers"
6,5.0,"Seodaemun Prison History Hall is a monument of Korean history which chronologically illustrates Korean history of last 110 years. That alone is a reason why visitors of Seoul must visit that place. By visiting it, each individual can understand that part of Korean history and incredible power of will of Korean people to stand for themselfs. So it is a must see attraction in SeoulüòÄ"
7,5.0,"It was a worthwhile trip and educational for us as we learnt about the prisoners of war and how they were tortured. We were able to see the cells too, the gallows and many more. Good experience!!"
8,4.0,"This is one of the only Museums that you have to pay for, but even so I have been to this place three times now. The compound is a nice escape from the busy streets of Seoul and the information inside is very educational. They have pamphlets in English, Chinese, and Japanese. Most of the information panels are in English and Hangul. However, the prisoner stories tend to only be in Korean."
9,4.0,"Right by Dongnimmun St. Exit 5. Entrnace fee is 3,000 KRW. There is a small gift shop with good souvenirs from the place. Two floors. Good piece of history"
10,4.0,"Every country had a war , revolution or something like that. But when you see the real places understand life has a bitter taste for them. Dont miss the photo gallery at the end of museum."
11,4.0,"We went on a tour with an english speaking guide which made it much more interesting. Some of the signs are in english, but not all.This prison was used during the Japanese occupation and then after independence it was used as a regular prison until just before the Olympics (1987).  You certainly hear a lot about the brutality of the Japanese during this time and they spirit of the Koreans who fought against it.  It is certainly horrible to see how people were kept in tiny cramped cells and the torture they endured, just because they wanted their country to be free.  We didn't hear so much about how the prison was operated after the Japanese left or what sort of people were kept there.Much of the prison has been rebuilt as a memorial for future generations.It is in a very nice park at the foot of a Mountain.  It is easily accessible from/right next to, Dongnimmum metro station and costs about W3000 to get in. Only for those with a particular interest in such things."
12,4.0,"Very well maintained, a lot of nice artifacts and displays.  Very friendly workers.  A nice place to visit to learn more about a different somewhat tilted side of Korean history.  Only drawback too much emphasis on how great and how hard the righteous Korean people fought off the yoke of Japanese occupation.  Nothing mentioned about the United States defeating the Japanese for Korea to regain its independence, or how many Koreans were snitches and spies who worked for the Japanese Kempeitai.  Nothing mentioned about how many teenagers President Park Chung Hee imprisoned there when he was president for tearing down a political poster and beaten to confess that it was his father‚Äôs idea (my father-in-law) to do that like what happened to my brother-in-law in 1971.  Overall a very nice day trip in conjunction with a walk down to Independence Park."
13,4.0,"Old prison from the Japanese colonial era turned into a museum. There is a lot of information, signage also available in English. There is also a large portion of the outside grounds available to walk around and see. Even though I went on a weekend, it wasn't very crowded as it isn't a top tourist attraction, though I do suggest a visit here to see a different side of Seoul and it's history. The whole complex can easily be seen in little more than one hour. Photos are allowed."
14,4.0,"I visited this attraction because I am a huge history buff. The prison was built in the early 20th century and it gives an idea of what life was like for prisoners during Korea's colonial period. You can walk the grounds, and you can step foot inside the cells. There are mannequins depicting the horrible atrocities committed against the prisoners. There is even an opportunity to stand inside one of the Korean torture devices, which is a cubby hole (read: small closet) without any extra room. If you are over five feet, nine inches tall you are going to be extremely uncomfortable in this thing! And we read that some prisoners were left in there for days!We hired a tour guide who spoke excellent English. He walked us through the various buildings and rooms. He explained what life was like for the prisoners back when the facilities were in operation.Seoul is an exciting and bustling city. The streets  along the main thoroughfares are clean and the infrastructure can handle the population's mobility. Visiting this ancient prison was like stepping into a time warp. You certainly got a feel for a time that has since passed.I would recommend this attraction. You only need to spend two hours there, at the most. But be sure to get a guide. The memories will last forever."
15,5.0,"The prison hall museum offered a moving view of the deep struggles of those who fought for freedom. Some parts were difficult to see and some parts are not translated in English, but this doesn't take away from it being a very significant experience. You get to see how the prisoners were held and how they died. Very moving experience."
16,4.0,"I visited the prison with my dad and it was truly an amazing experience. We could really feel the history and I got a feeling what country my father lives in. I understand the silent issue between the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese. But I'm proud that they have saved this history to share. It gave me goosebumps. Definitely worth a visit"
17,4.0,I have a big interested in history for a long time. I have read about north and south Korea conflicts before but I never know about this side of history when it comes to Japanese invasion. Knowing how tough this country has been through it feels a bit sad. Besides standing in the actual event place is even more sadder. For more than 80 years of the dark history this place will show you the prison that actually was to contain all the Koreans who fought for the liberation. Also underground of this prison was the place where they tortured them to dead. It's a really nice place to visit and you will know how bad we need peace in this world.
18,3.0,"It's an open park with historic buildings, you can still see where the executions were held and depressing prison preserved."
19,5.0,"If you're a history buff, this is a sit not to be missed when vising Seoul. It's a heartwrenching experience yet fascinating at the same time. A part of Korea's painful past, this site will help to understand why Koreans still criticize Japan for their colonialism of Korea. The tour is well laid out and history comes alive."
20,5.0,When I went to this old prison with one of my Korean friends it really touch me in my seoul. The brutality of the guards but also the pain and perseverance of the prisoners. It was amazing to see and feel that. This prison is part of the history and will remain that. As future generations will also need to see this. Foreigners will also learn a lot and understand the uncomfortable situation still with Japan even though it is improving.
21,5.0,"A fantastic insight to what it was like when Japan colonized and how they went about to eradicate the language, education, and culture of Korea. So sad, but we see how a young college girl becomes a martyr for her country. The daily life of the prison reminds of the Civil War POW prisons in the US. This single sight is forever etched in my memory to portray the struggles of Koreans under Japanese rule."
22,5.0,Truly a moving experience. This is a definite must see to witness the atrocities and capabilities of mankind. After this visit it certainly changed my perspective on the Japanese culture and treatment of Koreans. Would fully recommend visiting and paying homage to the souls that were taken during the occupation.
23,4.0,"Seodaemun Prison is an important place to visit while in Seoul as it explains the complicated relationship between Japan and Korea.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Japan occupied Korea bringing with it great oppression while forcing the people to take on Japanese customs.  Of course, this was met with a lot of resistance.  Because of this, many Koreans were taken to Seodaemun for questioning and were tortured by the Japanese, the most famous Ryu Gwan-sun.Many of the factory buildings are gone, but the museum‚Äôs main buildings still include some cells that housed prisoners, torture chambers, and many exhibits explaining this time in history.  I think the most powerful part of Seodaemun Prison was the room which included hundreds of photos of people who had been imprisoned there.  It was pretty powerful to see the faces of the people who would try to hold onto their country at any cost, including death.This museum may not be for everyone especially if you are not into history, but for 3,000 won and the chance to learn a little more about the history of modern Korea made it worth it for me.Be warned, many of the displays are in Korean only which may be frustrating to some.  Also, during the week, there are a lot of school groups making it cumbersome to navigate through large groups of children at times, but in the end, it was still worth it as it's a very powerful museum."
24,4.0,"This is the first prison museum I've visited. The atmosphere is very sombre and there is quite a lot to see and learn. It actually made me feel quite sad visiting this place knowing so many people suffered and died here. They have cells you can go in and some torture devices and you can kind of imagine what it was like for prisoners back then, horrible. They have a memorial hall where they have thousands of pictures of the prisoners... very heavy and sad place.... I wouldn't go again, but it was a good experience. I think I went on a weekday and it wasnt too crowded but still a few too many kids than I would have liked :PAnyway, good visit, probably about 2 hours. Also the surrounding are is nice for a walk too."
25,5.0,"One wouldn't call this place fun, by any means, but they have done a wonderful job of portraying the brutality of such prisons and of describing a painful part of Korea's history.  It's easy to move around here, there are lots of open spaces between buildings, and it's right on the subway line.  People interested in history, and in Korean history in particular, should definitely take the time to visit this important site."
26,3.0,"Its an interesting museum, but 90-95% of the writing to explain stuff is in Korean. Walking here is interesting but with the lack of any explanation it is hard to understand what is what.When I went there was a school trip which consisted of kids that looked the age of 8 going to a prison museum, an interesting school trip I do say. From what you can understand, it shows what the prisoners went through during their time."
27,5.0,"This prison was built in the early 1900s by the Japanese and is kept as a historical reminder of what happened to Koreans during this time. It is a very sad, eye opening museum. Walking through the prison and seeing the cells where people were tourtured was a harrowing experience. The prison is very cheap to enter- only a few thousand won, and you can look around at your own pace- either with or without headphones.  If you go in winter, be sure to wrap up extra warm- it was colder inside the old prison than out!"
28,5.0,"Seodaemun prison history hall tells a very important story about the korean history. It is a scary place in a beautiful place. The museum has been restored with great thought and humbleness. This is not a place somone is making money on, the entrance fee is just symbolic and there¬¥s no souvenir shop. There are some vending machines with drinks for the same price as outside. I would definetely recommend a visit."
29,4.0,"Although small and sparse, this attraction tries its best to tell the history of how the Japanese used this prison to suppress Korean revolutionaries and uprisings.It shows the ways the Japanese tortured and interrogated prisoners - can be rather frightening. It also allows visitors to enter a prison cell to show the size of it. You can also visit the execution ground.It is definitely educational and gives visitors a short lesson on modern Korean history."
