0,5.0,"I have been avoiding the casinos in Seoul because of all the horrible reviews that i read on this and other travel sites.I was walking around the Coex last weekend and passed by this casino and outside there were horribly large queues of visiting asian foreigners brought here by the tour- bus loads. I asked one of the staff outside when was a good time to avoid such noisy crazy crowds. He told me ‘come mornings’.  So today (Saturday) i did exactly that. I arrived at 11am. There was nobody outside and the casino itself was 30% full (my estimate). Everyone from the entry clerk to the dealers and pit bosses were super friendly and super helpful, speaking excellent English. It took very little time to get acquainted with the minor variants in play (like the count down timer that determines when to shuffle the card shoe at the BJ tables. The minimum bet at the lowest buy-in BJ table was a respectable KWN 30,000, and there were plenty of open seats. I cannot understand how the reviews could be so far away from experience i had here. Maybe non-gamblers trying to trash the reputation ir maybe they arrived when the flood of wizzened elderly ladies (i’m 60+ so i can use that term without it being age discrimination) were bussed in. But go here at 11am on a Saturday and you will find a very pleasant experience with a friendly helpful english speaking staff."
1,3.0,"After Reading all the bad reviews, I was scared to visit the casino. But I had a nice surprise when I got there. The casino had a nice entrance. And inside was clean and kinda big. I have seen much worse casinos so I was very glad ! They had free coffee and tea and juice. There s just one roulette table (with their own order of numbers which is very tricky when u are used to the same roulette numbers in general) and several blackjack and baccara. The minimum was 50000W which is high.  Over all you can spend a nice time gambling. The only major problem was like 90% were chinses people who were screaming and taking all the tables, so hard to find a free seat."
2,1.0,"Worst casino and staff I have ever been to. Interesting that everyone at the front desk not only cant speak a word of english, but dont even try to explain things to you. I was given false information that caused alot of inconvenience for me."
3,4.0,First visit to Seven Luck Casino as I was spending half a day at Coex and Seven Luck Casino was just next door to Coex.
4,2.0,"As an avid world gamer from California, I would skip this casino if you are looking for anything that resembles Las Vegas or Macau. It's not a high end place like Monte Carlo in the South of France region either. For a CA native, it would be closest to a whole in the wall Indian Casino that is bursting at the seems with Mainland China gamblers who are pushy and lack common western concepts of personal space. Baccarat tables had a minimum of 10,000W with the only free space at Texas Hold em tables with 200,000W minimum bets per hand at 11pm.Stereotypical customer service with a foreigner only admitted policy. You must show your foreign passport at the door, with a very unfriendly feel from the entrance. You have to take an escalator to the 2nd floor to view an electronic dealer version of roulette, black jack with high minimums, and Baccarat with no house commissions as a slight plus.Overall, not worth a visit unless you are with a group of friends with money burning a hole in your pockets. I would recommend a trip to Las Vegas or Macau for some real gaming atmospheres."
