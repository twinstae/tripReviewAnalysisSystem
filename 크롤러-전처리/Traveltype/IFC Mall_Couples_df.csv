1,2.0,"If you are looking for clothing, this mall only has a few major brand name stores. Do not be confused by IFC 1, 2, and 3. It is all a part of one mall despite the three entrances. It is rather small compared to malls in the U.S. The food court is decent but you will most likely only spend a few hours here. They have Zara, Mango, Gap, and Uniqlo. There is no HnM."
2,3.0,"IFC was advertised as a huge centre for shopping and activities, but itâ€™s actually so boring, the design was not impressive, scale is around middle, not many shopping attracts can be found here. Myeongdong street is a suggestion for any shopping lover."
3,5.0,We wandered through the mall.  It is clean and very busy.  Many choices for shopping with an entire level dedicated to food.  Plenty of choices for food/dining.
4,4.0,"This is not the grandest of malls but for the area it is really good.  The area seems to be pretty business office saturated with not much retail.  This mall helps fill the void.  It is connected to the subway so that helps with access.  The stores are most of your larger name brand stores, not overly expensive but nice stores for sure.  The most ""local"" thing in the mall is the food court at the lower level as it has a mix of foot court food along with restaurants.  No reason not to visit if you are inclined to do so."
5,4.0,"The IFC (International Financial Center) Mall is a nice, medium-sized western-style mall in the Yeuido neighborhood. It is not located in the center of the action, which is what I like about it! You can access the mall easily from the subway. Stores and restaurants are what you would expect: Banana Republic, Uniqlo, H & M, etc. Most restaurants are located on the lowest level, though there are a few on the second-to-lowest level. It's a nice, relaxing place to wander around. As a tourist, if you spend more than $30.00 (and, I believe, less than $200.) you can get a refund on your taxes at the airport when you are leaving Korea."
6,3.0,"The mall is huge, I liked the modern architecture but nothing amazing in the mall. As we stayed at the Conrad and they have limited options for dining, we went to the food court. I was so into the Korean dishes, so ended up with a Korean spicy soup set. It was alright. Try some egg tarts at PARIS BAGUETTE. They are so good. I would give a higher rate to Times Square at Yondongpo. They have more variety of restaurants plus E-mart."
7,4.0,If you're looking for shopping particularly if it's a rainy cold day this is the place for you. It's gotta chill atmosphere and its not as busy as other areas in Korea.
8,4.0,My wife and I visited Seoul and stayed at the Conrad Hotel. The IFC Mall is situated below the Hotel and therefore we greatly enjoyed walking through the stylish arcade and both of use found something to buy that makes us happy. The shopping mall is on three levels whereby the lowest floor is reserved for various restaurants and a food court.The Metro can also be conveniently reach by walking through the Mall.
9,4.0,One of the best designed and most comfortable shopping malls we have ever visited. Blend of top class and medium priced retail stores. Food court has good variety and a well operated ordering system. The restaurant choice is excellent and the Korean restaurant is authentic and good value. Perfect place when the weather is bad. We spent a rainy afternoon in the very comfortable cinema there!
