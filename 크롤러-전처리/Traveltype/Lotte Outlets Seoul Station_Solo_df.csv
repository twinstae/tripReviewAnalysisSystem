4,4.0,"Because The Korean festival Chuseok it has been difficulties to find shopping places which are reasonably priced and open!  Seoul seems to be closed last week. These Lotte outlets are just above Seoul station, when you come up on escalator. Clothing for women, men and also to kids, shoes and toys.On the same level there is also a huge Korean supermarket, the only one I have seen during my 7 day stay in Seoul in our surroundings."
5,4.0,"Don’t look elsewhere for Korean edible stuff, just make your way to this supermarket and you will find all kinds of products here, e.g. packet noodles, tea/coffee, seaweed, ginseng, pickles, soju, etc.  This place is very popular with tourists, like me.  I love to browse through most of the groceries in the food section and am especially fond of the packet noodles. There is food court within the supermarket for those who wish for quick bites.Plastic bags are not provided but you may buy a Lotte plastic bag at the checkout counter to pack your things.  Nevertheless, cardboards are provided f.o.c at the self-packing section.  Tourists can enjoy tax refund for KRW30,000 purchases but don't forget to bring your passport.Happy Shopping!"

7,4.0,"It is right next to Seoul train station and right outside of Seoul station subway stop. There are tons of shops and things to buy, it's pretty much a giant department store. Although it's not very wide or lengthy, there are a lot of floors to explore. If you have a bit of time before your train departs, I suggest going up the escalators and window shop. You might like something there."
8,4.0,Great place if you seek good deals on good brands. There are eating outlets too for your convenience.
9,5.0,"I have forgot my jacket , in a rainy day, had KTX train to Ulsan , in expensive city such Seoul here i found qualified jacket to purchase and go on travel."
10,5.0,"I ended up having to use the KTX because bus tickets were sold out at the Nambu bus station, and I'm so glad I did! The Seoul station was very spacious, clean, and easy to navigate. Taking the train is a bit more expensive than by bus, but was much faster and really comfortable. It includes bathrooms and snack services like when you are on an airline. I would highly recommend traveling in this fashion."
11,4.0,"There is the Lotte Outlets which sell mainly clothing, shoes and bags, the Lotte Supermarket is just next door, there is a food court and restaurants at the Lotte Outlets Seoul Station, can buy and eat before heading to Incheon Airport."
12,4.0,"Access is remarkble since it is located beside Seoul station.Not so big nor diversfied as other outlets mall like Time square, Lotte World Mall, Coex Mall.No speciallity cannot be found. Ordinary shopping mall.It is bridged over Lotte Mart."
13,2.0,"Outlet shopping should be synonymous with outlet prices. However, if anyone has been to outlet malls in countries like USA and Europe, you will struggle to find anything of acceptable value. This Lotte outlet is only suitable for people who have never been to an outlet mall in other countries and also for mainland Chinese tourists who do not mind paying extra for everything as long as the items are cheaper than their home country. I the prices of some items I saw were a lot more expensive than the normal prices in Singapore. The only reason as to why I am rating this as 2 star is its location and you do not need to invest a lot of time to get there."
14,1.0,I should have gone in with low expectations... It's basically a giant Lotte store with similar prices and a good location. Not worth the hype.
