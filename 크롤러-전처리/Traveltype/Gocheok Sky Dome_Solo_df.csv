1,4.0,"Finally I got to go to the Skydome.   Generally, great stadium.   Well designed, looks great and holds the noise really well.  A few little glitches though.  There is not a lot of variety for food when attending a baseball game.   There are just a few chicken shops and a small convenience store or two.  Also, the service there could be a little better.   I know tonight was busy and all, but the servers there could ask more questions about the ticket people want, and the tickets could be a little clearer telling people about seating etc.   Generally though, the stadium is great and I am sure they will add more to it."
