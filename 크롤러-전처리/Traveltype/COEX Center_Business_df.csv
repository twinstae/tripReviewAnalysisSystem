0,4.0,The business I had in Seoul was at the World Trade Center Seoul located at the COEX so I was there everyday for 10 days and visited every facility located there.I’m particularly impressed with the Airline check in available there though it’s restricted in terms of airlines served. The Underground Starfield Mall is impressive and offers a wide range of shopping opportunities. There’s a good library located within the Mall. The Bongeunsa Temple is located just opposite the Mall. There’s also the “Gangnam Style Hand” that offers a great photo opportunity. It’s definitely worth a visit
1,3.0,"Although this convention center is shiny clean and well-located near the Seoul Station City Airport Terminal, where one can take an express bus from the international airport and even check-in on your departure day, I found its whole layout of the Coex convention center to be terribly confusing. My co-convention attenders were similarly confused and often lost, and often late to meeting sessions. Except for individual meeting rooms, the main building was HOT and very poorly air conditioned. I realize that the cost to keep it cool is high, but this was only June. I can only imagine how convention-goers suffer when it gets even hotter. Signs are poorly marked and the huge place only has a couple of 'help' desks where staff speak poor English. A plus is that there is a huge shopping and food mall located underneath the convention center. Of course, the goods are all international; with the exception of the food and perhaps tea for gifting to family and friends at home, it is not a shopping destination for Americans or others who are looking for something special that characterizes their experience in Korea. There are many high priced hotels nearby or  attached to the center. Good for avoiding the frequent rains in summer. Despite a few pluses, the overwhelming scope of and poor signage within COEX  makes me caution organizers of other large, international meetings, before selecting this location."

3,5.0,This place is an shopping paradise for the first timers like me. So many choices and so warm people. I bought lot of souvenirs and toys and chocolates for kids. There are so many awesome eateries inside. You can spend your entire day here easily.
4,3.0,"The center is big. But overall very similar to other exhibition center. It has Wifi but with difficulty to get connected sometime, especially during peak hour and the speed is a bit slow. The COEX mall at underfloor was closed for renovation during my visit. So can just stayed inside if feel bored during meeting."
