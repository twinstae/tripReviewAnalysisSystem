0,5.0,"We had such a great time here. There is an App you download when you go in which brings the place to life. We had so much fun taking videos and pictures and there is even an opportunity to get your portrait done as an oil painting, which was a great keepsake to take home. A great tip for couples, take a tripod so you can get shots of both of you!"
1,2.0,An overated and expensive museum.Disgusting toilets. The ice room was cold and smelly.There are some very funny parts though...
2,4.0,Had a lot of fun and took some crazy pics. There were indeed some eye bending displays that wow'd me. Was definitely worth it for me.
3,1.0,"I’m not sure why this place has received so many positive reviews. It’s a gimmicky place that is reminiscent of a Fun House at a County Fair. However, it is not at all suitable for children."
4,5.0,"The trip to the Love and Trick Eye Museum made me and my friends laugh the most. It was fun trying out the different illusions in each museum. And both museums have suggestions on the sides on how to pose and markings on where to stand to make sure you take the best pictures possible. However, the love museum is definitely for adults only. But the trick eye museum and ice museum is for practically anybody! It was really cold inside the ice museum so I suggest bringing something warm to wear if you want to last longer than 10 minutes in there. Overall 10/10 would recommend."
5,5.0,"I went to the Trick eye museum with a few of my friends. Trying the different poses was surprisingly fun. I had always wanted to try the height illusion and had a blast seeing the pictures of the illusions. Of course finding the right position takes some work but they have some example pictures on the wall that make it easier. The moon landscape was so beautiful, those pictures came out so pretty. We also did two of the virtual reality games and that was so fun. We all had a good laugh. 10/10 I recommend.The love and ice museum are also in the same building so we did those too and I was pleasantly surprised. Ice museum was really cold so we didnt last long in there but going down the ice slide was fun. And the love museum was a laugh but definitely for adults only 😂. Overall, had a great time."
6,5.0,There’s so many backgrounds to take pictures on so no doubt you’ll get great pictures. They even have certain place marks to stand on to get the best picture and to truly capture the illusion. It was a great opportunity to get some fun pictures with my friends. Highly recommend!
7,5.0,트릭아이 인생샷~!!!!친구랑같이 같는데 엄청 이쁜 포토존 많고 커플들도  찍을수 있는 곳도 많고 돋보이게 혼자 찍는 곳도 아주 재밌거나 이뻐요 .나와서 있는 VR은 방탄(BTS)도 탄거 같에요!! Trick Eye's life shot!I'm with my friend. There are so many pretty photo zones. I think we're on BTS too!I prefer 100%
8,4.0,"This is a place for selfie lovers, photographers... the technology is really cool to experience, can get a little frustrating as some people walk into your frame right as your about to take the pic. Note the ice section is absolutely freezing and very small. I was in and out of there in 3 minutes. You are required to download an app that allows you to experience the AR.Be sure to bring a power bank because omg, it drains your battery...."
9,4.0,"For $11 per person this was a fun experience. We got some pretty memorable photos, probably our favorite on the trip. Worth checking out if you're in the area."
10,3.0,"The visit was very interesting, some optical illusions were quite impressive and funny. However, you need to download the museum's app to use the proper camera inside ; it makes your phone heat up and lose battery quickly. I would recommend going right at the opening hour or during lunch because the rooms get crowded easily and it doesn't help you to make the most of the exhibit.Tip: we bought a ticket that included the entrance to the Trick Eye exhibit, the Ice Exhibit and the ""Beauty Inside"" exhibit - it's worth it!"
11,5.0,"I had a great time with my friends in the museum. I recommended them to go for taking photos and there is still the supermoon that can take beautiful picture. Friends were surprised to see the AR effect in the APP and it's new to my friends. Also, new corner is added near supermoon which can take pretty photos too."
12,5.0,Your ticket gets you access to the truck eye museum and the ice museum. After downloading their app 2-d paintings have 3-d movements. It was a lot of fun
13,5.0,"A nice place to go to if you enjoy taking pictures. At the time I went it wasn't too crowded, so pretty easy to take a picture. I believe if I had went at a busy time of the year it would of been difficult to take any pics since people tend to stand around forever and they tend to be in big groups. I also went to the ICE area where you can take pictures of objects made of Ice. It's a nice tourist attraction to spend a few hours."
14,1.0,"What ever you do, do not visit the Trickeye Museum. It is cheaply constructed and there are barely any optical illusions. All of us in our group were highly disappointed."
15,3.0,"The trick eye museum is great to take pictures in with friends, but it isn't overwhelmingly fun. It is only a small distance from Hongdae exit 9 which is handy - but I would only recommend it to kill 45 mins to an hour of your time if you are doing something else in Hongdae."
16,5.0,Really fun and LOTS of pictures plus you meet others who are willing to joke around as you take pics!Tons of variety when it comes to the pictures and creativity is involved heavily. Vr is amazing!
17,5.0,Nice museum. Ice museum is especially impressive. You should really check it out if you have some time in Seul
18,5.0,I had a great time with my friend. Definitely recommend this museum for groups. Fantastic opportunity to take an unusual photo.
19,5.0,This is a must do in Seoul. You can easily kill an hour here with friends. It’s a very interesting experience to have with the augmented reality
20,5.0,Definitely worth going. You can use the augmented reality app to take some really cool pictures. The ice section was very cold but realistic
21,5.0,A once in a lifetime experience best enjoyed with friends or family. It is definitely worth the price
22,5.0,Great place with lots of interesting things and definitely something different that is unique to Korea. A must visit when in Seoul!!!
23,5.0,Nice to see some takes on classical pieces in the museum. Fun place to go with a good fun group of friends.
24,4.0,"Wet/dry,  got( kids)  a bit of spare time, drink coffee with your image  on top, visit an ice attraction, and a TrickEye Museum... all in one place!!!!Photo opportunities abound. Order your coffee, your image is imprinted atop of the milk froth.. drink yourSelf!!!!Bit weird, but good gimmick.. coffee not great...rate. 6/10Then go to the Ice factory entrance.. some sculptures of Giant Panda, Korean children’s characters, chairs, slide..etc.. good photo opportunities for children etc Nothing out of the ordinary....Rate:  5/10Trick Eye Museum... entrance across from the Coffee shop!Inside are of  different scenes, that with the installed store  “photo app”, will make outthat one is actually taking part in the “supposed “ photo shoot”, whether it’s swimming with two sharks to riding with Pegasus and other scenes... quite realistic...Rate.... 7.5/10. Trick Eye for adults and/or kids..photo shots of differing aspects, with different positions, same scene.. can spend ????? Time!"
25,4.0,"It was one of our bucket list when in Seoul.  Fortunately, we were lucky to have guided by two students to reach Trick Eye Museum by foot from the train station.  Then we had the best experience inside it.  Somehow it amazed me on the 3D walls and floors....it was an unforgettable experience."
26,4.0,Trickeye Museum is very interesting and beautiful place for visiting. I really enjoyed so much even more than other places.
27,5.0,It is really nice place for tourist in seoul. I would like to strongly recommend to the visitors for visiting this amazing place at least once. Don't forget to visit Love musium and Ice musium too because these places are together with treckeye musium and very beautiful places as well.
28,5.0,We came to take a few pictures for our 4th date and we were impressed by the special effects. It was such a fun experience. My favorite was the huge piranha. Totally recommended if you like pictures with friends. And you must try the app.
29,5.0,One of my unforgettable experience in Seoul.  We took  amazing  pics that were really appreciated by friends and family.The 3D effect is super cool and the displays are diversified so all of my friends find their favorite spots!  Don't hesitate to visit that unique museum .
30,5.0,trick eye museum is really a nice place that every one coming to Korea should visit for taking photos
31,4.0,"The street is a small street. At basement of a old commercial building.You will be asked to download a trickeye app. Then whenever you stop at the camera sign of each spot. Hold your camera the image became alive.Explosion of volcano with fire, shark and fishes swimming to you, all the amazing effect become so real. Good family actitvites. Iceland location oppisite corner. A big commercial refridgerator with ice scrupture similar to what saw in Hokkaido japan in a much small scale. Suitable for children.Get your own image coffee at KRW8500. Firstly you take a selfie with the staff phone. The staff will prepare the coffee and foam with your photo. I ordered a hazelnut latte super thick cream! Good experience! Tips: Fully charge your phone. AR photo experience is very common in Seoul, 3D effect make your photos becone alive."
32,1.0,"Ok, so the only trick here is that they Rob you of 15000 won. We thought it was gonna be a illusion art exhibition, but it's silly bad animation all through an app on your phone, and it's all done in like 15 minutes. If you don't wanna be tricked for your money, stay away!!"
33,3.0,"What fun! Make sure you have a full charge on your phone. They provide free WiFi and you need to download their app.  Not all the exhibits were working, and those that did were mixed, some were fantastic and some boring. If you have used green screen at school then this type of thing will be nothing new. You pay for entry to the trick eye and the ice museum. Wrap up warm for that as the temperature is -4 degrees. There are just ice screens to take photos with, and an ice slide to come down. It's not very big.Worth a visit if the weather is poor or you have bored kids in tow."
34,5.0,"I went here with a friend. It was fun to take pictures in the crazy scenes and there were a variety to choose from: fantasy, scary, kitschy, fun."
35,5.0,"Saw this museum by walking in Hongdae with my friend, and we decided to go inside. Prices for tickets are reasonable, because we had a lot of fun in there. I was very surprised and happy that they created an application for the museum, and with application everything looks more realistic and in general museum is really worth to go to feel something unusual after a day routine. The corridor with mirrors in the end just made my day. Highly recommend!"
36,5.0,"Me and 4 other friends from University decided to visit the Trickeye Museum in Hongdae. You have to download an application that is called ""TrickEye"" in order to see the illusions and special effects. Free Wifi is provided. We had a lot of fun, it was a different experience seeing dinosaurs, sharks and artists coming out of the wall and interacting with its surrounding. It took us about 1-2 hours because we really enjoyed the special effects and made a lot of video and photo material."
37,5.0,Super fun museum to visit with friends and to take funny pictures. It's very interactive and there is also an app that adds VR effects. So download the app before you go.
38,5.0,"With the application they provide, you can get a lot of nice AR effects, illusions and also nice photos. With the AR technology, it's definitely worth the price to go in and have a look. But it will be more fun to go with a bunch of friends."
39,2.0,"Overpriced and pretty boring. There wasn’t much to do or see compared to the price. The ice museum was alright but the trickeye in itself was boring, old, and cheesy"
40,5.0,"Illusions, statues, VR, canvases - all you can find here. Better go with somebody if you want to make photos. I have never seen anything like this before. You need to download an app in order to have the complete experience. My phone was out of battery when I came here, but I could charge my phone directly in the museum, so at the end I could enjoy it :)."
41,5.0,This museum was super enjoyable. Me and my son really really enjoyed and liked it. This is a recommendable place. Really loved it♡ want to go again&again
42,5.0,"Went with my friend after dinner. The staff were friendly and explained everything to us before we start the tour. We downloaded the AR app and had so much fun seeing the eye-popping effects! Love the illustrations as well, colorful and meticulously drawn. It's definitely worth a visit!"
43,5.0,"We didn’t really plan to come here, but came here on our final night before leaving Seoul! It was only such great fun and made us feel like kids. We had a great time taking photos and checking out all of the effects for each one. We arrived at 7pm and left just as it was about to close at 9pm. We also had fun in the ice museum, especially going down the slide. The ice museum is really small, but you can’t stay in there for long anyway as it’s so cold!"
44,5.0,Venue is well done with both pictures and an app for your phone that adds moving graphics. It's a pretty good size and a good time. Best with friends that don't mind acting a bit foolish in pictures.
45,5.0,Download the Trickeye Mobile App to take 3D videos and pictures. We enjoyed taking pictures and videos. Be sure to bring extra clothes if you plan to enter the Ice Museum. It was so cold there.
46,5.0,The place is amazing. It's suitable for all ages and it's a super fun experience to enjoy with friends or family. You must bring a phone otherwise you'll be missing a lot since there's an app that you can download to make the experience even more fun. Very cool place! Totally recommended!
47,5.0,"This place can be visited by young people, children, or elderly people. The ticket price is not pricy compared to the view we can enjoy :D make sure to bring your phone or camera or you will regret! There is also ice room you can visit anyway!"
48,5.0,"This is my very first time coming to the 3D Museum and I was amazed with the QR code from the admission ticket which can be linked to Trickeye Apps. In that apps, I applied a lot of photo backgrounds in the museum and there are several effects coming from the screen when we put the camera in front of the selected photo background. 5 out of 5!"
49,5.0,I went with my friend last weekend and we had so much fun! It was so interesting to pose in various ways and we had lots of laughs. My favourite display was the one in which you could be a ballerina on stage!
50,5.0,I came in the fall of 2015 with my mom.  We both had fun taking photos and definitely recommend this place.  Of course it's best to come with at least 2 people for the purpose of taking photos.  I think it's fun for both kids and adults.
51,3.0,"went with some friends. honestly its cool for the first few minutes but at the end of the day all it is is lining up, taking pictures then moving onto the next exhibition. honestly its overrated an . kinda pricey for what it isl,..."
52,5.0,The museum is located in hongik university station which is a hot spot for tourists. The museum provides lots of interesting painting for us to take photos. We spend a nice day in the museum!
53,3.0,"I visited Trick eye museum, in the heart of  Hongdae (artistic and youthful district) for a day tour. It is a 3D Painting gallery of optical illusion and  augmented reality.  The paintings are regular and the 3D corners are average. I really enjoyed the Mirror Maze on the way out. You will be lost and dizzy trying to exit the maze because your reflection in the mirror is haunting you, making you believe that you have found the way out. You might be terrified in a fun way. SEE photos."
54,4.0,"Fun place to when it is cold for an hour. Except the Ice Museum its cold, be careful not slip like i did. Very busy  come early."
55,5.0,"Trickeye Museum and Love Museum在同一棟,所以很適合在Trickeye逛完後再到Love Museum遊玩,Trickeye 裡面有很多場景看到時覺得應該沒有很真,但其實拍完照片後覺得很像身境在擺設的場景裡,在照片裡的效果呈現出來特別好."
56,5.0,"Don't skip this place while in Seoul! We had really nice time taking hilarious pictures. Everybody who visit this place can't stop laughing, so funny it is. Download Trickeye Museum App, it adds animations to the picture."
57,5.0,We visited the museum because of the hype of other friends going AND IT WAS COMPLETELY WORTH IT! The photos you will get are super funny and laughing will be ensured. Absolutely recommendable.
58,5.0,"Very interactive and interesting museum. You will be surprised by what the museum app does. Great to visit with frinds, family or as a couple; it a good brake from traditional sightseing and gives a glipms of korean society likes; also is located in a  fun and young neighbourhood, so i would definitly recomed vsisting."
59,4.0,The tickets here was included in the Discover Seoul Pass. We had entrance to the ice display as well as the museum.The ice museum was in a giant freezer and had carvings of different things like a throne or a bear. They also had a huge slide which was quite fun to slide down.The Trick Eye museum itself was really interesting. It is way more enjoyable with other people as it probably wouldn't make sense if you're alone. One person stands at the photo spot and other people just do what they want and the outcome is generally a hilarious photo. Some were a lot easier to understand than others but there were plenty of photo ops.It wasn't too busy when we were there but I can see how it can get really busy as people try to get the perfect photo.They also had a virtual reality area where you can play some VR games but it is extra to the museum tickets.Quite an enjoyable experience but I think it depends on who you go with.
60,5.0,"Some friends and I spent about 2 hours taking photos and laughing like crazy as we toured this super fun ""museum."" I've never seen anything like it! If you enjoy puzzles, mazes, or optical illusions, you will adore this museum! Make sure to stow your stuff in the lockers before entering the museum - you are going to want your hands free! This would be a fun place to take a date, too."
61,5.0,It was great to Experience a New thing in my life and i enjoyed a lot There And I don’t wanna come back But my friends pulled me to go back I go very deeply And enjoying....The AR Experience Hope to visit again With my Family and Friends....yippeeee
62,5.0,came here with a couple of friends and had an amazing time at the museum! You can take many great pictures and videos in the different rooms and the ice museum is also included in the price. I'd definitely recommend visiting!!
63,5.0,"Came here with friends on a gloomy afternoon and had a lot of fun going through the exhibition!! All the rooms are differently themed and you can take some great AR pictures/ videos. The Ice Museum is also included in the ticket price.. really beautiful, just remember to put on a jacket before going in :) Perfect for a rainy day or when you just wanna have a chill time with friends or a partner!"
64,5.0,"I went with a couple of  friends and it was really amazing! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a great time and great laughs! Plus, the ticket gives you access to the Ice Museum, which adds to the fun! :-)"
65,5.0,Awesome museum experience with very friendly staff! Also the ice museum is in the ticket price included!! Definitely a must visit!
66,5.0,"I liked the museum especially the application. Augmented reality is high technology which is used in here to entertain customers like myself;) was a feeling of sort of futuristic entertainment !For sure you do not want to go alone since selfies will not work well in here.VR space and Love Museum are good bonuses, we had fun as a package ."
67,2.0,"I'm so glad that many people seem to have had a positive experience at this place.  Then again, I'm noticing that many of them are mentioning great Instagram photo ops and I'm not much of a proponent.The attraction is a self-guided walk-through of about 10-15 rooms of loosely-related murals painted on the walls and the ground that cause optical illusions with you the main subject when photographed from the right angles.When my friend and I visited it was very crowded with people falling over each other as they tried to take shots of their friends/family in the various corners of the rooms and kept backing into one another.  It was quite humorous to watch actually.I think this is a great attraction for families with young kids or Instagrammers that want a fun shot.  If one of these two categories doesn't really apply to you, you're not missing out on much and you'll have 15,000 Won more in your pocket."
68,5.0,"This museum is definitely one of a kind! I had so much fun with my friend here, and furthermore with the aid of the app, it just made the experiences a whole lot better! I've always wanted to go to a trickeye museum, and i glad that i finally decided to just go for it! Definitely a must place to visit before leaving Seoul."
69,5.0,i loved this place. Its so fun. Went with 1 friend but i wish we were more. Dont forget to take aomething warm because the ice museum is cold.
70,5.0,I didnt know that museum can be so interesting and funny! Moreover this museum has its own app which makes you believe in 3d reality through the special app camera. 🤗🤗 100% of enjoymen))
71,5.0,"The Trickeye Museum is in the heart of Seoul City, Hongdae. Get ready to be thrilled with all the paintings and images that pop up from the AR. What is unique about the Trickeye Museum? The AR effects. It offers free wifi to enable you to download the app and use the AR effects as you explore all the awesome sections.It is best to visit with friends. Aside from that, take a quick tour of the Ice Museum and the Love Museum as well. It is extremely cold in the Ice museum, but worth the visit. Best to visit on a weekend that you seek to have fun."
72,5.0,"Had a good laugh with my friend! When you download the free app, the paintings come alive, which makes the experiences even more fun. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy taking silly photos and have a spare hour."
73,5.0,I went with a friend and had a blast! the illusions are a mix of AR and 3D which makes it really interesting and fun to make short videos of yourself. I also visited the ice museum which was a mix of cute ice sculptures and my fav an ice slide. If you like making a fool of yourself and taking pictures this is def the place to check out.
74,5.0,I had a lot of fun! The illusions are amazing and there are a lot of spots to take awesome pictures. I really liked an app that makes pictures “move” and you can make videos with effects. This place is definitely worth visiting!
75,5.0,I really loved to go there with my friends. I had lot of fun and is a place where i will definitely want to go with my boyfriend also. I love the AR thing and i took funny pictures.
76,4.0,"Even though the museum is quite pricey, it’s still fun for a cold or rainy day. You can take tons of (admittedly cheesy) photos and their app is quite cool."
77,5.0,"I visited the museum with my friend recently and it was really fun. It's really innovative and they even provide a special smartphone app for camera so you can take even more interesting photos, with a lot of animations for the main part of the museum, Trickeye museum. The ice and Love museum are also interesting and creative."
78,5.0,"I have visited the museum with my friends I'm so happy I finally decided to do it! All 3 parts of the museum are so fun and interesting. I loved how every picture had instructions with how is the best way to take photos and I don't regret I went through the cold from Ice Museum. My favorite one is the Love one, we had so much fun and really made our day. I am glad we went and had so much fun since soon enough the exams period begins!"
79,5.0,"Have seen pictures taken here a million times on instagram, always wanted to visit, and it was totally worth it! Really liked the app, too, got some crazy pictures! Memorable and lots of fun, you gotta use your creativity to get the best possible pics, really liked all the options."

83,5.0,"I've recently visited this museum as part of my bucket list for places to see before I leave Korea.It was a lot of fun and overall a great experience. There was also a helper who would kindly take pictures of me and my friend whenever we needed one. And there are A LOT of spots to take awesome pictures! Definetly a place to watch out for if you're looking for a fun day out. I have visited the main museum and the Ice Museum, which features a room made entirely of ice!"
84,5.0,"I loved it! Before you go, make sure to download the app and take an extra battery because you will be using your phone a lot! The more friends you take, the more fun it gets! We spent about 2 hours there between the Trickeye, Love and Ice museum so make sure to have enough time and I recommend going during the weekdays when there's less people so you can take good videos!"
85,5.0,I was so surprised how amazing is Trick Eye Museum with the application! I had a great time taking videos with effects. Definitely worth to go there! A museum is bigger than I expected so I take plenty of pictures! My friends love them hahaha
86,5.0,"Really fun activity basically for everyone! I've been there 3 times and it only gets better. Now, when we can use the trickeye app, it makes the whole experience really unforgettable. I highly recommend it!"

90,5.0,"The Place consists of three separate museums, 1) Trickeye museum 2) Ice museum and 3) Love museum. All of them are good but The Ice Museum is a must visit place, especially if you have Children."
91,5.0,"I've been always wanted to visit this museum because I saw many nice and interesting photos of my friends before. And finally last weekend I had a chance to go with my friends.I would recommend this museum to someone who1. Likes to experience new things: There are 3 sections that I went through including Ice museum, Trickeye museum and Horror. You would appreciate the nice and arty walls, lovely atmosphere. Seems like immerse yourself into another world2. Interested in art and creative : all of the designs in this museum is in 3D so you can appreciate such nice pictures and models which you can actually be in. Tips: remember to wear something without hat or neck cover, dress comfy so you can fit in.3. Love taking photos: yes you're gonna have a whole album after getting out lol4. Find somewhere to spend the weekend with friends or partner: This is a pretty cool place to hang out. You would have good memories and photos here.The ice museum didn't very impress me because I've been to bigger ones in my home country. But I love the horror section ^^ Scared me a little bitI love the mermaid one because it just matches my jacket color haha. Will recommend it to my friends who visit Korea in the future"
92,5.0,"Looking for someplace to go when it’s raining looking to just have fun . You should check them out . The location is a but out of range you stopped to ask questions a few times but when you get there it’ll be fun . It’s actually a make of 3 sections , the love museum which is explicitly for adults based on the content , the trick eye then the ice museum . But you choose which you wanna do first that’s totally up to you . However the ice museum during the winter you will just wanna pop in take a few pics and get out as it can be quite cold but very creative . Overall experience great tons of fun and surprises that’ll have you laughing ."
93,4.0,I already went twice. First time wasn't enough to see and take pictures of everything cuz we got tired (kind of a big place) but it's so fun that we went back. It's good to go with friends and even families with kids. Loved it.
94,5.0,The Museum is located down a flight of stairs in a basement of a building in Seogyo Plaza. I found the Museum an enjoyable and fun visual experience. Would be good for a family outing as children can enjoy the interaction with the paintings to become part of the artworks. Toilets are clean and medium/large lockers are provided at a fee.It's a good and funny place to visit~ :)
95,4.0,"This place is fun no matter what age you are. Family, friends and couples can have fun taking photos at different stations. App download is ness. to make some of these images come to life but both photographer and ""model"" can have a blast bringing these art pieces to life. Go online to see if you can get a discount. There are 3 different museum areas to check out AND a big ""kid"" arcade. The love museum is for a MATURE audience only not for little kids."
96,4.0,Love that their museum is now equipped with an app that makes your pictures go live!  Worth a visit when in Hongdae
97,4.0,"What will they think of next??!!!  The app is a bit hard at first but all in all, it was pretty neat to check out."
98,4.0,"The Admission: 15,000 won (about $15)The Subway: Line 2, Hongik Univ. Station, exit 9So much fun!! Artistic techique that fools our eye into seeing three-dimensional objects from flat surfaces.Definitely fully charged your phone because you will definitelly want to take pictures at every setting!!It is kids friendly place,  absolutely a great family outing spot."
99,5.0,it was so much fun being here took so many photos and they have an app you can use to take live 3d videos. they also have an ice museum. Lockers are available to store your belongings definitely a must do.
100,5.0,The place is really interesting for people that a little bored by the normal. The painting are 3D based and make a diffrent world. What should you do when you are in another world? Takes some pictures of coursr :) all kind of pictures can be taken and every painting or figure can make some enjoyment. I recommend  going their with some friend for increased enjoyment
101,5.0,"Even we are no kids anymore, we had fun there. It's a bit pricey, but it is a really nice and funny thing to do, we took lots of pictures that make me still laugh. The price also includes the ice museum which is tiny, but fantastic when you go there in summer - it was the only time I didn't sweat like crazy ;-)"
102,4.0,"It was our first time to the Trick Eye Museum.  It's a fun place to visit, especially if you like to take photos.  The ticket included the Ice Museum next door."
103,3.0,"Visited here and took us a long time to locate the place and the people around d area dnt know much about this place.  Though we were able to take some tricky photos here (the only thing u can do for the money that u spend), it felt awkward posing since some people watching and waiting for their turn to pose."
104,5.0,This is a great thing to do with friends regardless of the weather. We had fun going through the museum taking crazy pictures.
105,4.0,"If you are in Hongdae, Don't miss Trick Eye Museum. This Museum will trick your eyes. Haha. I had fun!"
106,5.0,Have been to trickeye few times. They surprise me every time i go there. They always change new theme and introduce cool stuff. I like taking pictures so i would recommend people who likes photo taking and posing funny pose to go there.
107,4.0,Went there after the Nanta show as the entrance ticket is included in the package. We weren't interested at first but since its included we just decided to give it a try . Glad that we visited as we had great fun doing silly things .
108,3.0,"First: We payed 18.000₩!!!There are funny scenes, but it looks pretty run down, so that's a bit disappointing. It's not really worth the money, but we made the best out of it and it wasn't that bad. For the best experience you need the trickeye app (they have free WiFi access, so you can download it there, it's not that bad) Ice museum visit is included in the ticket price, but it's pretty cold!"
109,5.0,"The entrance is on a busy street, and is easy to miss if you aren't careful. Takes about an hour and the love museum is right upstairs. Great time especially since it was raining. It was a little crowded, but that was only because we went on a holiday."
110,5.0,"I had never been to a trickeye museum before and I loved it. It is something out of the ordinary and if you never have been before, you definitely should take the trip."
111,5.0,"I love this place and have visited on several occasions taking friends along with me. A fun day, with many different pictures to put yourself into. love it"
112,4.0,Really fun day with friends to take pictures and update your Facebook profile pic. Bring a full battery on your phone/camera and a little bit of patience because you'll probably have to wait to jump in on the exhibits but it its totally worth it!
113,5.0,Its a must have experience when visiting Korea. It is available for all ages and anyone can have fun. Just make sure you charge your camera before you go. A minimum of 2 hours of fun awaits you and for adults there's also another 30mins of fun.
114,5.0,The museum is really small but the paint is really impressive! You can easy spend 2 hours inside taking really convincing photographs!
115,3.0,I can have funny photo in this place and also get the idea how to take amazing photo.There are also have Love museum but have to buy another ticket.
116,5.0,It's better to go here with your friends to have fun taking pictures of each other. You can't help but act on each display. We got tired since we tried most of the displays here. Now I'm reminiscing and it leaves a smile on my face.
117,3.0,Haven't visited a trick eye museum before and found it pretty fun! We went quite late in the evening on a rainy day and the place was empty - literally no one but us and the staff were wondering around! Spent a couple hours going through taking photos. A cool experience!Tip: buy tickets in advance for cheaper!
118,5.0,A friend from Seoul took my husband and I here for a great couple hours of entertainment. We have some awesome photos and loved all the displays. We came at the right time and it was not crowded at all. Would be great fun with children too!
119,4.0,My friends and I had a few good laughs posing at / with various displays. The museum set up is inviting and colorful.  They give you lots of ideas how to best take advantage of the optic illusions.  Admission fee is nominal and we spent a couple of hours.  Of course the laughter scare extended when we shared our pictures afterwards.
120,5.0,"I visited this museum with my friends and we had a blast going thru the whole musuem.  It also comes with an ICE MUSUEM, and LOVE MUSUEM.  It one of my facorite places during my recent visit in Korea.  Its a must visit place."
121,3.0,"This museum is a good, fun way to spend an hour or so. There are plenty of opportunities for some fun photos as well as a games area and a whole section made of ice which is also nice to see."
122,5.0,It was a wacky day at the Trickeye Museum where nine friends of mine and I spent about an hour or so doing all kinds of poses to come up with some spectacularly fun and funny photos. Visit the Ice Museum as well as the Love Museum too. Be aware that the temperature at the Ice Museum is minus 2 degrees Celsius. The Love Museum is NOT appropriate for children.
123,5.0,"We had a Seoul pass and decided to go see what the trick eye museum is about. it is a definite MUST for all ages and all people. I would recommend going early in the morning when it opens (9am) to avoid crowds and also NOT to go alone. Ideally 3 people but two work fine. Also there is an ice museum we didn't anticipate so had to run in and out quickly due to the cold, would have been nice if we wore long pants at least or if we had some warm clothes. All and all, favourite museum!  Great pictures ;)"
124,5.0,My friends and me went to Trickeye museum since Sep 2015. I got some discount for fee entrance. That's so funny and good experiences! Have a many 3D pictures for take a photos. Moreover there're have ice town too. I will recommence to another people for visit this museum.
125,3.0,"I thought this was a museum for optical illusion, but it ends up being more photography orientated. Unless you like to take photos, I do not advise you to go."
126,3.0,"3.5 starsI like the idea of interacting with the murals. It's a cool place to go be silly and take pictures with your friends/family for a couple of hours. If you go alone, you can ask people to take pictures for you. We also got access to the Ice Museum part but I only lasted a minute because it was freezing cold and I only had on a t-shirt and capris. There's also a games/arcade section. You can also check out the Love Museum next door."
127,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this museum! Initially, the idea of taking pictures with optical illusions didn't seem huge, but when you're actually there, you'll realize how amazing these paintings are.Figuring out how to pose as well as taking the picture from the best angle is super fun, and I really recommend you go here with goofy friends and family.With our package(?) ticket, we also had access to the carnival area and the Ice Museum. The Ice Museum is super cool, literally.Such an interactive, fun museum experience!"
128,4.0,"This was a fun, and cool way to spend a hot afternoon in Seoul.  We took lots of pictures that we enjoy looking at now that we're back home.  The price includes entrance to the Ice Museum too!"
129,5.0,"The Trickeye Museum is an art gallery, the 2D paintings are painted by special techniques which make illusion of being in 3D. Depend on each of viewer, who may interact with the paintings in many different way. The activities were very fun and the picture look as real and emotion fully."
130,5.0,"Very unique. Never had so much fun like that before  in a museum. Kids would definitely love it. Both, adults and kids will have a good time."
131,5.0,"Not that informative, but a lot of fun for not that much money. You get to do the Ice Museum and the Trickeye Museum - great for all ages!"
132,5.0,"Perfect if you need a place to cool off in the summer, warm up in the winter or get out of the rain during Monsoon season!  Bring your camera and take photos at all the exhibits!  If it gets busy, you might have to wait in line for photos so be patient.  It only took us about two hours to get through and we took photos at almost every spot!  Great place for kids and adults!!"
133,3.0,"If you have nothing to do after a long trip, then Trickeye Museum could be good to be added to your Things To Do only if you love taking photos of yourself or your friends. It's a bit pricey. Otherwise, hanging around the area (Hongdae) is good enough."
134,5.0,"To me, this museum was brilliant because I had never done anything like it before. Placing yourself in situations make images come alive and give the impression that you're actually within them. It's an interesting concept. Not something to cancel all your plans for, but if you pass one and happen to have nothing to do or a few hours to kill, go have a laugh, you won't regret it."
135,4.0,Entrance looks cool. Lots to see. Lots of discounts on the wall before entering so be sure to check it out before paying
136,5.0,Excellent place to visit and create you own posture with each of trick.  Full of fun and happiness all the way.. don't miss it.
137,5.0,"there are 2 museums there , Trickeye Museum and small ice Museum. you can buy ticket for both Museums. The eyetrick Museum is fun and take up to 2 hours most and the ice Museum is really small and take 10~20 minutes"
138,5.0,"We had the best time on a recent visit to Trickeye!  My hubby and I went with another couple and we spent hours wandering around trying to get the perfect pictures.  There are lots of different scenes that you pose in front of, behind, on top of.... And the ""trick"" comes in when we download or print your pictures.  It  will appear as if you are hanging off a cliff, jumping from a building with a parachute, putting your head in an animals mouth....  So much FUN!!!!"
139,5.0,Lol. Lotsa 3D stuff and painting where you could actually be in it! Great for memorable moments and good for photography.
140,5.0,"It was an awesome experience for me. I got to visit this place after a hectic week at work. I could unwind myself in few minutes after entering the museum. The greatest part is you can make a fool out of yourself and pose for photos and enjoy yourself without feeling self-conscious about it as that is what everyone around you will be doing.Those were moments to cherish and I'll definitely remember this experience all my lifeDon't miss to fight David with colours. Its great fun!! :)Also, bring warm clothes, especially cap and gloves with you if you want to enjoy the ice museum without letting your face and fingers go numb, as this part is maintained at very low temperatures."
141,5.0,Fun place to get some interesting photos! There is also a love museum on the second floor for adults.
142,5.0,"The trickeye museum is very funny to do with friends. You can take great pictures of you (flying, being giant, being eaten by a shark,...). Just next to the museum is the ice museum and the love museum. I would definitely advise this museum."
143,4.0,"This was definitely a cool place to visit. There are so many photo ops with quirky and fun subject matters, so don't forget your camera! We were with a large tour group, so it made stopping to take pictures at the ones you wanted to difficult at times because there were too many people waiting. I'd recommend going here on your own with a small group instead. Otherwise, it's a fun and entertaining time!"
144,4.0,It's super fun but only if you go with another person to take pictures for you. Fast to go through but the ticket includes this the ice museum and the carnival section.
145,5.0,"A fun place to go with friends. Make sure your camera is fully charged and has room for lots of photos because you'll be taking a lot. You pay for 2 museums in one: ice museum and the trick eye. The ice museum is really small and REALLY cold. We didn't want to spend much time in there because we already thought it was too cold outside and had stores our jackets in a locker we rented in the museum. There is a small ice slide which was fun. Then after the ice museum you can go through the trick eye museum and have fun! It's in the basement, but there's a love museum above which looked fun (adults only)."
146,4.0,"when a friend was visiting around halloween, I learned from their website that they were offering free admission to those who came in costumes -- definitely fun and a great way to spend a few hours (if you take pictures at every station like we did), but i'm not sure if I would have been as satisfied if I had paid full price to get in. recommended especially in the winter when it's freezing outside!"
147,5.0,Good places to make funny and good captures. Our Ticket including ice museum.You must come with friend or family to do the perfect angle-shoot. Solo travel maybe will little bit difficult and confusing.
148,5.0,"Entry costs around 15,000 won but you won't be disappointed (children under the age of 18 pay 12,000 won). I know of some travel websites occasionally give way promotions where you print the e-voucher, you are able to get about 10-15% off. Located in the lively and youthful vicinity of Hongdae, it's no surprise that this is one of the most talked about attractions in Korea. Tucked away below ground level at Seogyo Plaza in the university town of Hongdae (subway stop: Hongik University), this museum shares the same location with the Love Museum, the Ice Museum, and the Carnival. The ticket enables you to go for the Trickeye Museum, the Carnival (where additional charges apply if you play the games) and the Ice Museum. The Love Museum which is restricted to visitors over 18 only require separate charges. Within an hour and a half to two hours, you can take picture with murals, statues and wallscapes which come alive through the lenses of your cameras. You can become part of the artwork once you are captured in the photo. Always have your cameras on standby so you are able to see how they look on your screen before taking the photos to get a more accurate look at how the picture will turn out. There are some photos on the wall to help you get some idea on how to pose for your pictures so that they'll look more realistic in 3D. Go on, pose and act the part! This is quickly becoming a not-to-be-missed attraction when visiting Seoul. Highly recommended."
149,4.0,"Yes, its really fantastic the way they art it and placed the things. Those makes you feel you did things in real if we look from camera."
150,4.0,"Be sure to get your camera ready! It's fun if you come along with your friends/family and do all sorts of weird and silly poses. The only thing is you have to queue and wait for other people to take their photos, meanwhile you can roam around freely. As for foreigners, remember to check out the visitkorea website and print out discount vouchers (if there are any)!"
151,3.0,Its quiet funny to go there with friends and to take some funny pictures. But we went there when it was quiet full and this is just annoying to wait hours until u can make ur own trick eye effect pictures.
152,4.0,"Visited this museum again for the third time with different group of friends each time. This time round they have new and different designs (for trick eye museum and ice museum). It is so sweet and cute. Managed to pose with some of the new designs. As usual, there were a lot of foreigners at the museum. So we have to be patient and wait for our turn to pose and take pictures. When you purchase the tickets, there is a discount ticket (printed at the back of the ticket) for singapore trick eye museum (as well other trick eye museums from other countries - but I don't remember which countries). You can keep the ticket and use it in singapore if you want to visit the one there in the future."
153,5.0,This was one of my dreams to see in soul. The art scene is so hard to find or originate the pieces because they always steal everything but this place is original
154,4.0,"Nice gallery but few of must sees are no longer available. However, the place is well maintained and still tons of fun, specially if you are traveling with friends. Check out some discount coupons from the Korean Tourism website."
155,5.0,"This museum has an amazing ideas for someone to take some great photos! It was a little annoying pushing through the crowd of people to get out of the subway,but once you cross the street its all clear. You get 3 attractions for 1 price. Then if you don't have the kids with you, make sure you check out the Love Museum. A must see!"
156,4.0,"It was fun. Spent a few hours, 1 floor, many rooms to see. Lots of interactive exhibits. Good for families or bored airman....15000 won ( $12)  pretty good price. Once was enough to visit, but for families good to go back."
157,5.0,"The Trickeye Museum is pretty cool. If you are in the Hongdae area, I would definitely recommend a quick visit to the Trickeye museum. This place allows for everyone to get creative and have some fun!"
158,5.0,"As soon as Got in the museum, you can see loads of people with big smile and laughter on their faces, definitely recommend to people who are seeking for good time!!"
159,5.0,Amazing art and so fun. Best stop in Korea for some unwinding. Bring a camera and prepare for some laughs!!!
160,5.0,If you are in the seoul area and want a quick laugh with friends or family... this is definitely a fun place to check out sober or not!!!
161,4.0,"The name says it all, definitely bring your camera as you will become a part of the ""trick eye"" artwork. Very fun place to be, entry was 15000 won (ice museum included as well)"
162,5.0,"You should come here to break up the stress brought on by shopping, shopping, shopping which is what most tourist end up doing in Seoul.  This is a fun escape that gets everyone, no matter what age, into the act.  You can just take photos of recommended poses by the museum at each station or use you imagination to create new ones.  Everyone is smiling and laughing inside this museum and I'm sure you would end up doing the same.  Highly recommended...."
163,5.0,"We found this activity hugely entertaining. For a $15 fee you walk around and take unusual and funny pics of your friends. This is not an activity for a lonely traveler. The streets around are lively with the students, shops and restaurants."
164,3.0,"When we reached, saw a banner stated that this is one of the most recommended attractions in trip advisor (if I am not mistaken). However, I am quite disappointed cause there is not much pictures. Not sure why. Maybe we took short way. And there were so many people at that time. I rather spend the money to go to other places."
165,5.0,"I have not be to a trickeye museum before and we loved it. Really fun and there is a small ice museum at the location, included in the ticket, which is worth a visit. There are different rooms so if one is not quite up your thing another will be. It is a little hard to find but most hostels and hotels have promotional leaflets with a very clear map on. The outside is clearly marked."
166,5.0,Super awesome museum. We weren't sure what it was when we got the ticket for Seoul Tower. We didn't really get it until we realized you take photos. We saw the camera signs and realized what to do and then we had a blast.  They should have staff provide some sort of explanation in English.
167,5.0,"The 3D museum is in an out of the way, hard to find area but if it's your first time to the 3D museum, it may still be worth the trip. I had fun though."
168,4.0,I was dragged here by my friends who are crazy about taking photos. The experience was nice and you have to be a bit creative to be in the picture.
169,4.0,"This was a funny museum. Great for solo photos or with friends. Make sure you bring your selfie stick if you plan to visit alone. Included with the Trickeye museum ticket, they included a free admission into the ice museum which was pretty COOL (pun intended). Make sure you have at least a jacket on before you enter the ice museum otherwise you'll rushing to leave. They have an ice slide inside which was fun but make sure you use the butt pad before you slide down to avoid injuries."
170,3.0,"Time to get interactive at this museum. Silly, fun scenes to take photos with. Quite imaginative. Based at the artist village just outside the city. Nice spot."
171,5.0,Mind tricks! The museum made use of parallelax errors and tricks on the minds! It was a fun day posing and taking photos!
172,5.0,It's my second time to visit Trick Eye. I have been to Trick Eye's hong kong branch before. The museum is an ideal place for photos and creating memories with friends and family. Good Artwork quality!
173,5.0,Went with my friends when we visited Hongade. Really fun place. And the photos are just hilarious. Nice place to hang out with friends.
174,4.0,It's a fun and creative museum that is geared more towards teens and young adults. It's a great place to visit for anyone who wants to take amazing photos.The only downside is that the museum may be quite crowded.
175,5.0,I heard so much about this place before and i finally had a chance to visit last month! It was absolutely amazing :-) i had so much fun taking photos and enjoyed showing off these photos to my friends afterwards. Strongly recommend for those who are planning to go to hongdae/ seoul!
176,2.0,"I think I wasted my time being there. Some people say it is funny, but I found it creepy. Adult and such things should not be a part of museum I think"
177,4.0,"I had no plan to visit this museum before this trip but it turned out to be more interesting than I had expected. There were lots of trick-eye photos and hours easily passed. Would recommend this attraction to families with children and teens, a group of friends as well as couples.We also got free entry to the Ice Museum. The Ice Museum was just a tiny room with a few ice sculptures and a slide."
178,4.0,"The museum offered a trick of 3-D photography for any photography lovers. It is located inside a building, not in a stand-alone building. However the entry ticket was quite expensive compare to the 3-D photos that you would get"
179,5.0,"A very enjoyable experience, which i think suits for people of a wide age range. Theyve also got additional parts like the ice museum :)"
180,5.0,"Saw this place in a kdrama once, so I was excited when I found out we were in Hongdae with nothing to do on a hot, muggy day! I think it's a really unique idea to let guests participate in the art. I'm glad we went on a weekday, though...I can imagine the frustration of fighting for your turn to take a picture on crowded days. My friend and i had a lot of fun taking pictures with different poses. I would recommend this place if you like taking pictures and being goofy :)"
181,4.0,"I seriously recommend a whole afternoon outside at this museum with your friends or family, because the pictures and illustrations here in this museum are generally rather abstract and amusing, and to take pictures, you need to be with someone to do so. The museum is located right in the middle of the Hongdae area, so you can also shop, eat and walk around the Hongdae neighborhood after an afternoon in this museum."
182,5.0,It was an excellent experience with some outstanding arts.  I really enjoy all the tricky photos of this museum.  They constantly changing and updating new display and to make it more attracting.  It's also great for kids.
183,3.0,"Definitely a neat idea. Good for a rainy day. If you go with the right people this can be a lot of fun. My friends and I were not very creative posers, so we just hung around to see what others were doing. In the end we got some cool pics. A lot of the pictures centred on Korean humour themes (dongshim etc.), or were just plain weird. But there were plenty of pictures there, so we just skipped the ones we didn't like and moved on to something else."
184,4.0,"This museum was a lot of fun, however, we went when there was a big crowd and had to wait a while to take pictures.  Unfortunately, other tourist were not as ""orderly"" as we are and would jump in front of us or would stay forever taking pictures, very rude.  But, that aside the pictures we took are pretty cool.  We would definitively recommend this attraction.  There is also an ice ""museum"" and, although we liked the Trickeye better, it was also a good experience (glad we did it).  Inside the building there is also a place to sit and have lunch and do some shopping.  We did not try the food there, but we did enjoy shopping at Etude House:)"
185,5.0,3D painting was amaaaazing!!! Totally cool! We enjoyed taking pictures and we liked the outcome of our photo. It looked liked a real one! The fee was worth it. Must place to see when you go to Seoul!
186,4.0,"It was a good place to let loose and have fun, taking silly photos while enjoying the art. Definitely a must-visit."
187,5.0,"It's a place where even grownups can feel like a little kid again - carefree, awed and excited all at once, while doing silly poses and taking photos. Plus having good laugh while at it. There are suggestions on how to pose for each set, or one can think and come up with their own idea on a different pose entirely. Money well spent for the fun & photos for memories."
188,5.0,"Kind of a silly place which does exactly what it says on the tin.Lots of cleverly designed ""sets"" that you can pose in and look like you are floating, in a forest, huge, etc.Recommended highly for a bit of something different to do, especially on a rainy day!"
189,5.0,"For less than $15 admission, its a great place to check out with friends. Note to bring camera and tri-pod and go wild with your imagination. Its a neat little place to check out, situated in Hongdae university area, this museum was a lot of fun and brings optical illusions to life. With our admission we also got to check out the ice museum and that was fun to see ice cravings and slide down the ice slide. We didn't have enough time but would've loved to check out the love museum too. Highly recommended!"
190,5.0,"After our much needed break, we headed back towards Hongdae to grab a bite to eat and visit the Trick Eye Museum. You’ve probably seen photos of this on social media. It’s basically wall art that gives off a optical illusion making the art to appear 3D when you’re standing and looking at it from certain angles. The fee was a tad high to go into the actual exhibit, but we managed to have a lot of fun with the free exhibits located before the entrance. If you have some Wons to spare I would recommend this on your must-do list."
191,5.0,First time to an trickeye museum. Its an art that you can be part of. It also brings out the creativity in you to make the best and funniest out of the art illusion. There are lines on the floor to tell you where the camera guy should stand and which angle to shoot from. Super fun
192,5.0,It's worth to pay a visit! Take tons of photo with different pose and reaction. Wonderful experience! There's a sex museum in the same building different entrance. U will be amazed
193,4.0,"People get to pose in different poses for different pictures and designs. Use your creativity for the poses but do not take too long for each design because there are many others who are also queuing for the same design (especially when it gets very crowded inside the museum). The admission ticket costs 15,000 won which include the admission to the ice museum as well. The ice museum is filled with ice sculptures and a slide. Overall, it is a fun place to spend time with your friends."
194,5.0,This is a great way to spend an afternoon.  It is a museum of awesome and fun illusions you take pictures with.  Naturally- this is the perfect place to go and take a MILLION pictures!!  So make sure your camera or phone has plenty of juice!!!If you are not big into picture taking or being in photos- this is not the right place for you.Keep in mind this place can get super crowded.  So if you are claustrophobic  AVOID!!!
195,5.0,"Great place to go to if you have time in Seoul! Before you go, you should triple check that your battery for your phone, camera, video recorder, and all your electronics are fully charged and turn off everything on your phone that would possibly drain your battery more sooner than you think!! Other than that, have a great time exploring your creative side!!"
196,4.0,"was so bored in Korea and we went to this place. it was a lot of fun, many props & back drop was neat. enjoyed it! There are many people in the museum,"
197,4.0,"The trick eye museum in Seoul, South Korea was the highlight of my trip! I felt like a kid again. They really had good ideas to trick the eyes when you take a photo. And I also LOVED the ice museum they had inside. If you're visiting Seoul you must go to the trick eye museum. FUN FUN FUN!"
198,3.0,Good place for capturing photos on 3D view.Not worthy the price paid for.ICE museum is OK.I like all 3d pictures work taking photographs and visit.
199,5.0,"Really funny place. Camera is a must have item in this museum. Went with my friends, made awesome photos)"
200,4.0,Nice place to click pics.. and have fun.. 😁.Enjoyed with friends ...Can spend 2 hours of time frolicking around..
201,4.0,"Trick Eye Museum is designed to take photos that make it look as if you're inside the art. Some exhibits are reproductions of famous art and others are just fun things like being eaten by a sea monster or levitating. A great place and well worth the price of admission.The exhibits change periodically, so you can go back later and have an entirely new experience."
202,5.0,I loved the Trick Eye Museum! There were many fun photo opportunities and the entrance fee was reasonable. The area surrounding the museum is the best!!! I definitely want to go back to this attraction!
203,5.0,"I have heard about such 3D artworks or seen some street arts like this on facebook, but this was my first time face to face with 3D art and the experience was immensely enjoyable.As i remember, the entry was around 14000 won which is 14 USD for trick eye plus ice museum adjacent to it.Each and every art of theirs is unique and fun to click yourself,and i remember laughing anf enjoying with almost every picture that was displayed.Moreover this a cool place where lots of families come with their little ones and couple visit and enjoy the stupidity of childhood.Some of the best artworks were in the shark mouth and my personal favourite bicycle in clouds. Do go and enjoy and click a lot.. Extremely memorable trip"
204,3.0,"The staff was really helpful to give us tips to get better shots, but the display itself was not my tastes in taking fake pics in front of.  If you get a coupon, go.  Other than that, it's a 1/2 visit."

There's also a love museum upstairs but meh.. I went there with my mom lol. So I didn't enter.Planned to spend only 1,5 hours top in the end we spent 2 hours+ hahaha"
206,4.0,Went to the trick eye museum earlier this year. It was a little tricky to find but worth looking for. It was.not quite what I was expecting but was great fun. I would definitely recommend it. Make sure your camera is fully charged and that you travel with a companion. It is only a one access entry so make sure you use the lockers and the toilets before you go in. Have fun !
207,4.0,"It was very cool to see! Also the ice museum is included and it really beautiful! Obviously you can not go alone because you need someone to take your picture, if you can I recommend going in as big of a group as you can because of the pictures that need two people, then you'll always have someone to take it. Fun half day activity for all ages!"
208,5.0,most drawings were realistic and samples photos were provided to show examples of poses. There were indicated photo points to show the best angle and distance to take the photos.
209,4.0,"If you love taking photos and enjoy using your imagination, than you need to visit this quirky museum which allows you to stretch your imagination and take photos while getting to enjoy art all at the same time. The museum isn't that big, but there is an ice museum next door so a good 2-3 hours or more would suffice. The museum is located at the basement of a building which also happens to house the Love Museum (let your imagination go wild! haha). Before the entrance of the Trickeye Museum there is a souvenir shop, a bubble tea shop and an area to rest those tired feet.Anyways, thanks to a discount voucher from the Trickeye Museum website, we got to save 3,000 won and paid 12,000 won instead of the original price of 15,000 won. The admission ticket came with complimentary admission to the Ice Museum and a discount voucher off bubble tea. So don't forget to check the website before you head to the museum. It might have been a weekend and there were quite a few people, but it was not overcrowded - there was still ample of space (and time) to pose and take fun poses with the art pieces that caught our fancy. Once we were done with our posing, we made our way to the Ice Museum. It was not very big but it was an ice wonderland. With the temperature being less than 0 degrees, it was extremely cold but an amazing experience to see sculptures carved out of ice, even a mini kitchen and bedroom made out entirely out of ice!Please check out my blog more photos and the Trickeye museum experience."
210,5.0,This is definitely worth a trip! Go with a group because the photo ops are endless and you need extra hands. Also make sure you get pictures on your camera lest you don't get them from others.
211,5.0,"One of the most entertainjng place to visit in Seoul, South Korea. My friends and I were so obsessed with the tricky shots we took there. I had 2 shots taken with the Boss of Qodariyah Travel & Tours. First shot he was the giant and I the timid dwarf. When I became giant he challenged me to a bout. That was cute."
212,4.0,"Tucked in the heart of Hongdae, the Trickeye Museum is a fun place to visit with friends. There are a lot of people who go there cause it's a tourist spot but it's generally a fun place to take some funny photos. Just go early so there aren't much people. Tickets are about $15 per person, make sure you bring a camera or the entire visit will be useless."
213,5.0,"It was a great fun and an activity for a rainy day or something different. The only thing is that the place is a little small and at times you would be in someone's way in taking pictures, and they would be in your way when you want to take pictures.However, it was a great visit"
214,4.0,I visited in november 2014. just curious it but after i love this place.I took a photo with my two friends. my friends also love to watch every fantastic pic..we will come again. love it
215,4.0,"They had a new ice museum when I visited this place in June 2014. But for a third time going to this place, I think I am getting a bit bored with the same paintings and pictures. Oh well! Good for first timers going there. I believe you will definitely enjoy it. PS: this review comes from a person (that's me) who went this place three times already."
216,5.0,Absolutely one of the highlights of my trip to Korea.  We spent plenty of time posing in front of different pictures. Take the time to line up the camera properly and watch for reflections from your flash to get optimal photos.Kind of an odd location - within a multi-level shopping district - once we found it we thoroughly enjoyed our time.
217,3.0,"Get your cameras ready and prepare yourself for a photo shoot as you view and interact with the 2D paintings in this art gallery and visit the Ice Museum after. Using the subway, it's pretty much easily accessible: walk straight ahead from Honggik University Stn. Exit 9. turn right once you reach Friday's restaurant. Walk straight ahead and cross the street once you reach H&M shop. Lined on the on the streets of shops, Trick Eye Museum is in the basement of the building next to the restaurant. You can visit korea.com if the discount coupon is still available: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/HD/event/enu_20140114/trickeye_enu.jsp"
218,5.0,The picture is nice:) We took the tripod and take photos oursleves.The ice museum is also free when you have bought the Trickeye Museum's ticket.
219,5.0,"It was fun though, we enjoyed it and the price it reasonable and worth it.........................................."
220,5.0,"Trickeye museum has some amazing and extremely interesting paintings which made our tour an unexpectedly fun and often funny photo taking experience. We had expected to spend one hour at most but ended up half a day and if not for pressing needs to move on, we would have stayed longer.  Definitely worth a break from all the shopping in Seoul !"
221,3.0,"I enjoy these museums however, this one has some attractions too close together and will make for more photo editing later. Still great I really enjoyed the sea monster and had a great time."
222,4.0,"It was great taking fun photos with the murals/paintings. However, you do need to have patience to wait for your turn to take photos. :)"
223,4.0,"This was definitely one of the highlights of our short tour in Seoul. Lots of funny pictures to take. Unfortunately we went there on a Sunday and there were so many people, there were queues for almost every artwork. We were not able to take all the pictures we wanted because our time there was to short.Bring kids with you. They would definitely have a hilarious time.Didn't spend much time in the ice museum (free entrance of you have a trick eye museum ticket); 15 minutes there was enough."
224,4.0,as i go with my friend to this museum.  it was fun taking 3D photos and it got a fee to go in and you pay some money then u can do a doll painting over there.
225,4.0,"Not a fan of ""tourist traps."" but I really enjoyed it here. Went here on a Saturday and it was just a little crowded. All people, old and young really went all out silly, posing and taking pictures and just enjoying the artworks. It was an enjoyable experience.Groups who are traveling with family or friends will love it here and may have a memorable bonding experience. You might want to check out KTO's website for discount coupons for Trickeye Museum."
226,3.0,"Went there on a Thursday night and there were a few people in the place. We had fun posing and didn't bother if we look silly towards other visitors :) There were some 3Ds i found before which are not there anymore during my visit. I hope they'll still add more 3Ds and integrate ticket with the Love Museum, because we're interested to enter the place unfortunately there's a separate fee.We also tried the ice museum (-3 degrees ), we were in a hurry posing because of the extreme cold."
227,5.0,"Entrance fee was 15,000won. Can even go into Ice Museum. we took lots and lots of photos there. Can spent at least 2hours inside. There are lots and lots of interesting 3D for you to take pics. Will come again next round I come to Seoul. Recommended."
228,4.0,"The museum has eight thematic exhibits, including historical, twists of familiar masterpieces, romantic, luxurious, domestic, traditional, style, and finally, a house of mirrors. The museum also hosts various ongoing educational programs for children and is open conveniently until 9 p.m. every night, making it an ideal course for couples."
229,5.0,It is fun to take pictures with 3D effects.   It is not easy to find the entrance as it located in a small street.
230,5.0,I love the art displays here. Everything seems to be 3D. I also like the love museum that can be found just beside it.
231,5.0,"My friend from HK wanted to go to the Trickeye Museum. Although it sounded cheasy, I tagged along and it turned out to be more fun than I thought! We took a whole lot of photos and we still laugh at them. The tickets weren't too expensive since we got a combination discount ticket for Trickeye and the river cruise from funtastickorea.com."
232,5.0,"We had this as part of our last day itinerary because we don't want to go far from where we are stying. And this was a really good place to stay. All you need is a good camera, patience to pose, good angles and smiles! They have a lot of backdrops that you can use for the photo opt and they often change them I think so that tourists who visited and will visit them wouldnt have the exact set of pictures. Coupuns can be found in the internet for discounted entrance fees."
233,4.0,"I went with my best friend on a bad day. It was quite crowded and the fee to enter just to take pictures was a little expensive. We bought a locker to put our bags in but sadly it ate our money and didn't open, so most of our pictures include our bags. It was a fun experience! The pictures I took turned out great and will make amazing memories."
234,5.0,"The location to the museum is only obvious as you get closer to the Hongdae area. It is not located in a tall building but along a street so please keep a lookout for the small road signs which directs you to the museum. There is also the Ice Museum which is worth visiting, especially during summer time."
235,4.0,Like: there are 3 museums in same building: 1-romance 2-trickeye 3-ice world. also so many markets and shops around the museum with a very good prices. Nice coffee shops.Dislikes:The museam is underground and only a small sign is there and laide figer on top of the entrance.Not much parking space if you drive there.Very crowded area.
236,5.0,"Been there with my friend and absolutely adored it! It is nothing very cultural Korean, but great and fun time is 100% guaranteed! Get ready to kneel, climb, jump, twist, sit, lay down and do other fun stuff... Hence, my tips - get comfortable clothing, but universal, so you can fit into majority of sights. For girls, on some of the pictures, which you are supposed to turn upside-down later, it is better to make a bun with your hair, otherwise it looks not very natural. Be prepared to make funny faces and pose every 2 minutes.. The place is for sure to enjoy with your friends - there are many scenes requiring more than 1 person. The Ice Museum which went along was much less fun and a way too cold for this summer, but still a good addition for more fun time."
237,3.0,"Korea used to be the only place that has Trick Eye Museum, but recently it has opened one in Singapore, Sentosa. However, the displays and drawings are somewhat different from the rest with a few similarities. And they have a new Ice Museum (bundle package available)I visited the one in Seoul :)  Admission cost about 13,000 won per adult. They have really fun and interactive displays and drawings! You could jolly well be spending at least half a day there. Also lockers are provided at the entrance, really useful because I shopped a lot in Hongdae before heading to the museum, it sure helps to ease the weight.You can view the photos at http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/08/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-6-hongdae.html"
238,5.0,Very interactive art displays that are fun to take pictures with!  My friends and I spent awhile wandering around this place and posing. Not a far walk from the univeristy and park in Hongdae.
239,5.0,All of us (6 ladies) had so much fun time posing at the Trick Eye Museum ... we were there until closing time.
240,4.0,"My first time to this kind of gallery , amazing! the ice gallery is damn cold... so we just stay there for few seconds..."
241,4.0,If you love to take pics - it's a place for you!They do change the backrounds once in a while and some are really amazing!Go there with a friend so to take pix of each other. Prepare to have about 3 spare hours for this.
242,5.0,"The trickeye museum was a lot of fun and we throughly enjoyed it.We went on a Saturday morning and it was really full, so make sure to get there early or to schedule a few hours for the trip.Some of my friends didn't enjoy it as much as they thought it was stupid just posing with paintings but the rest of us had a blast.The ice museum is also fun and the Love Museum upstairs was also worth it."
243,3.0,"This is the type of place you appreciate going to more afterward than while you're actually there.  The day we went was so busy that it was nearly impossible to take a picture alone.  We waited about 5 minutes for each picture.  I'm sure it would suit many peoples' interests just fine, but I need something more to do than walking around taking pictures.  Also, if they have the ice museum going on, I do NOT recommend going on the ice slide!  They give you absolutely no indication at all on how to stop yourself, so when I reached the bottom, my feet slammed into the ice ledge really hard.  I had severe ankle pain for several days afterward.  That having been said, I seemed to have been the only one with this problem, so you can take your chances and hope you're not as uncoordinated as I am :)"
244,4.0,"I enjoyed this place like others comments but there are a few cons!First, so many tourists. I know we suppose to face with tourists but this is too much! too crowded to take pictures or even to walk! Second, Only 3 restrooms. Like is said, too crowded but only has 3 restroom."
245,4.0,"We arrived at the Trick Eye Museum after dinner, which was a shame because the one and a half hours that we had weren't enough for us to explore the whole place and we had to skip the exhibits that allowed us to dress up. The door was a bit hidden though and we missed it the first time we went through. For a place where photo taking was the main draw, it was awfully dark so for the amateur photographer (ie. me with a camera too advanced for my basic skills), some photos came out blurry, especially when we asked other people to take photos for us. I think out of my whole trip in Korea, I liked the photographs taken here the most because they were all so silly! However, I wouldn't really recommend this place for older visitors unless you're willing to do silly poses against backdrops. It would be a great place for couples or just friends wanting to make some memories."
246,4.0,"I went there with some girlfriends. I have to say this place is interesting. I say this because it like going to a photo shoot where you and your friends are the models and photographers. I will say its a tad expensive for what they offer. There are places everywhere to take pictures. Some are very strange and others that are funny on there own. I took so many photos, many of which are pure comedic joy.  This place was fun and if friends come to visit will we go back."
247,4.0,"Smacked in the middle of a small alley in Hongdae, the Trickeye Museum is located at Basement 2. It can be difficult to find the stairs that leads down to the museum, so just look out for the signboard that says that it is the stairs to Trickeye museum!Content wise, there are many galleries of different illusions to view. Spend some time admiring the different illusions/paintings and take photos as per instructed for each exhibit! You will definitely be astounded by how every single illusion works. Feeling tired from all the walking or hungry? Fret not! There is a café directly beside the ticketing counter. Take a seat and grab a small meal or snacks with drinks to fill up your stomach!"
248,3.0,"Great paintings and nice place to take photos.Its not in a convenient location and too crowed, it was packed with tourist on the day of travel."
249,4.0,My friend and I had fun posing with the pictures! It was really quite fun to laugh at other people and be laughed at! All the pictures had examples to show you how to pose.
250,5.0,"Very interesting place. Can spend a lot of time there for taking pictures. Worth visit. The museum is larger than I expect and there are many 3D illusion. Worth visit. But better avoid holidays and visit earlier. When there are lots of tourist, you have to q up for taking picture and hard to get the best angle for the picture."
251,4.0,"Loved the visual illusion. You get to act out different scenarios like interacting with a well-known painting, or just pose however you want to."
252,5.0,This 3D art museum  is just not for the youngsters. Adults who allow the child in them to surface  will have a roaring good time here. They will be energised with the fun and laughter. This place is basically for taking photographs so make sure you have  company so that you can take photographs for each other. At some points two or more people in the photograph would be fun. Follow the instructions in the leaflet given for  awesome and unique photographs. This is a fun museum ...
253,5.0,"This place is newly opened, so a little hard to find but once you get there it is worth the effort.  We had so much fun at the Ice museum first to cool down a lot!  We took so many photos that have come out perfectly, with many comments about how fantastic they are from family and friends.  A fun way to spend a few hours with many optical illusion photos to remember it by."
254,5.0,A lot thing can be see and take a photo as memory from this museum. Its quite good and creative. i very like their 3D action.
255,4.0,"I went to the one in Hong Dae, I guess it is smaller. If you want to visit the trick Eye Museum, make sure drag a friend with you, so that he/she can take your pictures. I did not enter the museum it self. Even the exhibition/installation on the outside was very amazing and we spent more that an hour. So be prepared to spend hours inside the museum."
256,4.0,FInd a great 3D pictures here!!!Cheese and action....Collect your picture as many as possible here. Love it.
257,4.0,it was a lot of fun to take pictures and hang with friends. it can be a bit crowded when its busy so difficult to take pics. a bit difficult to find.
258,4.0,"Included in most package itinery of a seoul tour, it's just a fun place with various illusions you can photograph yourself in. There is also a mini ice museum in the same building. Wish there were more items as you finish after less than an hour even after posing for dozens of pictures. It s a small place and can be pretty crowded. There is no lift and you walk two levels down"
259,5.0,"I spent 2 hours trying every spot of 3D pictures on photo shooting. Never have been so relax in enjoying any kind of posts that could make the photo outcome a laughter of joy. Highly recommended, after all, joy n happiness i had there always brought me fond memories not of the place but of my existence sharing with a different location and its culture."
260,4.0,Cool place to visit! We went on a Tuesday so it wasn't that crowded. We had most of the 'scenes' to ourselves. The discount voucher for up to 4 pax was helpful too. Glad to know they're opening in Resort's World Sentosa in Singapore soon!
261,4.0,"It was very cool. So many scenes for you to take photos but due to the large amount of people, it tends to be too small. hahaha. But it was very nice."
262,4.0,It was a rainy night and we decided to play tricks with our eyes. The arts are amazing. I kept taking silly pictures with the museum display and it look so real! The museum it's very clever and there are many good spots for taking photos. So don't forget to bring your camera!
263,4.0,"I had a fab time at the Trick Eye museum, it's a lot of fun! The negative points are that it is very VERY warm inside and gets rather crowded. The crowds mean that it can be difficult to get your photo taken at all the stations - and that you are constantly trying to avoid getting in the way of other people's photos!  I would strongly advise you to put everything you have with you, apart from your camera, into the lockers at the start - if you don't you end up either with it in all your pictures or leaving it in everyone's way."
264,5.0,"I went to the museum after seeing good pictures my friends had taken. I didn't expect it to be too good tbh, but it was awesome! I also expected it to be croweded but there were only a few people inside which was excellent! You can have a good laugh taking pictures here!They also had an Ice museum attached which we went to also. That was pretty cute too. However, the museum can be easily missed because the entrance is not like a regular museum.. It's kind of just a sign that points to some stairs leading underground so you gotta keep your eyes open for it!In the museum area, you can also paint your own clay dolls which is nice, I didnt do it but it looked fun."
265,4.0,"This place is not that obvious and you could easily missed it if you were fascinated by the shops around it. When i was about to pay for the tickets, 8,000 won each, the lady reminded me nicely that the tickets i'm going to buy is for the 'LOVE museum'. I had a second glance at the place and i don't think it is suitable for my under 18 cousin and our intention was to visit the trickeye museum anyway. So .. be careful with that. Trickeye museum is further down the stairs and cost 15,000 won for adult and 12,000 won for kids. Lockers are also provided at 500 won. Free admission to ICE musuem with that ticket too. However, do bring your jacket with you before entering the ICE museum!! it is freaking cold insde, around -4 degree celsius. Still a nice experience even though the ice museum is kinda small and nothing much to see.Overall, this is indeed a fun place for the adults as well as the kids."
266,4.0,"we had a nice time here and we were glad because we're the only customers inside! went there around 11am on a thursday so the place was like ours. we paid 15k won each initially but the guy gave us a discount and then another discount (i think they removed the tax, im not sure bec i didnt understand their accent) but it was a discount and thats all that matters. so i think we just paid around 10k won each. they have very interesting pictures almost real life and its really enjoyable. probably visit this place once when you go to seoul. the length of your stay depends on crowded the place is but if you have the place for yourself, you should be able to have your photo taken on every picture in an hour."
267,5.0,"This trickeye museum is pretty awesome and also has an ice museum that comes with the ticket. The ticket for entry is just around 15,000 won but is very worth it as i've never seen anything like it before. However, it is not the best to go alone as friends can take pictures and enjoy the place with you. There are several illusions which you can take photos of, but try to find a good time where it is not crowded. Enjoy it ~"
268,4.0,"A few of us went through and visited the museum. Pretty cool place to take pictures, have a fun time, and relax."
269,5.0,"Inexpensive and original.My boyfriend and my friend took a lot of photos there.Some of the staff can speak english, so there wasn't any problem to get in.Don't forget to visit the Ice museum, you can visit both with the same ticket!"
270,2.0,This attraction has been open less than two years and it is super run down!Went with friends on a Saturday and the place was PACKED.  You want to get some fun trick eye pictures but it is so crowded that you only get a few seconds to take a picture and the photographer is having a hard time because the photo shoot spot is inaccessible.  Also quite a few of the 'exhibits' are closed due to refurbishment or disrepair.   Would have skipped if we knew it was going to be a miserable experience.
271,3.0,"This place really depends on the fun you and your friends put into it. You can have a blast clowning around, but there's not much need to repeat the experience. In the end, I found it overpriced and crowded."
272,5.0,"I really liked it here. I think the usual admission is 15000won/ 1500yen/ $15. However, because I found this coupon online...it was only $12/ person. This $12 admission included the Trick Eye Museum and admission to the Ice Museum. It was worth every penny. I'm so glad my friend brought her heavy duty camera with her. We had so much funny just doing silly poses with all the crazy 3D art pieces..... We took so many awesome photos, that I have a hard time deciding which photos I want up as a profile picture on facebook.This place has free wifi. And the lockers are available for use with the cheap fee of only $0.50."
273,5.0,this is a very unique and fun museum where you can take pictures next to funny scenes. I really liked it ans made for lots of fun for the family. Everything is laid out well and the pictures are excellently done. The only problem is that the place is crowded! but everyone was very polite. I liked the ice museum as well. wow. good times.
274,5.0,trick eye is most funniest-coolest museum in Seoul !! You will make a perfect profile picture from there!
275,4.0,"It's a much bigger version of Seriland (at Manila Ocean Park).  Fun to take pictures but too many people around, we need to queue up."
276,5.0,"Fantastic please and you will love. You ll find some of the greatest fine arts and you will be part of it , greatest experience in Seoul!!"
277,4.0,"This museum is a nice place, although it is rather small. The entrance fee is a little expensive as well. Inside the museum there is a variety of optical illusions set up which are really good for photographs. Most of the illusions come in the form of pictures drawn on either the wall or the floor.  Some of the illusions involve physical objects however.When I went there was a table that had some mirrors arranged so that when looked at from the right angle, it appeared you had no body and your head was resting on the table. There was also a room you could stand in with a couple people where one person would appear much larger than the other person.Again, the museum is not that large so it can get somewhat crowded during peak times. Probably best to go early if you want to have the most time taking photos with the illusions. Overall, even though it was a little expensive, I certainly think it is a good place to go to spend an afternoon (or morning). Also great if you like taking photographs."
278,4.0,The fee is expensive but my friends and i have lots of fun and we took lots of pictures. I'm glad that the trip is worthwhile because i thought the museum will be just like any other boring museum but it turned to be the other way around. I just wish if they re-painted some of the art there or add a new one.
279,4.0,"It was hard to find this place even though we had the address a map. The museum is actually in the basement. Look for banners at the street level. I think the entrance fee was 15,000W per adult. At the street level you would not guess that there is a huge underground facility underneath!Basically there are many many 3D pictures painted on the walls and ground and if you would pose/act/react with the pictures at specific angles to achieve the desired effect. It’s a bit silly but you can kill 1-2 hours easily. Overall I had fun and took about 200 photos, but it’s the kind of place you only go once. I don’t recommend this for small children (more suitable for young couples/groups of friends)."
280,4.0,"Went here for around $15.  The museum was quite busy, everyone really trying to get their pictures in.  The pictures are really cool, so I say it was well worth it.  I just wish it wasn't so crowded."
281,5.0,"You may think ""what the hell is that?"" if you don't know the concept of it.I did it same way when I was first time.It's been real with those real-look drawings.One thing never forget if you decide to go there is ""CAMERA"".You can take real good surreal photos of you and your friends even with your family."
282,5.0,"Trick eye at Hongdae was a fun place to spend the afternoon indoors in the cold winter. The pictures taken from your camera turns out like 3D and it was really interesting. There are instructions to tell you how to pose for the best effect. When you want to have a picture with all your friends, there are staff around who can help to take the pictures. More often than not, the pictures taken by them turn out to be even better than the ones which you take on your own! haha"
283,5.0,My friends and I really enjoyed this place.  There are a ton of great picture opportunities throughout the exhibit.  I've been there several times and they are always adding new paintings.
284,4.0,"Loved my first visit in 2011 with my friend. Since we arrived quite late, the staff were kind enough to let us stay even until past the designated closing time. This place is cool to have first dates, hang out in groups and most of all, take really really cool photos. The one in Hongdae is easier to locate now. Tip: allot 2-3 hours to really enjoy the place. After all, the entrance fee is not cheap and you should take as much as possible from it. Enjoy, prepare your poses and take many photos!"
285,3.0,"It was really interesting and there were many artefacts there. Got a little tired trying to capture a photo so we ended up skipping some. A good place to spend some time with friends and children. Though i felt that the ice museum was a very small and quite boring, but it was included in the price for the trickeye museum."
286,5.0,"I found this via Tripadvisor and took 8 friends this morning. It wasn't too hard to find, although as others have pointed out it doesn't look like much of anything from the outside. Once you head down to the basement, however, it's a different story. So many people but really a great time for everyone - even those who were initially reserved about the whole idea. Basically, there are perhaps 100 or more optical illusion paintings and structures that you can pose in front of for clever and funny photographs. This would be great with small groups, couples, families, or children. It can take some time to get the photos just right, so bring a tripod or a camera you are very comfortable with. Also, you have to be pretty patient to wait for your turn. The ice museum was an added bonus and included in the price of the ticket. There are some ice rooms, an ice slide, and an ice car you can sit in. Good fun if you've never been to the ice hotel or similar structures elsewhere.If you don't mind being a bit silly and are looking for an unusual experience in Seoul, give the trickeye museum a shot. It's also in one of the most trendy and interesting neighbourhoods in town, which should work into many travel itineraries nicely."

The entrance at the ground floor of the building wasn't convincing, it looked like an old abandoned one. But once you went upstairs, you got that fun ambience of the place. We buy the ticket on the spot. You might browse the internet for somekind of voucher for discount on this attraction.Make sure the battery of your digital camera or camera phone is full. Because you'll be taking a lot of picture here. A LOT! Be creative with your pose. If you can't think of a creative one, there's an example picture on every 3D painting that helps you posing. The entrance ticket to Trickeye Museum also applicable to enter the Ice Museum in the same floor."

291,5.0,"""Trick Eye Museum.. WTH"" when the travel mates saw it on the itineary. Guess what, even grown up men could not resist posing and taking pictures in the museum when they stepped in, let alone ladies. Hence, the initial plan of two hours dragged to four. Must visit place for half a day of fun and laughter. Ooooh, remember to print out a voucher from their website which admits 4pax and gives a discount of 3,000 KWR each. Free entry to ice museum too. Well worth the time and money."
