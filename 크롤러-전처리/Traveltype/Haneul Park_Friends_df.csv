0,4.0,"If you do not wish to attempt 291 stairs or long hilly walk up to the top of the park, you can take the golf-cart shuttle service departing from the park entrance at a small charge (1 way 2,000 won / return 3,000 won)."
1,5.0,I come to Hanuel Park on autumn day. The weather is so cool and little hot at noon.The park is near by World Cup Stadium.It's so easy to go to there by subway.And you take electric car to the top or climb to there.You should go to pinky grass hill.
2,4.0,"It has fresh air and clear blue sky. I really enjoyed the moment there. You can go there by subway to World Cup Stadium Station and walk about 1 kilometres to Haneul Park. You can choose shuttle bus and pay about KRW 5,000 for round trip or just walk by the upstairs to the destination. It was good experience!!!"
3,4.0,"Instagram brought us here! The park is huge, from the size of it, probably 90% is filled with silvergrass and the rest is pink muhly grass and kochia. We arrived early in the morning and had to walk around 20 minutes from World Cup station to reach the foot of the hill. There are 3 options to reach the top, by tram, stairs or hill climb. We opted for stairs and get down by hill. There was silvergrass festival during my trip but it wasnt fully bloom yet. Pink muhly grass on the other hand was blooming perfectly but the land plot for pink muhly is too small hence huge crowd. Overall experience, we had great time here"
4,4.0,"It was quite a journey to get to the top but I bet the view was worth it on a perfect season. Unfortunately for us, the place was barren the time we went (March 2018 to be exact)"
5,4.0,"Oh, this was fun. Haneul Park was not on our itinerary, but since we were in the area, we decided to make a go for it and check out what was so special about it—why it was deemed one of the “most Instagram-worthy places in Seoul.” Going up, you can either hoof it or take a tram for a minimal amount. We decided to take a tram, and there was a medium-sized line, but manageable. Upon arriving at the top of the hill, we were pleasantly surprised to see the silvergrass (?) in autumn colors with some snow (this was in the mid-afternoon, almost December). It was indeed very pretty, and the sweeping view of the grass, the river and the city did explain why it’s very popular for people to go there and have their photographs taken. Never expected the grassland to be so pretty, and that the area used to be a landfill and now is a park is quite impressive too."
6,5.0,It is a park located near the world cup stadium. The best time to visit this place is during autumn when the silvergrass start to turn golden and silver from green. They also have kochia and pink mullberry grassYou can take the stairs to the park or take the 3000won shuttle. I recommend taking the stairs to enjoy the breathtaking view.
7,4.0,"Take the metro to World Cup Station and go out from Exit 1. Then walk across to Haneul Park. Takes about 5 minutes walk only. Pay for the entrance fee of 3000 Won and add a little extra to take the shuttle to the top but for those who enjoys the walk, by all means hike up the slope.Went in December2018 and enjoyed the place without all the crowd. Had all the time to take photos, etc. The views from Haneul Park is breathtaking. But once the wind blows, hope you have enough layering to protect you. :p They only had the toilets at the Café area opened. While the rest were all closed. Café wasn't open either."
8,5.0,"The park was quite big and well maintained.  It was accessible by subway; close to World Cup Stadium Station.  After a 10 mins walk from subway station, there are over a few hundreds steps to climb to the peak of the park.  There is also a shuttle to take visitors to the peak at a small fee. The garden was especially beautiful in autumn, with different types of plants of distinct colours, such as Eulalia grass, pink muhly grass etc.  Highly recommend to visit in the morning if you want to take nice pictures."
9,5.0,A climb for an hour just to see its amazing view. Haneul Park is a park for the family and friends. Gives us the vibes of a park and mountain at the same time. :)
10,4.0,"We went there on a Monday afternoon, the park is packed with people. We paid to take the electric golf cart to the hill. Should spend more time to walk around but we didnt get enough time."
11,4.0,"The park is very popular among local for its silver grass festival. We went there on Monday morning and was thinking there would not be much people however we're wrong. There were many people already waiting for shuttle bus to go up to the hill. At the end we had waited for more than 30 minutes. It only took 5 minutes taking the shuttle and a round ticket is not expensive. You could also choose to climb few hundred steps instead.The view on the peak is stunning, you could take a lot beautiful photos with the endless silver grass field. Also,  if the weather is good you can also have a very nice panoramic view of the city. Beware there is nothing else on the hill, if you are not interesting in taking photos you probably will get bored very soon."
12,4.0,"As its spelled out in the packaging, Haneul means Sky. The park/garden is located on a hill that was used as dumpster back in 1990s, the government rehabilitate it to become a park near the World Cup 2002 because the location is very near to World Cup Stadium in Jamsil. The trek above can be quiet a feat, but they also offer a buggy service for you with extra charge. You can choose to hike up and down (they also have wooden staircase if you prefer), or riding the buggy to save your knees' joints. I myself rode the buggy going up and took the stairs down (slowly, because it was quite tiring). The view on top is marvelous, in early October, the grasses are turning silver, they go about 2 meters high, great photo ops, in between the grasses. They also have some Red Kochia and also a bit of Pink Muhly grass, great place to take picture. You can enjoy the view of Seoul from top of the hill, and relax a bit before going down. Overall, it's a good destination, you can visit this park in the morning before going around your other destinations."
13,4.0,"A long walk up the 200+ steps but great views. Did you know that this used to be the Nanji-do garbage dump for west Seoul? On a hot day, you can still smell it faintly. The methane gas is captured and used to produce the electricity for the nearby World Cup Stadium park.Great food trucks in the neighborhood in the evenings too."
14,5.0,its very nice though its so tired to get there because its almost 200+ steps like when you climb on a mountain :) but its beautiful there you will see the seoul world cup stadium on the ground...the view there is so beautiful and amazing.
15,4.0,Me and friend were in Haneul Park to take pictures of the autumn leaves and flowers. We bought some food to picnic.
16,4.0,"Nice place to take picture, the air and ambiance is just perfect. We visit in some cloudy evening but the scenery is still great."
17,4.0,"I visited Haneul Park with friends and we're lucky enough to visit during the Silver Grass Festival. Definitely worth the hike! I whole park is beautiful, every corners are picture perfect :-)"
18,4.0,"I visited Haneul park on Korea  Chuseok day.  Haneul means sky in Korean, so it can be called as Sky Park too. It is a big and beautiful park, and surround by Noeul park and Hangang park as well. I wanted to visit Haneul Park since long time ago because it is a very nice place to take photo. I purposely visited on Chuseok day, as i expected there would be not much of people visiting on this day. But when I reach the destination, I was surprised because there were so many people. A lot of people bring their pets along and many families are enjoying their time. The way to reach the park, you have climb a zigzag stairway which called sky stairs. It consists 291 stairs! If you do not want to climb the stairs you may take a ride too! I  went up by myself and it took some time and energy because of the crowd. When I reach the park, it was really nice and flowers are all around. But it was quite bad because the sky got darken so quickly so I was unable to take lots of nice photo. Get there early if you want to take photos, but if you  like to enjoy sunset or night view then it is good to visit on evening too ^^. There will be having a festival here every October so you can visit Haneul park for this festival. Furthermore this is a good place to visit in autumn too~"
19,4.0,"The ""sky"" park is located at the top of 291 steps, an approximately 1km walk away from the World Cup stadium subway, exit 6. For those who do not wish to endeavour the stairs,  there is a buggy type of shuttle service, where you have to purchase tickets before u board the buggy. The sunlight reflects over the fields of eulalia grass, so the best timing for photo enthusiasts to be there is from 4om onwards till sunset."
