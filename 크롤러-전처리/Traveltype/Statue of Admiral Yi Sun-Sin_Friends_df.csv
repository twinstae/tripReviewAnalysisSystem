1,4.0,"This is just outside the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Gwanghwamun Gate. So it is not hard to miss. If you're lucky, you might find a flea market that has stalls that sell Hanbok at cheap prices. So rather than rent, why not buy one and keep it as souvenir."
2,4.0,"Gwanghwamun start from this point. Behind this statue, there is King Sejong statue, Gyeongbok palace and Inwangsan. Quite scenic place to look at the behind."
3,4.0,Admiral Yi Sun-Sin defeated the Japanese invaders during the sixteenth century and is commemorated in this impressive bronze statue.
4,4.0,"This is a cool statue of a man credited for developing the turtle ship that helped defeat the Japanese. You can get some fantastic views of the Gwanghwamun area including Gwanghwamun Gate and Bugak Mountain from long range. It's also conveniently located near Insadong, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and Gyeongbok Palace."

6,4.0,"Not worth travelling there for only this statue but since you'll most likelly be visiting the nearby Palace, have a look"
7,3.0,"If you're going to visit the largest palace (Gyeongbokgung Palace) You might as well take picture with King Sejong and Admiral Yi. They are located at Gwanghwamun Sq, which is a stretch of road leading to the palace. To go here: Take metro line 5 and stop at Gwanghwamun St, exit 2, directly to the Gwanghwamun Sq. Move towards the palace and stop and take pic along the road."
8,3.0,"The admiral cuts an imposing figure on the main boulevard as you walk towards Gyeongbukgung Palace.  Be sure to snap a picture of him as you walk past; just try not to get distracted by the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy located on the other side of the street.  'Murica, indeed."
9,5.0,I've been to Seoul twice and I went there every time. This statue is really an attraction spot. Also there is a naval museum on the underground. It's a must to go if you are already in Seoul City.
