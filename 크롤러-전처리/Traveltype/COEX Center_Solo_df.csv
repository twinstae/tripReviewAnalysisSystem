0,4.0,I came here for a conference and was impressed with its size. Loads of large rooms inside used for conferences - they had about 3 on when I was there each occupying a large room and several other spaces. There’s a multitude of restaurants and places to get food. I believe they have an underground mall as well. Really clean and well kept.

2,3.0,I lived in Seoul for five years and went back to visit after eight years away. The Coex Mall has been remodeled and it is overwhelming. I'm sure Koreans love to go here but it was too confusing for a short visit.
3,5.0,A very unique mall that full of books. You can read books here or taking a few photo of this incredible mall. Worth a visit.
4,2.0,I heard a lot about the COEX mall beforehand and travelled a fair distance on metro to see it for myself. Disappointed. Just a big mall with an aquarium in it.

8,4.0,"You can easily go COEX in Seoul. It has a lot of shopping center, and the aquarium is must visit place."
9,4.0,"The Coex shopping mall is a good place for shopping. You can find anything from interior to fancy clothes. If you want to eat, breakfast, lunch or dinner then you can do this as well. You can easily take the subway to this place (line 2).The Coex mall is located in the Gingham area and with direct access to two Intercontinental hotels by elevator."
