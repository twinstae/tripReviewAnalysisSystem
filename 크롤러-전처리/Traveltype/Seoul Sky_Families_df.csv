It was a very interesting experience - from the interactive movie to the glass floor there is plenty to see. When we visited, the outside deck was closed without advising why. They took many photos at points. A bit expensive to purchase individually 15,000 won each. They should offer a multiple package price which would be more appealing. Definitely something to experience"
1,5.0,We skipped the N tower and come to Seoul Sky for the experience.It’s very convenient as it’s outside of the metro station. Maybe due to the cost there is not a long line. Go during sunset to see sunset and night view of the buzzling city
2,3.0,"Spots visible on every picture taken in daytime. And at night, curved thick windows reflect to much light. Not as exciting as it was 2 years back when views were breathtaking."
3,5.0,"We had five days of cloudy weather in Seoul in early June. We went to the Lotte Tower Seoul Sky on the first sunny day of our trip. I was worried that it would be very crowded on a Saturday, but we got in line for tickets about 30 minutes before the place opened. We were the first people on the elevator. As soon as we got to the top observatory desk, we took photos with very few other people around. After about 15 minutes, large groups of tourists entered and it was much more difficult to take pictures. You cannot buy tickets online unless you have a Korean cell phone. I did buy tickets online through Klook at a slight discount and then showed my phone to the person at the Seoul Sky ticket desk. She printed out our tickets to get on the elevator. I would highly recommend this place, but not on a cloudy or rainy day."
4,4.0,"This place is super cool, but not super cheap, so be aware of the air quality when you decide to visit. We had friends that went on a Saturday and saw basically nothing, and we went the very next day and got post-card-worthy views. So for real--- check the local weather reports.The elevator ride is cool and super fast. It's fun to step out over 120 floors of ""nothing,"" quite a few places to buy food/snacks/drinks, and again, on a good day, a view you won't forget."
5,5.0,Several floors to visit...lots of photo ops....get a drink at the top.  Go during the day when its less busy
6,5.0,Visited Seoul Sky during lunch time on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded to our delight.  We booked through Klook which offered some discount to the entrance tickets.The view from the top is magnificent and worth to be there!
7,5.0,"Seoul Sky Observation Deck is certainly a must do when visiting Seoul. The tour is very well organised, with English-speaking guides at every step. The best time to visit is towards evening – one can see the Seoul skyline....then the sunset...and finally the city lights as they come on. It is a truly amazing experience!! The view from the glass floor can be scary for those having a fear of heights. There are other attractions too – souvenir shops, cafes, photographers – but the best is the artist making sketches while you pose before him!! It takes only a few minutes to do, and can be a souvenir for lifetime!!!This is one experience not to be missed in Seoul."
8,4.0,"Dust fogging up Seoul is a big issue, so watching for clear sky is the biggest factor when going to Seoul Sky. It offers a beautiful 360 view of Seoul. Even the elevator ride is cool with it's visual presentation prior to reaching for the skies. As with most attractions, there's plenty of stop along the way to get that perfect picture for purchase just in case the selfie's and the weather is not all that great because they always have a beautiful blue sky. There's plenty to do around the area, so it worth the going on if you can catch good weather."
9,5.0,"I love Namsan Tower; however, it is a hike to get to and the weather has to be in your favor.   I visited Seoul Sky this past summer (in July) and would recommend Seoul Sky for everyone, especially if you have someone in your group with health issues where going to Namsan tower (walking up incline hills, many stairs, etc) is not easy.   Seoul Sky, you simply go to Lotte Mall and use the elevator. No hills or stairs involved.  They have a glass bottom floor in the observatory which is really cool.  You have a great view looking down at the castle in Lotte World Adventure Park."
10,5.0,"Unbelievable view! Although the sky was a bit unclear, we could see far and beyond. Monies worth...."
11,4.0,"I was dubious about going to this attraction--everyone has been in a tall building--but it was fascinating.  The lower level explains the construction and engineering which was more interesting that i expected.  The elevator up is only a minute and is one of the fastest elevators--there are all sorts of guiness record book items to quote.  I really liked the glass bottom floor, but it took me awhile to step out on it.  Take a picture looking down with your shoes in it for perspective.  I wish we had longer as i would have liked to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge and look at the view!"
12,1.0,Amazing view. 6 storey to appreciate the the beauty of the skyline at a different level. Only thing they can do better is the restaurant manager at the 123 floor not to be snobbish if we happened to be up there not for dinning but just to see how the restaurant is like. Just because we are not dinning there doesn't mean we can't afford to eat there and hence the snobbish treatment.
13,5.0,This place was the highlight of my trip to Seoul! Make sure that you will go there before sunset so you can stay and also see the night view. The entrance fee might be steep but you will forget it once you get to the top. The views were all awesome and jaw dropping!
14,4.0,It is fun to go up so fast to 117 floors in a double-deck elevator.  The view is most precious at sunset so try to go between 5 and 7pm depending on the season so you can watch the sunset and night.
15,5.0,"Worth visiting, nice city view, great souvenirs shops, coffee shop and restaurant. With glass floor view."
16,5.0,Visited with my husband and daughter. Well worth the KRW27000 per adult entrance fee. There is an exhibit at the lower level before heading onto the elevator area. The elevator takes you to the 118th floor in a couple of minutes!You can find a gift shop and coffee shop at the observation deck.The highlight is the glass floored area where you can have your pictures taken. The N Seoul Tower looks so small from this vantage point. :)
17,4.0,"We went to the Seoul sky at the morning time, beautiful view with no rain, we start our journey from the lift, seeing the ancient Seoul develop into Morden time Seoul. Just a few seconds we had already reach to 117/floor.  Impressive view was the first feeling! We walk around the floor and watch the surounding buildings down below were just like toys.  On the 118 floor  two sky deck will prove whether you are afraid the height or not.  After that, we take a coffee break at the 122 floor .  A place must try as you can see the landscape changing.  Will go there again from sunset to night."
18,5.0,"I went here with my wife and two teen age daughters on a Wednesday noon. We avoid weekends as most tourist sites are usually full. But it's already summer in Seoul and most students all over the country are in holiday.The cost is KRW 27,000 per person (adults. foreigners). My daughter who studies in Korea got a discount.Not that crowded and there was around 20-25 people in our batch. When you buy the ticket you'll be asked to choose which time batch you prefer. Each time batch got 30 minutes. Not sure if one can be satisfied with only 30 minutes visit at the observation deck. In our case, perhaps since it was weekdays, all visitors can stay as long as they want.From entrance to elevator we were guided through corridors with information on Seoul Sky construction. Visitors were entertained with images of light. So beautiful!The elevator took visitors in high speed and very convenient. As if it was only some 25-30 storeys. Inside the elevators we were entertained with digital images of the city from all four-sides of elevator's interior. I forgot which floor we stopped. We were asked to continue using escalators to observation deck above. But before that the hall is already an observation deck! You can see several parts of the city.After the escalator you will arrive at the observation deck. Unfortunately the sky was cloudy and view was limited. But still several view could be seen.At the observation deck there were LED monitors visitors can watch. Some spots provide cameras to take a picture of you. Just scan the QR Code on your ticket, and look at the camera. There's a screen mirroring your pose. You can get the printed picture at souvenir shop.Going upstairs, another observation deck. This time a better & huge camera can take a picture of you sitting/ standing on the thick glass floor! Again with QR Code.If you bought the picture you can download the digital picture, given a code.Other than the decks, there were coffee shops. I think there were two. From the seats you can enjoy the view too.The souvenir shop was fun too. I bought a miniature of the tower, to complete my collection of landmark miniatures.In my opinion, in overall experience, SeoulSky was the BEST! I've been to many skyscrapers, and Seoul Sky gave the best experience right from buying the ticket, entrance hall, decks, and return to ground floor."

(I'm supposing because the ticket costs around 27,000 won) I suggest you go when the sky is clear, so that you can see the spectacular view of Seoul! When we visited, we saw the different stadiums, Lotte World, etc. Apart from the world's highest glass observation deck (which is super cool btw), there's a cafe and a gift shop in the top floors, too~ you can sit in the cafe, drink some coffee, and watch the view!"
