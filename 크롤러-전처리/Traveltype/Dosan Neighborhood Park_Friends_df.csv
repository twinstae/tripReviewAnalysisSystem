When Gangum was still just padi fields, they had a big burial ceremony for Dosun who did great things for Education of Koreans and a national fighter. It's really nice to learn and see a little bit of the history in action. The park is now in the midst of a really trendy Neighbourhood and it's quite amazing to see all these Korean flags flying high. The park itself is small and more of a memorial - but I could see children out with their cycles etc."
1,3.0,I read about this little coffee shop online and was excited. This may be what caused me to feel disappointed. The coffee shop is quite small and they really only have coffee. The view is the best aspect of this coffee shop.

There are excellent clean public toilets. There are signs in English and Korean, rocks with carved writing, all telling his story. There is his grave, and finally a huge statue. All in a beautiful relaxing park. I performed DoSan Tul at this location to honour his life under his watch. A fantastic memory for me in South Korea."
