3,4.0,"Its close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. After a lot of walking in the palace, we were very tired to walk here. So we drove around in the car. Its nice little street for a pleasant walk if weather is good. You can see the Bukchon Hanok Village a little uphill and lot of quaint shops Worth a visit if one has time."
4,4.0,"Samcheongdong-gil road is not big road.  However, there are many attractive various flavor of small restaurants, coffee/dessert cafes and nice wine bars.  Visitors can experience old Korean local houses of medium level of gently class.  There is a nice small hiking trail starting from Samcheong park (the north end of Samchedongdong-gil) which leads to Daehakro-road, another tourist attraction road famous for various local play and music theaters.   The trail hiking takes about 30-40 minutes along the old castle wall of the last dynasty."
5,4.0,"This place is replete with history and has quaint cafes and boutiques that dot the narrow alleyways that never fail to surprise you with an unexpected dessert store or restaurant. My personal favourite is a dessert store that offers purple sweet potato ice cream that sits on a little mound of ice shavings, purple sweet potato tiramisu and latte. The shop is so tiny and the patronage so overwhelming that the queue snakes out onto the alleyway."
6,5.0,Great place to spend few hours to walk around. Few great cafe places and you can buy some small but interesting things there. Both of my daughter hired and wore hanbok and walk around the area and the experience was fantastic.
7,5.0,"A mixture of modern and traditional Korean, this place is a fantastic exploration. Many unique and great cafe around the area. Best to be explored on foot."
8,5.0,"Must visit place if you are in town. Would recommend walking through insadong to Samcheongdong then back by bus or doing it the other way around, by going by bus to one end first. Make sure to wear a hanbok. If not you can always rent one!"
9,5.0,"There are lots of tradition Korean houses in many alleys. Many locals and visitors take photos there, some of them even wear tradition clothing. However, those houses are private. Signages of ""Silence"" are hanged everywhere. So if you're planning to visit there with children, please notice that if may not very suitable. It takes 15-20 mins walk to go up from Gyeongbokgung. I recommend you to go to Gyeongbokgung first then walk to Samcheongdong to have tea as there are also many cute cafes."
10,5.0,"The environment is very friendly, it's trendy, lively during the day and at night. Great coffee shops, galleries, museums and some restaurants. Love that it's mixed with the Hanok style home, it gives the area a very unique feeling, experience and charm. A must come and spend a day perusing the area."

12,4.0,"Samcheongdong-gil is very close to Gyeongbokgung, so it's a perfect area for a meal and a stroll after visiting the vast palace.  The area is not crowded and full of many lovely gift shops, cafes, and restaurants.  It's like the mix between old and new, with traditional houses and modern buildings lining two sides of the street in a harmonious way.I had lunch at the popular Samcheongdong Sujebi place.  Luckily it was past lunch time and we got the table right away!  The food was good and warming.  Service was minimal but acceptable considering it's a local noodle shop, not a fancy restaurant.  Staff can speak very little English but it was not a large menu to choose from. Public restroom is clean and convenient...even beautifully-designed.  The Beansbin coffeeshop is worth checking-out.  Very nice atmosphere and good coffee."
13,5.0,Some lovely art galleries and boutiques dot this street. There are also many cafes and dessert places to be found here. Great for people who want to browse shops on a lazy afternoon.
14,5.0,A little neighbourhood with many cafes and boutique shops. You will find many artistic and unique architecture here. Lovely place to stroll around and enjoy the surroundings. Many gingko trees that made up a colorful street during autumn and early winter.
15,5.0,"On a good day with nice weather, and good walking shoes, this road is perfect to walk around and maybe get lost in. There are nice cafes and boutiques to entertain you. It is a different vibe from the other neighborhoods in Seoul."

17,4.0,"A nice place with many restaurants, bistro, ice cream/coffee cafes, galleries and small boutique shops. It is crowded with many young adults during weekends. It is beautiful during autumn with coloured leaves and cooling weather. Take a nice stroll there after lunch to relax yourself."
18,3.0,Recommended to walk here after visiting Bukchon Village. A lot of cafes with their own authentic foods. There's also some stores.
19,4.0,"I really liked walking around here! I regret not spending more time though. I wasn't able to explore the place as much as I wanted. Anyway, this is an excellent mix of the old and new. Very interesting! Lots of cafes and restaurants here too. You can pass by Samcheongdong to get to Bukchon Hanok Village. Look for the stairs."
20,5.0,"Very pleasant strip of shops and restaurants.  There are several sidewalk sales, the price is very reasonable.  Trust me I'm a a bargain shopper.  There are 2 Churros places, you must try either one is good.  We walked here after visiting Bukchon then walked to Gyeongbokgung.  All so close together."
21,3.0,"Again, this is one of the areas in Seoul highly recommended by blogs/people etc. Its actually really close by Gyeongbuk Palace (just beside it) but it’s abit of a long walk from the main entrance. The streets are really pretty and we took a lot of photos there. Lots of interesting cafes but I noted a lack of restaurants/places selling “proper” full meals at affordable prices. Also, I felt that what a lot of people don’t mention is how pricey things are in this area. I ended up not doing any shopping and just browsed around. There are lots of quaint/independent shops selling hand-crafted accessories and you won’t find these stores anywhere else. Overall, a nice place for a stroll and a coffee or ice-cream but things are on the pricey end. Also, it has become a very touristy area and I have a tendency to want to stay away from areas that have too many tourists. Sad to say I was pretty disappointed and though I found the area to be really lovely, I feel that it tends to be a little over-rated by people."
22,4.0,"From Bukchon Hanok Village, we took a stroll along Samcheongdong before heading to Gyeongbokgung Palace. I love the relaxing atmosphere of the place. The streets are lined with coffee shops, tea houses, restaurants, book stores, and even souvenir shops."
23,4.0,"This is a nice road lined with shops, cafe and cute attractions. You just need to connect this to your temple tour or to your hanok sightseeing. We ate at chefchi which was cheap and delicious."
24,4.0,"The road along this stretch is narrowed. Some parts of it is highly guarded as it is near the President Palace. But this is a beautiful street with cafe of characters. If you walk along the street and lift up your head to look across, you will see different characters (art piece ) perching on the roof top. Explore the cafe inner or along the side street. Many of them are above the road and have a fairly good view. It's like a arty place for people who are interested in arts and like to take things slow."
