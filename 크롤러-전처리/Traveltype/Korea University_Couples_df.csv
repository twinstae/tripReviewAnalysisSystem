I have been lucky enough to see four seasons on this campus and I can guarantee no matter which time you come, you will have a lovely time exploring.There are some great photo opportunities here as well, such as in front of Central Plaza and the Science Campus gardens. It's also a great place to have a picnic or just relax, taking in the scenery."

It is very well built and modern. There are some cafes, fast food restaurants, convenient stores, book store and etc within the campus. Felt impressed by the architecture. It is located very near to Anam station (line 6). If you are nearby the campus, take a walk there and look at the architectures. Nice!"
