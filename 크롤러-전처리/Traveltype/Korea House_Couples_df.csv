They offer different ticket options, like show and dinner, and dinner itself has different options, depending on the food you want to eat, or the kind of service you want to have, etc.... The show is a total representation of the old Korean cultures as shown through the evolution of their music and dance. The food...I don’t really like the food, but it’s worth it if you want to try culturally or historically sourced food, and the servers are wearing period Korean attires."
1,5.0,"We went for a traditional meal, we didn't see the show. We initially balked at the price, but we got the mid-priced option and it was enough food. The meal was one of the best I had on the trip, and it makes for a very photogenic spread. For our weekday lunch, we were one of three total groups, and really appreciated a lot of the traditional touches (like taking off your shoes and wearing slippers to walk to the dining table. The food was excellent as well, very fresh and unique flavors. We wanted to go back for the show, but it didn't work out for our trip."
2,4.0,I only did the show - did not get dinner with the show.We really enjoyed the performance which showcased many of the different traditional dances & music.  The performers were also entertaining and engaging - audience participation was a bonus :)
3,2.0,"We went for the Pansori performance and dinner last night. Most of the performance was excellent - talented musicians, dancers and performers, but there was at least 1/3 of cheesy audience participation. Tickets for this were ~£35 per person for an hour.The bigger disappointment of the night was dinner. We went for the cheapest menu and that was still ~£55 per person excluding drinks. We were expecting 9 leisurely courses of royal cuisine in an atmospheric Hanok. Instead we got 9 courses in 55 minutes like it was the chef’s hometime with multiple dishes served at once in a neon bright room with no atmosphere. The food itself was perfectly tasty, but I enjoyed my £5 meal from Gwangjang Market 10 times more.Would not recommend due to how significantly overpriced it was for the experience."
4,5.0,My husband and I just finished with the show at Korea House in Seoul at 6:30pm. We loved it! Great performance. Recommend.
5,4.0,"We made our reservation via the Korea House website.  They responded in a timely manner to confirm reservation.  Also, the website provided us an opportunity to view the numerous menu choices and decide upon which dinner we would like.  The dinner/show were not cheap.  A lot more than we have ever paid for dinner and a show.  Also, we both had to choose the same dinner choice and could not make separate meal choices.We arrived late, because we walked from our hotel and had some GPS issues finding the place.  However, when we provided our name, they immediately seated us in a room with other folks in it and table by ourselves.We received numerous dishes for dinner that were definitely fit for a king/queen.  We ordered wine which was great.  We were received a ticket during dinner for the show.  The ticket had our assigned seat for the show on it.The dinner ended with a few minutes to spare to attend the show.  Also, there was time to have a bathroom break.The show was superb.  I have been to a number of shows, but nothing like this.  It is a performance that is well worth seeing!  Also, we had great seats.  We met the cast of the show, after the show in the lobby."
6,4.0,"The show was nothing short of spectacular. My wife and I enjoyed every second of it. However, there were bunch of Chinese business type travelers showed up way late and spoiled the flow of the show. Additionally, they had the balls to walk around the theater with their cellphone flashlights on! So rude and inconsiderate. Once they sat down in the middle of the show while blinding everyone with their stupid flashlights, they began looking at their phone with their bright screens. It seems like everywhere you go in the world, Chinese tourists are rude and inconsiderate. They act as if the rules don't apply to them..."

8,1.0,"A friend stateside recommended we try the palace royal food experience. Only a few places in Seoul do it and this is one of them. Our hotel was close to this location and they made the reservation for us. I write this review trying to be fair and honest. I wanted to love this and it was my fault for not really fully reading the other reviews and understanding what they were saying. This experience was horrible. The service was so so at best, you are in this lovely traditional Korean house, yet the room we sat in felt like a cheap buffet lit with office lighting. The staff didn't explain anything and most of the girls were cold and dismissive, with an exception of two. We were rushed into making a selection for our course and just chose one at a glance (happened to be the most expensive of course!)Every single dish was basically horrible, not just bad but horrible. I don't know what palace food was like, but it lacked taste. Most of it was tasteless food that was not appetizing in any way. Yes the portions were small but I have had course meals before and been very satisfied. My biggest issue was the experience could have been amazing if the staff explained the dishes, such as when they were prepared which dynasty etc. even if we weren't a fan of the food if we felt like it was a historical meal we would have been ok spending the insane money we spent. It was insanely overpriced, and I am highly disappointed in the fact we just wasted over $200usd that could have been used for something worth while. Save your money or go to the show and skip the meal at all costs. Please trust me."
9,4.0,"Very nice show, we found it interesting and very professional. the music, specially drummers are amazing.the effects are nice, i think there are two shows per day we had the one at 18:30 and it lasts one hour, we made reservation via internet and came a little before to pay and pick up the tickets. the place was rather empty and not too many people for the show. the show itself is not fully on english but it is rather visual so everything is quite understandable.the cost per ticket is 40 euro."
10,3.0,The show tells a story through dance and music.  Used several nice effects.Included some audience participation which was not needed and made me cringe.It only lasts one hour and after the show you can have your photo taken with the performers.  We went on a Sunday at 18.30 and the audience was small.  As we left a coach load arrived for the next performance.I gave it 6 out of 10.  The person I went with gave it 1.5 !
11,2.0,We came here for dinner during our vacation in Seoul. we tried the basic prefix menu which costs around $60/person. The price does NOT meet the taste plus the portion was too small. I won't recommend to eat here.Perhaps the show is pretty good from other viewers.
12,5.0,"After a nice imperial diner at the Korea house, we went into this relatively small theater with a bit less than 200 seats. Quickly, the show started : this was a blast from the start to the end !The show is about the story of Sim Cheong, a daughter who has sacrificed her life for her blind father to get back his sight. It mixes a lot of arts : from traditional music to acting, painting, dancing. A transparent screen on which some videos are projected helps the local and foreign spectators to follow the story between each act.I am so glad I was brought there to view such a well thought, designed and executed show.This comes at an affordable price, I will strongly advise any of my friend visiting Seoul to see the show.Bravo !"
13,4.0,"We did have an awesome dinner at Korea House in terms of yummy food stuff and great services. From the main menu, we did reserve for their well-known royal cuisine, which includes the signature dishes in the restaurant. They all tasted so good that we stopped to eat them up and definitely forgot our muffin top for the whole nite. Please be reminded to make a reservation in advance and enjoy with a nice experience right there"
14,4.0,"I'd recommend the one-hour traditional dance and music performance here, made up of eight different sections: some ensemble pieces, others duets.  The music, played on pipes, drums and stringed zither-like intstruments, is also very good, almost more interesting than the dance.I'm no expert on Korean culture, so I can't say how authentic the performances are, but they are certainly beautiful and well-performed. I didn't eat here, so I can't comment on the quality of the dining which is also on offer in packages with the dance performance."
15,5.0,"We went there just for a performance, and did not attend the dinner (please note that to attend dinner you will need to come an hour earlier. Dinner is BEFORE the performance). It was positively awesome expirience. The performance consists of nine short numbers (dances, oral performances, traditional instruments), all of them different and fascinating. I had my doubts before booking, but local friends said it is quite authentic.Most of the seats were prebooked for group tours so we had to choose out of the first and the last row. Turned out, what is built as an ""elevated stage"" for Koreans, is quite comfortable to watch from the first row for Caucasians 170-180 cm tall =)))"
16,3.0,"The pre-dinner show was good it was W45000 then we dined afterward in the traditional house behind the theatre..We chose the Cheongwu Jeongsik at W88,000.Setting was authentic.We sat on the floor to eat.Floor was heated ? the old fashioned way?Food was no good.Basa (cheap frozen kind)fish  was used ."
17,5.0,"This was one of my favorite dining experiences in Korea.  The food is served in low tables.  The staff was highly helpful, especially considering that I did not know how to eat some of the dishes on offer, so they explained everything. Finally, the food itself was delicious and very well executed.  Overall, a must for any first-time visitor to Korea."
18,5.0,"We first heard about this show while we were on the Seoul City Tour.  Decided to do this on our own by calling Korea House and making reservations.  We did it only for the performance (USD 50) and had dinner on our own.  This is an incredible show displaying amazing talent by various artists.  I would go there again next time I am in Seoul.  Also, do take your camera; you are allowed taking pictures (just no flash); we didn't take ours thinking there won't be any photography allowed.  Also, if you are traveling form Gangnam area in the evening please give yourself over an hour to get there."
19,4.0,"we join the handstyle program with a discount rate which is only cost 20k won per person.. the activity which is included in the program is to learn how to make korean food, wearing hanbok, learning Korean words (just how to write your name) and enjoy thier traditional dance/performance.. the experience is pretty good.. whole program is about 3 hours.. love it and it worth to try out.. :D"
