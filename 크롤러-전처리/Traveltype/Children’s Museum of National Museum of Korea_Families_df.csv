0,4.0,"We visited here during our winter holiday. This museum was not big enough and had so many activities for kids. Most of the informations were in Hangeul, but our children could enjoy it. There are some activities that required papers (the papers are not free). Near this museum is a lounge for parents and kids to eat n rest. For foods, you can buy there (a lot of cafes) or bring your own. They provides mineral water for free. This museum is free of charge, but you need to register first because it has 6 sessions a day. To see which session that you want, please check at website and come at least 30 minutes before it."

2,4.0,"You'll get free tickets for the sessions at the reception counter and each session last for slightly less than 2 hours which was appropriate for young kids.  We didn't speak Korean but the kids still enjoyed a good mix of drawing / puzzle / games.  Also a great way to learn about Korean culture.  For some of the activities, you will need to buy a folder at the gift shop and costed around KRW1,2000.  The adjacent food court provided a good range of food options - Tonkatsu was a popular choice and looked delicious."
3,3.0,"This is a tiny museum inside the National Museum of Korea. Good for maybe a 30min walk through. Only a few exhibits were in English but the kids could understand most of it. Mostly interactive exhibits, many puzzles, and a dress up part where you could take pictures wearing a Korean king and queen costume. Free entrance."

The museum got 3 floors with different kinds of activities for different age groups, and most of the activities are quite detail and educational.  My 3 year olds boy loves it so much.. he didn't want to leave."
