The Court is situated in this area and I took the chance to explore the attractions nearby. Here, you can find Bukchon Hank Village, Gyeongbokgung Palace and various other palaces and attractions. To go here, take the subway Line 3 and alight at Anguk Station and use exit 2."

Also, generally it is possible to see some street activities or market places. Prices in shops and in restaurants are above the average level of Seoul. Walking along this road can be quite enjoyable activity on a warm day."
5,4.0,The Road has a very beautiful view but such a very small tiny road.  It has coffee shop and restaurant.

11,4.0,"A must visit. Samcheongdong is slightly different from Bukchon. You will see more traditional houses in the latter. But you will see modern places such as cafes. Yet, within each cafe (majority of them), its interior has a blend of traditions and culture. An interesting place."

13,5.0,"My first visit to Insa Dong Korean Art Street 인사동길 and Samcheong-dong, Seoul. I was born and raised mostly in Seoul but this is my first visit to Samcheongdong. I assumed it was a tourist attraction and didn't even know where it is located. I'm totally in love with this place and even planning to go back on my next day-off with a proper camera. So much traditional and contemporary culture to enjoy!! BTW, I was a little overwhelmed by so many Chinese tourists there. They seem to be everywhere on this planet :)수도권살면서 태어나서 처음으로 삼청동에가봄. 사실 어딘지 잘몰랐음. 서울을 돌아다니는것도 꽤나 신기방기 엄청 스트레스풀리는일임. 어째서 나는 곳을 이제 알게됫는가?! 중국 단체관광객들 엄청나게많은데 시끄러움 ㅠ_ㅠ) 다음주에 또가야징"
14,5.0,"I highly recommend this area to all the foreign visitors. There are bunch of pretty cafes and stores and you can see some traditional Korean buildings here. As a native Korean, I like to spend an afternoon with my friends drinking a couple of teas in cafes. And it's close to Gwanghwamoon so after you visit there, you can come by here.외국친구들이 오면 데리고 갈만한데가 아닌가 싶습니다 인사동은 이미 너무 상업화되고 관광객이 많아 재미도 없고 특색도 잃어가니 말이죠."
15,3.0,"Tons of eateries and cafes in the main street and in the smaller alleys. Shopping is more expensive in this area, and there was a huge influx of tour groups when I visited so it wasn't a very good experience. The street is slowly losing its original charm."
16,3.0,The old architecture of common peoples houses are worth your time. Lots of the restaurants and cafe foods are gentrified you need to take close attention before you decide to spend lot of money.Try to explore the smaller streets and alley behind the main avenue. That's where real fun shops and independent cafes are located.
17,5.0,"I would absolutely recommend Samcheongdong to anyone and everyone who is planning to visit Seoul. It's just opposite Insadong and near Bukchon Hanok Village too. Lots of restaurants, eateries, cafes, shops and art murals can be found here!Also chanced upon restaurants where 'Running Man' and 'Superman Returns' (Song Triplets) filmed for one of their episodes! Love the feel of Samcheongdong~"
