0,5.0,"This is probably one of my most favorite Palace in Seoul, definitely in the top three. It seems like it lies in the center of Seoul the way it is positioned surrounded by modern architecture of Seoul, hotels, restaurants, the City Hall and other important buildings. It’s so easy to get to by train, bus or taxi and it is within walking distance to other attractions. The Palace house also a gallery and a shop. It’s great to stroll around these old buildings and imagine how life might have been way back in the Joseph Dynasty. Right outside of the Palace in the small street on the right of it lies a famous Belgian waffle shop which I’d recommend trying. It’s not Korean but it is claimed to be one of the top 5 dessert shops in Seoul."
1,4.0,Good display of the Changing of the Guard on the outside of the palace gates between 10:00-14:00. You don’t need a ticket to watch it from the street. Lasts about 15 minutes with photo opportunities with the actors after the show is over. Worth the trip to see the traditional dress and the parade.
2,3.0,Changing of the guards was interesting! Like a short theatre production. Interesting history and buildings. Didn't stay long but unfortunately to walk around. Probably would have leqrnedy more if we rented audio guides or took one of the scheduled free tours.
3,4.0,Small place which only takes half an our or so to walk around.  Not much to see inside.  The main attraction is the changing of the guard ceremony.  It was excellent.  Lots of interesting uniforms to look at and excellent drummers.
4,3.0,Compared to the other palaces this one has little to offer. As there are just a few buildings where you can walk around and look less impressive compared to others.
5,4.0,"Deoksugung palace is very interesting palace for me.Beside the location that in the middle of the city and just next to city hall.the palace was very easy to reach.This palace also smaller than the other two I've been visited.But its nice to started your palace tour with this one.Its like past and present met in one place.There are few historic pavilions and yet there are modern and western buildings in same complex.Very interesting for see.but not much to explore.But its very nice experience, especially if you came when the guard changing ceremony.Extra info : When you get hungry, and need something to snack on.you can try waffles just next to it."
6,5.0,"located at the intersection of Seoul's busiest city center. This is the only palace surrounded by Western-style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the scenery. It is the smallest of the five royal palaces in Korea. The palace building is a blend of Korean culture and Western culture. When walking to the palace, it is recommended to walk to the side of the palace. Around November. The leaves will turn orange. Beautiful decoration"
7,5.0,"[More food and travel experience on my Instagram @oppakuliner]Had a very good time here, so i went here before the palace opens for public. And when they're open, there's a ritual in the front of palace from a guardian of palace. And it was cool ! The inside of palace also great and i spend quite a long time here"
8,4.0,"The ticket is only KR₩ 1000! You will find a traditional atmosphere there. Although it is not as big as other palaces, you still can enjoy! There is a museum also inside the palace but we didn’t enter. The unique accent in this palace is a blend between traditional and modern culture"
9,4.0,"A unique palace on its own, Deoksugung palace shows us a glimpse of how the old and new could co-exist together.Entry free is only 1000krw, however you could purchase the combination ticket at 10000 krw (if you plan to visit all the palaces including Jongmyo shrine) as it will save you 4000 krw.In the palace, you could also opt to visit the National museum of modern and contemporary art at an additional cost (It was 2000krw for us at the time).We love that this palace is also so close to City Hall as it allows us to smoothly go to our next destination easily."
10,5.0,Deoksugung Palace is a very unique place to visit for me. On one hand you have a great historical site and just beyond the walls of the palace is the ultra-modern Seoul City Hall and large hotels towering into the sky. The palace itself is a blend of traditional and modern buildings. The palace originated in the mid 1400's and continued to evolve in the 1900's so there is a mixture of buildings on the site. Great to see and well worth the 1000 Won entry fee. The palace is free for seniors.
11,5.0,This is a very unique palace to visit because you see many types of palaces in one place. I recommend it to everyone!
12,5.0,"I have visited in the past and enjoy the colorful changing of the guard ceremony.  Please see my review from 2012, my first visit, for exact directions and location of Deoksugung Palace.  All renovations now completed inside.  Our visit this time, all changing of the guard ceremonies were cancelled because of the hot weather.  Always be cognizant of the current weather, as they may cancel ceremonies if toohot or too cold."
13,4.0,This palace is perfect from some history lover. You can see traditional palace and some western style building here. You also can see some royal guard changing ceremony. I forgot the detail but I see this ceremony on Sunday around 2 or 3 pm. You can also took a picture with the guard after the ceremony.
14,5.0,"We managed to secure tickets for the Secret Garden in Deoksugung on our first day in Seoul and all other days for our Seoul trip was sold out. While the weather forecast was not good, we proceeded on to visit this palace and its garden.Of course, it would be a much better visit in gorgeous autumn weather, but we managed to enjoy the gardens and the castle complex with its spectacular foliage before the huge downpour. Do allow at least half a day in good weather to fully appreciate this complex."
15,3.0,The backdrop with leaves etc was dramatic. But there really isn’t anything to see inside the structures and we could only appreciate from the outside. Wish there was more. The changing of the guards was a nice bonus.
16,3.0,"I plan to go to other palace, but our dinner dragged on until 2pm. This palace seems to be the only one still open (without reservation).The lightning is not good enough so we weren’t able to truly appreciate the palace, but it’s a unique feeling strolling around the historic place at night."
17,4.0,"The Changing of the Guards ceremony was quite elaborate and more detailed than that of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Unfortunately, the viewing area was smaller so it was hard to enjoy all the pageantry, drills and musical instruments.  The grounds of this palace are adjacent to the City Hall so one sees the contrast of the modern and traditional buildings."
18,3.0,"This is a place with a very interesting history, but they have not made anything of it. It is some nice buildings and very little information. That's it."
19,5.0,"Korea is rich in its history, this is just one of the many palaces to visit. The recent Goblin drama was flimed outside the walls of this palace too :)"
20,5.0,We visited this palace during a bright sunny day.  Encountered some outdoor traditional Korean entertainment during our visit.  It was a great experience!  On the good side of this visit is that the entrance fee is waived for foreigners and we could go back as many times as we wanted.  We opted to go back a second time during our stay in Seoul because we were with a local friend who couldn't enter one of the buildings without registering on-line.
21,4.0,It's one of those smaller palaces but nice to visit and get your photo-ops. Go buy the Palace all-in ticket at KW10000. It's worth it!
22,4.0,"This is a relatively small park and I will recommend coming here during the change of guard for photo opportunity.Apart from that, it is a nice and relaxing place to take a stroll in the area and view both traditional and modern architecture within a single location."
23,4.0,"Went to this palace as part of a half day tour. Really quaint and pretty   Beautiful structures with colorful roofs. At 11 amThey do a changing of the guards I likes this visit a lot. But don't do a tour , read up on it and take your time. The grounds are beautiful."
24,4.0,This was our first Korean palace experience. We enjoyed walking around the grounds. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. I recommend adding this to your itinerary. Entrance fee is small and it's a great way to spend an hour or two.
25,4.0,One of the palace in seoul. Located in city hall. They have a changing of guard ceremony every day. Entrance fee is 1000 krw.
26,5.0,"While this palace doesn't have the sprawling grounds of some of the others - it is stunning. The lawns are so well-manicured, and the mixture of the architecture styles is quite interesting to see. Some of the more ""European"" style buildings were constructed on the palace grounds during the Japanese occupation I believe. there is also a small annex of the Seoul City Art Museum inside the grounds which holds small exhibitions. I got to see a gorgeous collection of antique Cartier jewelry by chance in there one day. Such a fun surprise. I would say this palace is a must see!"
27,5.0,"Amazing temple. Great location in City Hall. Entrance is 1,000 KRW. Tours in English available. Good for pictures"
28,4.0,"do your research and dont be like lazy tourist me. after walking 10-15 mnt from gyeongbokgung in hot scorching sun, i arrive at deoksugung, only to find out its close on monday -_-;"
29,4.0,"I kinda like visiting those palaces and stuff whenever I am travelling. I have to say that although this might not be one of the best, but still it was worth a visit.They had this changing guard ceremony everyday at 11am (if I was not mistaken). Probably you should not miss it as it might be the highlight of the place.But to keep those traditional palace surrounded by tall buildings and in the heart of the city, was amazing."
30,5.0,"While not as large as Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung or Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace is the serene and beautifully-canopied seat of Korea's brief imperial power. As it was originally constructed as a residence not designated for royalty, Deoksugung possesses a humble quality enhanced by the beautiful foliage landscaping the premises. It is historically significant as the only imperial palace and the place where Emperor Gojong died in 1919. It is a beautiful mix of eastern and western architecture, a testament to Gojong's desire to lead Korea onto the world stage in the early 20th century. The thrice-daily changing-of-the-guard ceremony transports visitors back to the Joseon dynasty and is a must-see if visiting this palace. Admission is inexpensive and guided tours are free. Our English tour guide was charming, polite and well-versed to answer questions."
31,5.0,"I love the grandiose Royal Changing of Guards here! If I were you, go at the entrance if they will be having the said ceremony. See it up close and take a picture with the guards!"
32,5.0,"There is a great changing of the guards ceremony at around 11 AM, it is absolutely worth it. The palace grounds are beautiful, with many nice areas to take pictures, especially in the gardens. Surrounded by skyscrapers, it's definitely a nice natural and historical haven right in the middle of the city."
33,4.0,"I have been to Seoul in November, 2015 in good weather although its cloudy and some time rainy however very enjoyable if you have fear to get wet by rain bring an umbrella with you. This Ancient Palace is located in Seoul city surrounded by the modern urban infrastructure, it is near to the City Hall Station Sub-way. The palace belong to the Joseon Dynasty. You will feel very nice after entering inside, most of the area is surrounded by the plantation and in Autumn seasons different shades of maples pleasing the viewers, the nature lovers will definitely love this place. In a very big compound there are different types of building of 15th & 16th century, people who like to visit historical places & attraction, this place is definitely worth to visit, for close attention and details you should have sufficient time considering the opening and closing of the palace. There is museum inside (basement, 1st and 2nd floor) and to visit the place prior reservation is required via Deoksugung homepage."
34,5.0,"We watched the full changing guard ceremony and got the chance to wear Korean hanbok free for tourist (before entering the gate, there's a booth on the right that provides Korean traditional clothes for tourist to wear, just need to fill out your name) and took a photo with the head of guards. The booth closed around 2 or 3 pm. Very memorable!"
35,4.0,I was glad to see this palace just wish it was in the day not night time even though the lighting was kind of nice at night.
36,5.0,"There are other main palaces that are closer to each other and make it easier for people to do palace tours at the same day, and Deoksugung is often left out because it is a little far and in different direction. But it's right across Seoul city hall and very easy to find. It has nice parks and very unique because it has museums within it too. During weekends and holidays I think there are highschool student volunteers doing English guide. I went in August 15th, the Korean Independence Day, and they opened for free. There will be some other national holidays when they open for free so check it out before the visit."
37,4.0,We stumbled on this palace on our way from Namsan Park to Gyeongbukgong Palace.  It costs about $2 USD to enter the palace and it is certainly worth it.  Spend about half an hour wandering the beautiful grounds.
38,5.0,"The palace complex is a wonderful place to roam around. The main throne room has a decorated ceiling that is really intricate, detailed and colourful. Many other buildings also add to the understanding of how court life must have functioned. To see all of the buildings, be prepared to spend the whole day."
39,4.0,"This palace is an ocean of serenity in the middle of a very busy part of Seoul and while the palace deserve a visit as it is, the change of guards is a fantastic sight to see, great and a fantastic recreation of Korean history"
40,4.0,"We visited Deoksugang Palace on a recent visit to Seoul.  It makes a great stop if you have a limited amount of time to visit one of the four main palaces in Seoul.  It gives you a taste of what the palaces were like back in the time of the Joseon Dynasty.  This palace complex is compact, all the sites are within easy walking distance of each other, and the signs are in English as well as Korean.  It is easy to get to either by subway or via the ""Hop on, Hop off"" city bus tour of Seoul.  Consider a visit here if your time in Seoul or interest in Korean palaces is limited.  It is worth a half-hour to an hour of your time."
41,4.0,Take a stroll near the wall to see the beautiful Ginko tree line. Just don't step on it's fruit or you'll smell like dog poop forever!
42,4.0,"The entrance fee is cheap and the palace isn't that big, so be sure to stop by even you have little time because it's worth it. Though it's small, but it's beautifully compact. Be sure to walk along the path on the outer part of the gate because the road is one not to be missed for it's beauty in all season."
43,4.0,"not wearing the hanbok, yet i still feel like a princess taking a stroll around the castle, listening to the birds & enjoying the weather"
44,4.0,This looked like one of the smaller palaces but it provides a lovely glimpse of old traditional historical palaces looked like. We went on a quiet day so didn't get swamped by crowds.
45,2.0,"As far as Korean historical sites in the area go, this is one of the least attractive. First There is a lot of ongoing consruction which always seems to interfere with photos. Also, there is a lot of more Western buildings which housed legislative offices. If life mited on time I would opt out of this site for the more beautiful Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden. But if a history buff, it is worth a visit."
46,3.0,"Deoksu Palace served as the king's residence twice during Josecon.  The site was originally the home of Prince Wolsan, and King Seonjo lived here temporarily after returning to the capital following the withdrawal of Japanese forces in 1593."
47,3.0,"Smaller than Geongbukkung (not sure I spelled it right). It has its charm, but the great palace is better."
48,5.0,For a reasonable price they take you back in time to enjoy Korea in the feudal ages. As one of the oldest castle is a must see attraction.
49,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung (Kyongbok) may be the largest Joseon (Choson) dynasty palace in Seoul, but Deoksugung (Daekso, Duksoo) is perhaps the most charming. The central palace itself is small and empty except for the throne in the middle of the throne room, but the details on the roof are exquisite. The small side buildings are also worth investigating, including the bizarre hybrid turn-of-the-century Russian gazebo behind the main palace building. Make sure to check out the impressive Buddhist bells on the grounds of the palace. The contrast with surrounding modern buildings is striking and makes for a good photo. But the most impressive thing to see is actually the changing of the guard, where sentinels in colorful Joseon dynasty costumes parade about in front of the entrance gate. If you arrive 15 or 20 minutes before the changing of the guard, go inside the palace grounds to see them marching out of the gate before beginning the ceremony. After a short display of martial arts, there's a moment when they allow tourists to have their pictures taken with the (unsmiling) guards; you'll only have a few minutes, so if you're interested, be quick to take advantage of the opportunity. Check in advance for the schedule for the changing of the guard. Changdeokgung may have the Piwon (Secret Garden) -- the single most interesting Joseon dynasty site in Seoul -- but the grounds are enormous; Deoksugung is much more manageable and can easily be seen in an hour."
50,5.0,"I find that the most interesting thing about this palace compared to the others in Seoul is that shows the Joseon/Daehan royal family's late attempts to Westernize, which can be seen in the architecture.  It's a pity that so much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese after King Gojong died.  The complex also contains one of the very few historic 2-story buildings from old Korea. (Most buildings in traditional Korean architecture only had one floor.)"
51,5.0,"I have always wanted to see the inside of this palace! Deoksugung was featured in the popular Korean drama called “Goong” or “Princess Hours” but it’s so much more than that. Built in the late 14th Century, this palace still stands today as a reminder of Korea’s rich cultural past. For less than the price of using the buses in South Korea, people get to walk through the royal palace grounds and see the throne room of the king. The mighty throne with two golden dragons swirled in the roof over the throne gives the feeling of power and might. During my time there, there were two young men who performed with long sabers in an intricate dance of the ancient king’s warriors. If you’re a nature lover, the trees, bushes, and flowers are absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend entering the courtyard in the center and walking down the stone path to king’s throne room for that is the very path that many a foreign dignitary had taken. The King had a separate room for his queen, servants, children, guests, and guards so there are many rooms to look inside of. The sparse furniture used back then allows the visitors to see the traditional ways of life for the King. It truly is a must see while taking a tour of Seoul's historical sights!"
52,5.0,"There’s not much to really say about shrines and palaces, but I think the Jongmyo Shrine and Deoksugung Palace is definitely worthy of your visit. You’re literally walking in world history and it’s something that many of us young folks have taken for granted."
53,5.0,"We visited this palace, and found it was very peaceful and beautiful with the cherry trees in blossom."
54,4.0,"There are many palaces in Seoul, but none are as quaint as Deoksugung.  It's probably the smallest palace but they have a changing of the guard ceremony on the hour daily.  What I like the most about this place is that it is smack in the middle of the city, so you can see Seoul's skyline at night as a backdrop to the many buildings.  Also, there is a western-designed structure that I believe has been converted to some art museum.  Don't forget that this any most other palaces are closed on Mondays and go on a clear night for one of the best palace experiences in Seoul."
55,4.0,"When you visit this palace, please make sure to time it with the guard changing. Its really nice to see young men parading :)"
56,3.0,"It's nice to found such historical and cultural place in the middle of the city.Here you can see the history of the place and found the museum inside the palace area.Also, there's a small pathway outside the palace that famous because of the view and the story behind it."
57,5.0,"This beautiful, historic palace sits in the very heart of downtown Seoul.  It is nearly directly across from the City Hall building (which is an incredible mix of old and new itself).My husband, myself, and our Korean friend, Mee-Kang spent a relaxing spring day here.  It is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle from one of the largest cities in the world.  The grounds are shaded and beautifully kept.  You can pay for a guide or follow along in a pamphlet or map.  We were lucky enough to have a personal friend guiding us.I am not for certain, but I seem to recall her saying that a few, historical K-Dramas had been filmed at this palace.  The classic, Korean architecture has been very well maintained; and you can take a peak into the throne room and personal living chambers of the king and queen themselves.Toward the back of the palace was a small museum with artwork from several well-known Korean artists.  Admission is free with your Changdeokgung Palace ticket, and I highly recommend you take a moment to peruse the selection within.One of my favorite parts of this palace tour was visiting the first ""coffee shop"" in Korea.  Apparently, one of the kings who inhabited the palace was a great coffee lover; so, he created a little pavilion in which to enjoy his favorite beverage.  You can take off your shoes, slip on some house shoes and walk around inside of it.  It's great fun to imagine what it would have been like to witness a real coffee ceremony with the king so long ago.I would recommend visiting this palace on an ""off-day"" - a weekday that's not so busy, perhaps.  Just remember that most Korean establishments are closed on Mondays.  I think it only cost 3 or 5 US dollars to gain entrance.  I'm not sure how this would bode for those in wheelchairs, pushing strollers, or on crutches.  The outside gardens and walkways would be just fine, but once you got to the main buildings and had to traverse the centuries old thresholds I think it would present a challenge. :-(  Also, not so sure young children would have the attention span to fully enjoy this palace; but older children might have a lot of fun following along on the map and reading the place markers explaining what each building housed and what its purpose was."
58,5.0,"While living in Korea, we traveled to and visited many sights. The palaces located in Seoul make it easy to travel a short distance to be transported back in time when emporers ruled. This one is beautiful in many season and relatively flat for those with physical impairments. And the admission cost is perfect for me as I'm a shoestring-budget tourist, by choice. By far, this is my favorite of the ones located within Seoul. Small but absolutely enthralling. This one also displays ancient artifacts invented by King Sejong and the Royal Museum."
59,4.0,"According to various online resources (visitkorea.org, the palace booklet etc. you name it)  Deoksugung Palace was originally belonged to Wolsandaegun (1454~1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469~1494) of the Joseon Dynasty. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575~1641) ascended the throne and gave the palace the name Gyeongungung in 1611. Afterwards, the name was then changed back to its original title of Deoksugung.Visitors can enjoy watching the ceremony of the changing of royal guards at 11:00, 14:00, 15:30. It takes about 10 minutes to finish the show. Personally I prefer the Gyeongbok Palace’s ceremony better as the compound is bigger over there and the result of the pictures taken there came out way nicer. One interesting building within the palace is the Jeonggwanheon Pavilion 정관헌 (靜觀軒). Literally the name means “Palace from which to watch the garden, silently.” — a very zen-like name. This building was renovated and re-opened in 2006. It was the first western style building built in the palace in 1900. Widely known as the King’s Lounge, it is said to be a place for the King Go Jong to enjoy coffee and snacks and hold various banquets here. Influenced by the western culture and lifestyle, Go Jong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his leisure time here. The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary, which still exist today. for more reviews check: http://pheurontay.com/deoksugung-palace-seoul/"

After our lunch we headed to Deoksugung Palace, the tourist spot famous for its stoned-wall road. One of the main building in the palace, the Junghwajeon (Junghwa Hall)  was center of politics which served as the backdrop in times of critical discussions concerning national affairs during the period Great Korean Empire(Daehanjeguk)."
61,3.0,"Here's a complete link to my review. ""II. Deoksugung means ‘Palace of Virtuous Longevity.’ It is actually one of the four main palaces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. If you have been to the other four palaces – Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, and Changgyeonggung, you might feel like there’s no need to visit this place anymore because it may look just the same. But, no! It isn’t! In fact, when I entered the area, I was amazed how perfectly the Traditional Korean palace erect alongside a European structured museum.Since we just had our lunch around the area, we just walked from KTO Headquarters to the palace. However, the fastest and easiest way to get here is through the subway. You have to get off at City Hall (시청역), Exit no. 2.""http://splurk.wordpress.com/2014/05/17/mission-1-trip-to-deoksugung-%EB%8D%95%EC%88%98%EA%B6%81-and-stonewall-walkway-%EB%8F%8C%EB%8B%B4%EA%B8%B8/"
62,3.0,"A beautiful place to sit back and relax, but if you are after Temples and dont have much time in seoul I would not suggest this to be the best out of the lotIts a nice place to have a cold drink and read a book... (this temple is included in the 5 palaces in one ticket)"
63,5.0,"Just across the street from the City Hall Plaza where there are often events being held, this little palace is a must visit while in the area. The park inside is beautiful and the walks around provide a  respite away from the busy city outside of the gates. There is also a changing of the guard ceremony here that is an extra treat to catch."
64,5.0,"Of all the changings of the guard, the one at Deoksugung Palace is the only one that felt personal!  At this location, the changing of the guard is close enough to reach out and touch the guards, you can feel the drumbeat, and you can take photos with them after the ceremony. As a photographer, this allows for some wonderful close-up photos.If you are going to choose one Changing of the Guard ceremony... Deoksugung Palace is the one!!The Palace itself is interesting, but fell third behind Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace for us. One of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty, Deoksugung Palace however is unique, in that it offers the only example of a palace built in western style (Seokjojeon), and the first western style built in Korea. The juxtaposition of ancient, old and the very modern surroundings is fascinating and disconcerting all at once.Well worth the nominal admission price, the best part of our visit to Deoksugung Palace was the Changing-of-the-Guard Ceremony outside the main gates... a free attraction, and one of my favorite in Seoul."
65,4.0,"One of Korea's grand palaces, it's located near City Hall (which probably explains the police presence). The changing of the guards happen at around 11AM and 2PM. Make sure you catch it since it's a treat with men in period costumes performing the ceremony accompanied by martial drums and voice over annotations in Korean and English, so you'll understand what's going on. You don't have to pay the 1000 Won entrance to witness it since it is happening outside the gates. But don't scrimp on the entrance fee as inside is a peaceful and expansive compound housing temples, retainer housing, royal buildings including two Western style buildings that won't be out of place in Europe or Washington DC. There are even replicas of an ancient artillery piece that fires multiple arrows and a water clock shaped like a bell. Lots of photo opportunities in this area and it's not too crowded."
66,5.0,"The palace houses that I visited last September were accessible - one can enter and see some of the exhibits but this time all the houses in the palace ground was out of bounds. 10,000KRW to entetr the palace grounds. The ceremony in front is free though. Last year I missed the changing of the palace guards ceremony so this time I made sure I was there early.  Be sure to check out the time; 11 am, 2 pm and 3:30 pm. I was visiting the Deosugung palace at 10 am but a few guards had already came out then. Once it started at 11 am, it lasted long enough for everyone to take pictures with all the royal guards. There is a make shift tent by the gate where you can put on the Hanbok dress for free and take pictures with the guards.I was at the changing of the palace guards ceremony at the Gwanghamun palace too and I think the Deoksugung one was a more colorful experience with a  guard that looked like a warrior agent answering my friend's question about his role during the Joseon Dynasty. This visit made my day and my week in Seoul."
67,5.0,"Amazing how they keep the tradition. There was a TV/Radio show, photography and paint exhibition that time at the city hall (just across the street), but all eyes on this palace. Awesome thing to watch!"
68,4.0,"the palace is combined with metropolitan city of Seoul, which is located in the center. you can feel like in ancient or Korean dynasty time while you're inside the palace and will meet with very modern city when you at the outside. the palace landscape is very beautiful with colourful Autumn's trees. you can snap so many pictures if you want to while you're here. the architecture of the palace remained the same. there is also guard changing ceremony will be held. anyway, don't forget to pay KRW 1000 for the entrance! ^^"
69,5.0,"There are many palaces in Seoul and unless you are spending a long period of time there, impossible to visit all, so I chose 2 that I thought would have colorful changing of guards ceremonies, and I was not disappointed with Deoksugung.  The Palace is located on the main street of Sejong and more importantly right across the street from Seoul City Hall and Seoul Park.  You can take the number 1 train (green line) or the number 2 train (dark blue line) and get off at the city hall stop.  Take exit 2 or 3 from the station and once thru the turnstiles, look for and elevator.  It will let you off at street level directly in front of the Palace.  Check for the times of the changing of the guards, but they are listed at 11:00, 2:00 and 3:30.  It seems it may be more frequent as I was in that area a number of times for other attractions and it always seemed to be going on.  Position your self more to the left of the entrance as the procession enters from the stoned and brick side street to the left of the Palace, especially if you want to take pics.  I videoed the ceremony with my Ipad, and the pics were great.  This is a must for any visit to Seoul, something that friends and family back home will appreciate.  Not something you see everyday.  The grounds of the Palace are spacious and clean, but looks barren.  The day we visited, the Museum and another building were closed for renovations and there were very few people on the grounds.  There are many trees offering shade if a warm day, and a tea/coffee house toward the back with tables and chairs outside.  It was just peaceful to sit and look around at all the history and culture of Korean royalty.  There are a number of buildings to view although the landscaped grounds were not as beautiful as Gyeongbokgung."
