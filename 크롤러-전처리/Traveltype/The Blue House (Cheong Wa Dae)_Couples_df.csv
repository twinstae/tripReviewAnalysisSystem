0,5.0,"Visited The Blue House (Korean: 청와대; Hanja: 靑瓦臺; Cheong Wa Dae; literally ""pavilion of blue tiles"") is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of South Korea, located in the Jongno district of the capital Seoul.It is painted in blue to show superiority and high ranking of the Korea Government. Lovely architecture and teh “fengsui” of the building is said to be facing the river water and behind is the mountain for good “Fengshui”.☺️☺️"
1,4.0,"The blue house is the official residence of the President of South Korea and is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is tightly guarded and you can view the Blue house from across the road. The building offers a nice photo opportunity with the mountain at the background. During some days, a tour of the gardens of the house is available (no entry into the building)."
2,2.0,"booking in advance is required (foc). seriously nothing much at all. u get a mug as door gift. you will just be briefed that this and that buildings are for what purpose, holding what events. nothing else."
3,3.0,"Needs to book in advance, and always fully booked from the website. It might be fun for the local, but not so interesting to the foreigners. Overall, it's a walking tour, not much to see. The souvenir is a good surprise."
4,3.0,Just a walk around the area as I believe it’s not meant to be a tourist spot where one can freely enter the compound. Anyway we were here as one of the itinerary for our tour. Took some pictures outside it and that’s about all.
5,4.0,"This is a working Korean presidential residence. Located North from the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We were not aware that one can make a special inside tour reservations online. So, do it. I am sure it is worth it. Otherwise, you will just take pictures from the outside."
6,3.0,"I booked the tour to Cheong Wa Dae out of curiousity especially since the Blue House is located right next to the east gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Both places are located right at the foot of Mount Bugaksan. I had a lot of expectation for this tour especially since it's the presidential house. I thought they'd cancel the tour especially with the impeachment of the former President Park Geun-hye.We went to the tour information booth outside of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. We had our passports and reservation checked by the Chong Wa Dae staff. Once they gave an all-clear, we boarded the shuttle bus that would take us to the Blue House. Somehow the shuttle bus reminded me of the karaoke bus filled with ahjumma in some Korean TV dramas, especially with the colourful lights inside. You may also recognise this in Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" music video.When we arrived, we had to undergo a security check. Hubby's backpack was an abyss so it was really messy and he had to take out everything one by one. Our passports were swapped with an audio guide and lanyard. We were also given a souvenir from Cheong Wa Dae and a laminated brochure with a brief explanationof the areas. We were briefed about the presidential house at the Public Information Hall and were re-informed that we could only take photos at 3 out of 6 main places that we visited.At Nok Ji Won, the successor of the previous president would usually plant a tree to commemorate their era of reign. The oldest tree there was about 310 years old. I almost took a photo right away but was told by one of the guards to wait until the guide told us so *phew*. Every tourist will have photos of this since we could only take photos with the large tree as the background.This was the highlight of the tour itself especially to be able to see the Blue House. We couldn't get closer to it though. I assumed the former President Park Geun-hye was under house arrest there... hahaha :-). The Blue House has 150,000 handmade ceramic blue coloured roof tiles and behind it is the Bugaksan Mountain.The building to the right of the Blue House was dedicated to Admiral Yi Sun-sin while the one on the left was dedicated to King Sejong the Great. Both buildings are usually used for meetings.The last building that we were shown was the State Reception House. All of the white pillars at the bottow floor were created from one single stone. This is the place where the president holds the reception to welcome international guests. Only the guests are allowed to walk in from the front door.There was an additional tour to see Chil Gung that we joined in. Chil Gung complex consists of five shrines where each shrine was dedicated to a concubine who gave birth to a future king in the Joseon era.I felt the Blue House tour was quite short and it was unfortunate that we could only take photos at some areas. If you have extra time in Seoul and would like to see the inside of the Presidential Complex, then I'd advise you to book the tour in advance. If you're short of time, this is one of the tours that you can remove from your itinerary."
7,4.0,they check your passport a lot to enter the tour and to continue.  tour moves a bit slow as you are waiting to proceed many times.  at the end of the tour you walk out the gate and there is no one to help get to the tour bus. that was uncomfortable.  however I enjoyed the tour and it as very imformative
8,4.0,There was not much to see since the tour was only restricted to some places inside the compound. Non-korean speaking guests were given a gadget which would help you throughout the tour and the significance of the stops. Photos were also restricted to certain parts. Please remember if you want to join the tour you have to register online before your visit.
9,5.0,We weren't actually able to stop and take pictures. We drove though on a tour bus. It's amazing how close we got to the presidential home. Hopefully I got some good pictures.
10,4.0,"So glad we got to see this! It is visible from the main palace in Seoul, and it's got the most amazing backdrop of the mountain behind it. Worth seeing for sure."
11,3.0,"The official tour of Cheong Wa Dae ""The Blue House"" (ROK's version of the US White House) was in fact only a very limited and quick tour of some of the grounds, with limited opportunity for photographs, with a large school group, and a guide who spoke only Korean and whose narrative did not remotely match that of the free headset given for translation. In fact, sometimes the tour guide would speak for 2 minutes and start moving the group, while the information in my headset would take several minutes and would be continuing while the herd was moved along. Sadly, I feel like I really didn't learn much about the Blue House, Korean politics or government. These kinds of locations fascinate me, and could have been really interesting.The police officers were more friendly and interactive (though entirely professional and vigilant) than our tour guide.This tour could be so much more with some easy fixes.1. Ensure that those using a headset for another language are told when to start playing a particular number so they know what is going on.2. Include group directions in the audio program, along with the description of the area. (e.g., It is now ok to take photos, or You can only shoot photos in this direction.)3. Greater match between the tour guide narrative and the headset narrative. My native Korean companion said the match was limited at best.4. If it is an ""English tour"" it would be nice to have someone there who speaks English to answer questions. Fortunately, my companion could ask and translate for me.5. Be clear up front that the tour will go nowhere near entering the Blue House.The best part of the tour was when a special guide was assigned to take the 4 English speakers in the group to the shrine next door. She was friendly, knowledgeable and very informative. This part of the tour was everything the earlier portion had not been.I truly hope the organizers of the Blue House tour will work to improve what could be a terrific tour of one of the major sites of Korean politics.If you plan to go, plan in advance. You will need reservations and must carry your passport (or Korean ID) with you."
12,4.0,"Behind Cheong Wa Dae is in a very beautiful mountain scene. Although we were not able to get in (but we enjoy to walk around the beautiful garden) and only allowed to take pictures in some certain spots, and take pictures of the Blue House from a certain distance, it is still a very beautiful pictures : a very beautiful mountain behind as a background, Cheong Wa Dae in the middle, both sides and front garden are surrounding with a lot of flowers and trees. If you are first time visit Korea, it is worth to drop by to see the landmark as the president office and house although cannot get in."
13,3.0,The tour needs to be reserved well in advance.  The amount of time waiting for previous groups to go through and the security check exceeded the tour time which was barely 30 minutes.  You see the immaculately kept lawn and a closer look at the buildings (which can be seen from the outside).  Really wasn't worth the hassle and shouldn't be a priority if you're visiting from abroad.  All explanations are in Korean but they give audio guides to non-Koreans.  You also get a nice souvenir.
14,3.0,Nothing much to see. The only thing you notice is that it has good fenshui cos there is a mountain behind the blue house.If you are on a tour bus the bus will need to drop you off from quite some distance away due to security reasons.
