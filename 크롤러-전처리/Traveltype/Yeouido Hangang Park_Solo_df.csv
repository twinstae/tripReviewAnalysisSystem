0,5.0,"This park is the best place to enjoy the view of Seoul along the Han-River. There are less facilities than Banpo area. But you who use public transportation can arrive this park easier than that and many skyscrapers with lights also makes you feel good(of course, you can have fun with using food delivery service).고층 건물들에 의한 야경이 이곳을 다른 한강공원에 비해 보다 매력적인 곳으로 만든다고 생각합니다. 다만 반포 한강공원에 비해 전반적인 구성은 알차지 않다는 느낌이 듭니다."
1,4.0,"Hangang Park comes alive weekends in Summer. Thousands of families with shelters and picnic blankets enjoying the free water park. Water is cold, but the kids don't seem to care. There are a couple of convenience stores within the park to provide access to cold drinks and snacks. Great spot to take kids for a couple of hours on a hot afternoon. Good views of the city and bridges over the Han River. Plenty of cycling and walking tracks."
2,5.0,"I would mainly tell people to get off at yeouinaru station, exit 1, to enjoy hangang park. It's right next to the river and has so many food trucks during the summer time. You could just grab a meal and a few beverages and sit there peacefully as long as you want. Try to go when the sun is setting so that the temperature will be cooler. This has been one of my favorite summer spots and I try to go every weekend during the summer to enjoy the area, people, and food."
3,4.0,"It is nice to come and just relax here with a nice book! You can also rent a bike here too, by the hours."
4,4.0,"It's a very nice place for picnic with friends, family or love ones. It's a good place to feel like ""Korean"" / local. On weekend, it will be very crowded. But all of the facilities are fully provided. You can rent the mat and tent for sitting and enjoy your picnic, rent the bicycles to ride around the area, buying food/ snacks. They also provide the clean toilets as well. You can see the nice scenery of Han river. It's better to arrive around late afternoon and spend time until the early night."
5,4.0,"This park is near my house-It is a very nice park to walk around- There isn't much though. Some stores and bicycle rental.But I just love the empty space. It is very nice to walk around.Sometimes, they have demonstrations here and that is not good.Other times, it can get crowded when everyone decides to come to the park.However, most of the times, it is quite empty, which I enjoy a lot.It is a nice walk to IFC and back.The only drawback is that you should not walk in the hot summer or extremely cold winter.Don't do it. I did it and I regretted it :(Overall, a very nice park :D"
6,5.0,"I came here in 2015 during the spring and there were cherry blossoms everywhere.  The park itself is beautifully located along the Han River and a nice spot to spend some time enjoying yourself or with friends/family.  I loved the area so much that the next time I come (spring 2019), I have planned to stay at the Conrad Seoul to have a view and be in walking distance. Highly recommend."
7,4.0,"Great place for a short, moderate or long riverside walk.  Popular summer evening location for Seouls residents, many relaxing in pop-up tents eating meals. Can rent bicycles. Close to International Finance Centre (IFC)."
8,4.0,Nice park with enjoyable activities. Easy to access by public transport. Better to visit on a warm day.
9,5.0,"I have been able to be in summer and, winter and this park is beautiful in bouth seasons. Can get really windy in winter and is really busy during the weekends in the summer time. You have de view of the 63 building. And some hotels. People like to go during the summer and bring their tent and be there during the day with they family or friends. Is a lot of events during the summer time so check out what is going on during the weekends is a,lot less busy in the autumn/ winter. You can rent bicycles and go around the park. Or go for a run, in weekends is a lot of people walking, hogging, running is really beutiful."
10,4.0,Great long straight location for a bike ride near the river. Lots of side for walking or running too. Gives good views of the bridges.  Can connect to Seoul Forest
11,5.0,Whilst I did not go up the 122 storey building I found the architecture very stunning. The space around made a gun place to visit.
12,5.0,"Got a snack and sat down by the park area with the local ajusis and ajumas. Walked for two hours and flowers everywhere. Most cherry blossom to see, among all locations I went to in Seoul. 👍🏼"
13,4.0,"Take the metro and walk a couple a minutes and you'll be there. It's lovely to see the river and all the cherry blossoms, but make sure to visit when it isn't overly crowded with people. If wanting to see it at it fullest then having sunshine and clear vision is a must."
14,4.0,Went here just last week and I can say that this is a good place to chill and relax. Nearby food establishments where you can purchase food for picnic or you may bring your own. Bicycle lanes available in case you decide to ride your bike. Not sure if there is a place where you can rent one though since I didn't see any when I went there.
15,3.0,"A vast open space with hardly anyone there. Well it was a chilly day in winter, looking at the reviews summer is when it all happens."
16,5.0,"Went here twice, once in Summer and once in Winter. Enjoyed the trip in Summer way more so we got to cycle, picnic and play with water the whole afternoon! The cycling track is amazing especially during sun set. The view was spectacular and will definitely revisit this place every time I go to Seoul. Extremely relaxing!"
17,5.0,"Especially in summer this is a really good place to visit. The atmosphere is pretty nice, it is not as rushed as other parts of Seoul and you have a beautiful view on the Han river and it surroundings. As a result of the food trucks you can also still be there for dinner, though, since it can be busy it can take a while to get food. Overal a must when visiting Seoul"
18,4.0,"I went there at evening, and there are many people having night picnic there. It was surprisingly crowded there. It a very good place to chill out with friends."
19,4.0,"I went here during Spring time and it's nice to see some Spring flowers in the area. You can just sit here to relax, have a picnic or do a bike stroll. It also has a good view of the Hangang river and the long bridge. This place is accessible from the train station."
20,4.0,"As soon as you get off from the Yeouinaru metro station and walk towards the Yeouido Hangang Park by the Han River, you will see Seoul's tallest building - 63 Plaza. Takes about 15 min walk. Among the attraction is 63 Art Museum and Observatory. You will have a fabulous night view of Seoul and the Han River."
21,5.0,"Though i didn'T intend going to this park, but the promenade fascinated me and i needed to have a look. If i would have more time i would have walked around the river or just sit down there and enjoy the great view over the city."
22,5.0,"Whenever I feel tired about urban life, I always go to Han river park. Just wandering around the park, watching the massive pillars which support bridges. I use this place as my sanctuary."
23,5.0,"First of all, if you ask ""hangang park"" to Korean, they'll ask you back, ""which hangang park?"" Because hangang is a very long river and there are tons of parks all the way.Yeuido Hangang Park is one of the hangang parks you should visit. There's a cruise service that gives different themes at night, regular service at noon. The lights along the park are beautiful!So many people had picnics or cycling along the park."
24,5.0,"A very nice park with lots of little activities to do! I was so happy when I came across this park, it was a nice break from the city. It's quite large and spans the length of the Yeouido island. There was a shallow pool which looked like a lot of fun (so remember to bring swimming clothes!). Bikes, tandem bikes, and Segues are available to rent. You could easily spend half a day or a whole day here. Views were amazing. Great for people watching, photography, and any outdoor activity."
25,4.0,"Took the metro and got off here for my river cruise. It is very interesting to see how Koreans esp young ones spend their Saturday night. They're having picnic with their friends and families. Lots of children playing around, drinking, laughter on the background,performances by a live band, food stalls everywhere...it's just fun to see. One can go strolling in the big park or ride a bike. It's good for the family and even for a solo traveler like me."
26,4.0,"I spent 1-2 hours for just a little bit of nature to enjoy on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I bought some food from the convenience store inside it and picked a spot to eat it in peace. there were families with kids riding bikes and even those ubiquitous ""couple-bikes""."
27,4.0,Went there during the Spring Flower Festivals and loads of families and couples were seen there along with great food from street vendors and also flower booths. Good view of the Hangang and would be nice for cycling and picnics. Loads of seagulls though so beware!
28,5.0,"if you wanna escape from your hurry life, you must visit this park, where you could enjoy the scenery from the Hangang River, and rent a bike to ride along the river where you will have a great moment, and impressive scenery in your mind!"
29,5.0,"I don`t think I can ever be tired of this place. No matter the season, no matter the weather, I just love walking there, or just have a coffee. I once missed my last train, just because I was enjoying the night view..."
30,5.0,"Looking for a riverside stroll / The Yeuido hanggang park is a good option, as the =Hanggang river banks is filled with parks to stroll on , bike around , lounge around , picnic in. I like this particular park specially in spring during Cherry blossoms ! Just perfect !"
31,5.0,"This park is so famous with beautiful view. I like to walk or take a bicycle in this park especially before 6 p.m. because sometimes it is crowded after 6 p.m. But mostly this place is so quiet and enjoyable before 6 p.m. Several years ago, Seoul city reconstructed this park and after that, this place is so clean and nice to walk(You can rent bicycles at some places). It has many convenience stores, cafes and restaurants(mostly fried chicken and beer) but this place is huge so in not famous part, maybe you have to walk to find those. Seoul citizens like this place and I recommend this place for visitors, too."
32,4.0,"Extremely crowded place, but still you can enjoy. Hiking, riding a bike, and picnic are available, and you can drink some alcohol too."
33,3.0,"Hangang Park was constructed on reclaimed land on the shores of the Han River and is easily accessed on Metro line 5 from Yeouinaru station.  Compared to the leafier and more scenic Yeouido Park nearby, Hangang Park is rather sparse with open grassy sections and long walking paths.  Trees, where present, are fairly few and far apart.  However, this layout gives the park unlimited views of the Han River.  It's popular for walks and with skateboarders who come to practice their flips and tricks.  Another reason to come here is that the pier for the Han River sightseeing ferries are located about 300-400 meters away from the Meto station."
34,3.0,"While the park is awesome when there are activities or festivals (fairly frequent) going on, its not worth a special trip if you're visiting Seoul."
35,5.0,"another landmark of seoul, very beautiful and many korean are here. this is a very good place for relaxing, exercise, cycling and picnic. rent a biscycle is around 3000 krw per hour."
36,5.0,"I walked to this park from Yeouido Park - and was impressed by the size of this park. Overlooking Hangang, you can go for a stroll, rent a bicycle, have a picnic, or simply sit anywhere in the park to admire the gorgeous city view and Gangbuk from this side of the city. With a good weather, I can only imagine how lovely it would be walking from one end to the other in this park at night - that will be in my list during my next visit for sure! :)It's near to subway stations (Yeouinaru and Yeouido stations), cafes, stalls. Super clean."
37,5.0,"There is some cherry blossom inside the park, but there is a long long cherry blossom street just next to the KBS building, this is great for photo taking"
38,3.0,Probably the most well-known place to see cherry blossoms in the spring in Korea; not sure if it's the best.  Crowds are overbearing as all of Seoul comes there within those couple weeks.  Other than that there is nothing special about the park.
39,5.0,"A lovely park with gorgeous scenery. The park itself is clean and spacious. It's a great place for gathering, resting, relaxing or perhaps everything! There is a huge water pool and a fountain in the middle of the park, and everyone is welcome to have fun in the water. It's just amazing. A stroll along the park not only brought you the beautiful scenery of Han River but also the picture of how it's like to live in Seoul. It's just so vibrant and lovely. Do visit the park in the evening and come back at nighttime as well. The sunset and the night scene are just amazing. I will certainly come back when i visit Seoul again."
