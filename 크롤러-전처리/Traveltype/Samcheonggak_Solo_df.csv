0,5.0,"I decided to take the bus to get to this place on a very early Saturday morning.  Just a one bus transfer from Gangnam.  There is actually a shuttle service, however, I was not sure of the actual location of the pick-up points.  Its best to have a wifi cause google maps can lead you up the hill.  When you get off the end of the line for the 2nd bus, its an uphill climb of around 15-20 minutes.  Its a residential area with narrow side walks.  Mid-point of the hike, there is a bakery and a Japanese restaurant.  I had coffee at the bakery on the way down.  Both were still close at around 9AM.  The grounds of the place has various activities that can be booked in advance to experience Korean culture.  Since it was so early in the day, I had a peaceful stroll and opportunity to take pictures.  The site facilities where also still close. But the hike was well worth it."
