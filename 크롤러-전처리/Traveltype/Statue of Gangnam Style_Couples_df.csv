0,5.0,The statue is by the road outside COEX. We were surprised that there were so few people. Maybe Psy has gone out of style...

2,5.0,"We were so happy to find this, they even have the youtube track that you can play and dance along! Great statue and tribute."
3,3.0,Not much to see but visit if you're at the COEX mall - take one of the East exits of the mall. Saw quite a few people having a little dance and photo ops and we couldn't resist ourselves! It's lit up at night too.
4,4.0,"The statue is in the front of the COEX East Gate and represents two overlapping fists, the popular “horse-riding” dance move from PSY’s song “Gangnam Style”. From a bird’s-eye view, it looks like two hands embracing the Earth."
