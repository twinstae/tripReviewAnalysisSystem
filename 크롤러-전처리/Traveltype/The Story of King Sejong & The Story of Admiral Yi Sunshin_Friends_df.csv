The museums are below street level and are connected to one another.  Here you can learn about the Korean alphabet and writing as well as the war history. There are small activity tables where you can do many activities such as standing and learning Korean calligraphy.  There is no charge for this Museum."

As a New Yorker I could really appreciate the bustling crowds and the contrast of natural beauty, with historical architecture at every bend. We decided to visit the King’s monument after meandering about Gyeongbokgung Palace and I was absolutely delighted! Not only could we escape the heat but there were all sorts of lovely exhibits and a really cool interactive sundial display... we took photos on some of these fantastic benches made from words but we have no idea what they say! If anyone knows please find me on IG @ KolaCares and say hi lol. Can’t wait to go back- I pray for peace in politics because this lovely, civilized city deserves to be preserved (just beware the “disregard” for lack of personal space lol, Korean certainly do crowd too much.)"
2,5.0,The monuments above the memorial museums are beautiful. Below them you will find the memorial museums. The entrance is on the side with the King Sejong statue.  Both museums offer informative information on the two individuals in Korean history. On King Sejong's side of the museum there is a replica of a throne that you can sit on for pictures and on the Admiral's side you will find a replica of a ship. There are also lots of places within the museum for picture taking.

This is not a only good thing of this museum. You can see and hear about great Korean history, General Yi and King Sejong. 4D Cinema is also free, after that you can write your name in Korean letter by traditional way. On weekend, there are so many kids, so I recommend on weekdays."
4,4.0,We went down just for the King Sejong's museum but Admiral Yi's museum was also there. That was awesome! I prefer Admiral Yi place than Sejong's. Quite well made to show how he commanded his navy during the war. It is a must to see if you are at Gwanghwamun.
