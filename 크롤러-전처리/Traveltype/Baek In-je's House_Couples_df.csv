We walked up the hill and eventually found it - a quiet oasis.It really gave us an insight into the buildings we had seen in the Hanok village. The signs are in English setting out the history of both this and similar houses."

Turned out to be the best consequence of a bathroom-search:)Located up a side road, it's almost devoid of tourists. Walking around the Baek In-Je House, I could imagine how the rich lived in privilege a long time ago. There are English translations so it's easy to understand."
2,5.0,Well worth a visit if you are in the bukchon area.  This house museum is free and gives you a look into how life was like for the Korean elite in the past. This is a real house that has been converted to a museum. It is in the middle of other old historical houses that people still live in.  A very worthwhile visit.
