0,4.0,"I enjoyed my visit.  The goods are grouped in designated areas, but all that interested me were the antiques.  I surprisingly found several items I would buy under other circumstances.  My limitations, concerning fragile items were 2 packings and 3 flights in the coming days.  I chose not to take the chance.  To give a small indication of what can be found, while still in the market I sent several photos to a friend who collects antique clocks. His response was a big envious “wow”!As noted, I skipped most of the areas, and essentially stayed in the antiques area, plus spent some time outside where there are more vendors.  I estimate that I was there a little more than an hour and a half."
1,3.0,Wasn't impressed with anything here other than seeing the market in its entirety- it is huge - lines a lot of streets. There are some food stalls so you won't go hungry. There were a couple of items I liked but couldn't get them on an aeroplanes.Just an interesting thing to see.
2,1.0,"I went here expecting a real craft experience, there was only one crafts stall. The rest was a glorified garage sale with everything was a real muddle. Only highlight was a delicious pancake at the upstairs food court. Needs better sorting and more crafts like it advertises. Disappointing place, could be so much better!"
3,3.0,"Such a contrast to the shopping malls of Seoul.  Mostly vintage, aka used, clothes.  Some street food, nothing too tasty (I love street food).  Most of the stuff is of low quality and cheap.  It’s still worth a walk through."
4,2.0,I was there at eleven o'clock in the morning and most of the shops were not opened yet. There was an unpleasant smell in the market.
