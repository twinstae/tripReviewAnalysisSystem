0,3.0,"My friend and I stopped by here while touring the larger Hongdae area.  It's an interesting place to visit as an American because it's an open-air shopping mall.  It also has a nice aesthetic (as evidenced by the colorful umbrellas shown in the picture above, as well as the small gardens and plants throughout the mall.  It was surprisingly calm and uncrowded on the Saturday afternoon when we visited.  Not worth a trip to for its own sake, but certainly a nice stopover if you're in the area doing other things and need some shade, a bathroom, or just a place to sit for a little."

The place is built in style of a maze so you might get lost moving up and down, but after a while you'll be used to the place. The Umbrella Roof is cute"
