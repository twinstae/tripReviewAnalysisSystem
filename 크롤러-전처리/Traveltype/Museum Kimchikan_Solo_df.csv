0,5.0,"I don’t understand why this place doesn’t have higher ratings.Tucked away at the 4th floor of a hidden building in Insadong area, this Kimchi museum is in the vicinity of very chill artsy vibe. I signed up for the Kimchi making class and it was really fun to make your own kimchi with the various ingredients such as plum sauce, garlic, ginger, anchovies sauce provided. You even get to bring your kimchi creation home! The exhibits, though not very extensive, were obviously done with a lot of love and gives the visitor a comprehensive guide to Korea’s favourite export. I spent a very lovely afternoon there and wished I could have stayed longer. There is even a tasting room for us to taste kimchi! Overall it was a very memorable experience for me, and I highly recommend anyone who visits Korea to go."
1,4.0,It takes about 60 minutes to see this museum. Some nice interactive displays; audio guide is free with admission. Highlight is the kimchi tasting section on the 6th floor. I wish I'd come sooner: this place demystifies kimchi significantly. Check the website for classes - asvance registration required. A fun and free extra is the traditional Korean garb available to borrow during your tour for epic selfies. It is really hard to find: don't give up!
2,4.0,"Kimchi is an integral part of Korean cuisine so having a chance to learn how to make it helps you understand the culture a little better. Plus, it's fun! I did the white cabbage kimchi class. All your ingredients are laid out when you arrive. First, you watch their chef make the kimchi and then you try for yourself. It's pretty easy but just remember you need to let them kimchi ferment in your fridge for a few days before you eat it! If possible, plan to do the class at the beginning of your trip so you can eat the kimchi you made. The staff was very helpful and spoke good English."
3,3.0,"It is not fun place to visit as a Native Korean. I know a lot about process of making Kimchi. But for the foreigners, it might be interesting. The good point is that you can enjoy Kimchi at the end. This museum moved to other town."
4,3.0,The museum is quite small and took me about 15-20minutes to finish looking at the exhibits. You can find out about the history and different types of kimchi. There is also a tasting room for some common types of kimchi.In my opinion it's not a must-go museum given its size and corresponding entrance fee.
