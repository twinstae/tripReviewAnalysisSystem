0,5.0,"My colleague and I took a group of 18 people here comprised of 15 college students and two other professors from TN. I can say without a doubt, this was a major highlight of our three-week experience. The percussion music was amazing, the delivery phenomenal, and the comedic action truly entertaining. Good job Nanta!!"
1,5.0,"A very funny show, you do not need Korean to understand, it is for everyone! The timing of the performers is spot on. I didn't know what to expect, but loved the entire performance. I will go again."
2,5.0,"It’s a lively, funny, creative and dazzling performance. I laughed so much I was in tears. It was superb. it reminded me of the blue man group. highly recommended if you are in Seoul and outside the theatre is the myeongdong food stalls and shopping. Go!!"
3,4.0,if you have seen STOMP then you have seen NANTA.  Simple plot with some pretty funny parts.  Drums Drums Drums and Food Food Food.  Dont sit up front unless you want to be pulled on stage.  Pretty much every single seat is a good seat.  I sat on the last row and its only about 50 feet from the stage.
4,5.0,This show was funny and interactive! I would go again! This is my number one recommendation. We couldn’t take pics so I don’t have much to share. I think it would be even cooler if we got to eat the food the prepared.
