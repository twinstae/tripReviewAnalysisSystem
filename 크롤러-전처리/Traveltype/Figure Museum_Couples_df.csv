0,5.0,"A must for anyone interested in superhero, action & anime figures. A short walk from the subway & you spot the transformer figure outside. Be a geek & press the door opener to enter, it starts your journey for you. The staff were friendly & welcoming. Start at the 5th floor & work your way down. The top floor has a great display of Star Wars figures. A wall displays DC, Marvel & movie superheros - linked to an interactive display which gives details of each figure - lots of information in English.The next floor has lots more Marvel & DC & movie figuresNote - you can take pictures of anything.Next floor has anime figures - lots of Japanese anime Then Dragonball Z figuresThere is a shop then can access a lower floor with Marvel & Spiderman figuresNot the cheapest museum but use your Discover Seoul pass for this option. We found lots of figures that couldn't get to purchase in the UK.A must if you love the classic adult graphic novels & superhero movies"
1,4.0,My husband and father in law had the best time there. It’s like there’s a surprise on each floor they visited. It was properly maintained (it even smells good there haha). We went there on a Thursday and it wasn’t crowded. Easy to find via Google Maps. The toys they sold at the ground floor were a bit expensive but we bought some as souvenirs.
