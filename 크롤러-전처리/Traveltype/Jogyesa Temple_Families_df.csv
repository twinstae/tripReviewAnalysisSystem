0,5.0,"Really beautifully Tempel with lot of flower work in the courtyard. Impressing contrast of old temples with modern high rise buildings in the surrounding.Not much time needed here, but worth a stop for 15 to 20 minutes"
1,5.0,I am a Christian but I could not help visiting this wonderful Temple.  Buddhists are very friendly people.  Everyone should explore culture and visit this Temple.
2,5.0,"The temple is very important for Korea, and has a long, and complicated, history in Seoul. Active and interesting."
3,3.0,"We visited on a Monday, when the museum is closed. The temple is worth seeing, and it's in central Seoul near the main palace and the US Embassy. But without a guide, it was hard to understand what was what between the different buildings. It was hard to find a pamphlet in English (though there is a pavilion we eventually found that had a little brochure in English).  Beautiful temple, but it was not the highlight of our visit because we didn't learn as much as other places we went."
4,5.0,The Buddhist temple was amazing!  It's incredible how well the grounds were kept and we even got to see the monks conducting a service.
5,5.0,"Great time viewing the temple rooms, making crafts, traditional Korean soy flour cookies and sharing tea/experiences with one of the nuns."
6,4.0,"Easy to find Buddhist temple. Piece of quiet on busy world. Friendly monks. If you are there during the working day is quiet  but when monks are meditating start to be quiet crowded. Nice and colourful. Monks are offering to stay with them for one day, but this need to be booked separately in advance by the temple website. Web is also available in English. Nice place to visit also with young children."
7,5.0,Got by chance to visit Temple art shop where to decorate lotus flowers. the place is nicely peaceful and free tea time.
8,4.0,"Considered as the most important temple of Korean Buddhism, this temple hosts many religious ceremonies, rituals all over the year including the Lantern festival. There is a huge praying hall, where anyone can pray, and one can see lot of local population visiting and praying. The temple complex also has a small garden.This temple is right in the heart of the city and can be clubbed with visit to Buckchon Hanok Village or G Palace."
9,5.0,Temple with big golden Buddha statue. But the best part of this temple are the flowers! The colourful flowers are beautifully arranged around the temple.
10,5.0,We fit a visit in to see this after visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village nearby.  The floral arrangements and sculpted hedges of elephants and dragons were unexpected. Seeing all the worshippers praying to three massive Buddhas is awe inspiring.
11,5.0,"I was really amazed by this place. It was my first time seeing such huge buddha statues, it was very imposing and majestic. We enjoyed it so much that we went two times during our trip. The first time we arrived at an hour which was filled with people in the terrace, on their knees, praying, hearing the monk speak over the microphone. Watching them being so devote and praying and ... it was just an amazing thing to see. The second time we went it was emptier, but still some people praying inside. We stayed outside - for respect- and had time to meditate and to take it all in. A must."
12,3.0,"Part of a group tour. A quite typical temple. nice lotus flowers. We visited this place in a very hot day. With kids. I would say, not for kids."
13,5.0,Instagram worthy as there are so many great visuals here if the temple is not interesting to you. We loved it all and stayed for an hour when it is about 5-10 min type of visit
14,5.0,"This was a breath of fresh air in the touristy district of Insadong. Stepping into the grounds, you are greeted by a profusion of lotus flowers. We were there during prayer time, so we did not go inside the main temple but stood outside, looking in and touring the grounds. Wish we could have seen the Buddhas up close. This is a pretty peaceful, refreshing spot in the middle of a busy city.There are a lot of pictorial opportunities here - from the statues to the flowers to the temple architecture and colorful grounds. Would love to see this place during the Lantern Festival. What a beautiful place!"
15,5.0,"when we visited prayers were going on, it seems some renovation is  going on too. it is not a huge temple but still loved it.  very beautiful"
16,3.0,"There are certainly better temples to see in Seoul.  I thought it was interesting, but overall a waste of time to see."
17,5.0,Even when it is restorations across the place it is a wonderful place to meet locals praying so you can get a reference how one of the main religions behave.
18,5.0,My family and I were fortunate enough to visit the Jogyesa Temple while a Buddhist service was going on.  Both the Temple and the service were beautiful and inspiring.  One the most interesting things to do in Seoul and potentially the most spiritual (if you happen to catch it during a service).
19,4.0,Jogyesa temple was the only temple we visited in Seoul as it was close to our hotel. The temple was being prepared for the upcoming Buddha's birthday celebration with lot of colourful lanterns. There were lot of local worshippers inside the temple. Its worth a short visit.
20,3.0,Jogyesa temple is an interesting place to visit as the colourful lanterns will make wonderful pictures.
21,5.0,This gem of Buddhist history is centrally located in Seoul and is close to many other attractions. The best time is to go just before or during Buddha's birthday when the temple is festooned with colorful lanterns.
22,4.0,"This is the headquarters of Jogyejong which is one branch of Korean Buddhism.The main hall is really big. But, other areas aren't much. Place for Buddhists rather than tourists.- The accessibility is quite nice unlike most other mountain-area temples of Korea. Walkable distance from metro line #5 Gwanghwamun and line #3 Anguk. Taking a look for about half an hour will be okay for tourists.- 4 guardians at the gate are made of steel and each one weighs 1 ton. Good to take a look.- There are huge trees, souvenir shops, the main hall, praying rooms, a museum, etc.- There's the first-ever post office of Korea locating nearby which is currently a museum.- Across the street, there's the temple stay office where visitors can get help."
23,4.0,"A nice experience with my son, an interesting arcitechture, history and religuous place. Interesting with all the People inside praying and study budism. I my reach the first grade of Nirvana :) it is Worth a visit :)"
24,4.0,"If you are passing by, pop in - I wouldn't travel hours to see it.There is a nice vibe and no-one minds tourists being here."
25,5.0,"I saw colourful flowers, monkey king and Korean traditional roof, so jumped out of the bus without knowing what this place was. What a nice surprise! There were huge 3 golden budah, tower... small crowded place with many people praying for their children (heard about a National University Entrance Exam in few weeks). But I enjoyed colourful flowers, decorated cartoon characters, beautiful Korean traditional buildings. Very close to InSa-dong and Palaces in central Seoul. It is free."
26,5.0,"The temple itself was beautiful and gives you a glimpse of the religious of South Korea but during the Chrysanthemum festival, it looks even more beautiful. Tons and tons of different shades of chrysanthemums are made into different shapes and characters to create a beautiful display.  There was so much to see and so many things to take pictures of. If youre planning to come to Korea in autumn, definitely dont miss this temple especially when the flowers are setup already"
27,5.0,Very picturesque!  Architecture is quite impressive.  This is an active  temple where you can see monks and worshipers praying.
28,5.0,"A temple in the middle of the city, surrounded by all busy streets. As soon as you go inside, it is a different world with peace and calm enviornment. Magnifient building with beutiful flowers around the temple."
29,4.0,Smack dab in the bustling city of Seoul is this beautiful temple - the headquarters for all temples around Korea. Despite its location and the crowds there's this serenity... the lotus garden is absolutely gorgeous... i could have just spent hours just sitting there and watching the people come to pray and worship...
30,5.0,you need to visit here if you like statues or budhas. we went all over the grounds and loved the statues.
31,4.0,My first visit to Jogyesa Temple in Seoul.You need to take a little walk to get to this temple if you are going by skytrain.A very special temple with lantern all over the place.There are alot of activities in the temple such as charity event and music performance for tourist as well.
32,5.0,We happened upon this Buddhist Temple by accident. Our youngest son had said if we had the chance we should visit this location.  We had been wandering around the centre of Seoul when we were attracted by the beautiful colours of the lanterns.
33,4.0,Beautiful Buddhist temple in the middle of the city. Some nice buildings and very interesting statues and surroundings. We were during Buddha's birthday celebration during the day and in the evening. It was magnificent with hundred of lanterns around.
34,4.0,"A must see for any visitor to Korea,it has along history,it was established in 1395,a symbol of Korean Buddhism.At the entrance  to the temple there are a lot of colorful flags,quite a spectacular  sight."
35,5.0,"There are trees over 500 yrs. old on the compound.  Open around the clock, get off at Jonggak Station and exit 2.While there ring the huge ancient bell and take advantage of the opportunity to put on a korean traditional costume (men and women) for free and take great photos!"
36,4.0,Nice relaxing temple a stone's throw away from Insadong. I decided to make a short detour since I was visiting Insadong area. Nice quite corner in the city to visit.
37,3.0,Its relatively small but it is well located in between tall skyscrapers and offers a different perspective on bustling Seoul
38,5.0,"If you have the opportunity to travel to South Korea visit this temple, everything in South Korea is very interesting, but visiting a temple is a nice experience"
39,3.0,วันที่ไป เป็นกลางเดือนตุลาคม มีเทศกาลดอกไม้ พอดี มีการจัดประดับ ตกแต่ง สถานที่ สวยงามมาก แต่มีผู้ที่ไปสวดมนต์อยู่หน้าพระพุทธรูปด้านใน จึงเข้าไม่ได้ This temple is small but settle in middle of town beautiful and sublime
40,5.0,"I am really glad I stopped at Jogyesa Temple. The grounds surrounding it are beautiful, offering water scenes, plants, trees (one of them is 500 years old,) canopies of lanterns, and beautiful architecture. While not a quiet attraction necessarily, it was very peaceful and tranquil. The temple is a great spot in the city to take a break from the cars and mass transit, and gather your thoughts. I would recommend this to anybody seeking to learn more about Buddhism, or somebody who just appreciates beauty in nature and architecture.The help desk was staffed by kind, knowledgeable people. They were quick to answer my questions, and were very happy that we signed a guest book.One thing to note, I added this temple to my Google maps, and ended up at a post office museum instead. Not a problem, the temple is just a block or so farther down the road. So if you find yourself at a post office museum, keep walking (or walk back, I don't know the direction from where you came.)"
41,5.0,"We were able to visit this temple during the celebration of Buhddas birthday.  There was a program with music, dance and activities.   The lanterns were amazing"
42,5.0,It's a very nice temple. Not a very big place but the beautiful lanterns hanging outside gives it a festive look. Very peaceful. A must see for first timers.
43,4.0,"This small Korean Buddhist temple has held on despite the growth of the city around it.  It remains pretty modest, with the grounds mostly regular dirt.  There is one main temple, which is different from some Buddhiest temples I have visited in China and Japan.  What the complex lacks in size it makes up for with the beautiful interior of the temple.  You can come by to hear the monks chanting prayers for the faithful, it's really quite moving, even for non-Buddhists.  My 17 month old son was enraptured, the three giant Golden Buddhas and the chanting were certainly not like anything he had ever seen before. This is not necessarily a place to spend a great deal of time but it is worth a look, it is near other major attractions so a short jog out of your way to see this temple will be time well spent.  Please do keep in mind that this is a working religious space, not a tourist location per se so be prepared to be respectful of the local faithful."
44,4.0,"A different religion & culture and yet, a lot of similarity in the method of prayer to the Islamic way. Interesting architecture and rituals. Beautiful and peaceful."
45,5.0,"A small place with nothing much to see and do. But it is a GREAT place to experience peace in this temple. 3 huge golden Buddha at the main hall, with beautiful crafting on the wall and roof. Many Korean sit at the temple chanting. There is a small air-conditioning shop beside the temple, selling offerings (candles, rice, oil etc) to the Buddha. Touring may not be just sight-seeing, shopping and eating. It is also good to slow down your pace and sit at the temple to enjoy peace at heart, mind and soul."
46,5.0,"Best to go in may for the lantern festival or near that time. The temple will be all lit up with tens of thousands of lanterns and it's definitely a sight worth seeing. I took my parents there and I think it was one of their favorite things in Seoul. It's located near Instadon, so I recommend shopping in the afternoon, dinner and then the temple in the evening after dark."
47,4.0,We were lucky this temple is wirhin our hotel in Insadong.  Very beautiful at night where the lanterns are lighted.
48,4.0,"The first thing I want to mention is to remember that when visiting these temples is to remember that these are current places of worship for the Koreans. Not just another tourist stop for us. There was some special service occurring during the time of our tour and although we tried to stay out of the way, I did get the impression from more than a few 'little old ladies come to worship' that they could have done without the lookie loos. That being said, the temple and grounds area amazing and I would recommend going with a guide to get a first hand explanation for all the 'prayer' stations and their meaning. This is probably one of the best ways I can imagine to understand more about the culture that you are visiting. Just try to stay away from 'high prayer' time. lol."
49,5.0,"So we came here at 10pm at night and this place was absolutely amazing. First there were the lanterns and lights and the gate was bright and beautiful. Inside the temple, there were three gigantic Buddhas - the entire place was very quiet because the temple was filled with devotees who were sitting there meditating. Therefore the silence had a pregnant and peaceful feeling to it. Absolutely amazing"
50,5.0,"Having traveled to India and Thailand and seen different Buddhist temples, it was neat to come to this one in Seoul Korea. This is located in the Insadong neighborhood, popular with tourists and Korean goods. This temple always has worshipers and seems to be more active. It is a great spot to learn about the tradition and history of Buddhism in Korea."
51,5.0,Big Buddhist temple in central area of Seoul.It is nesr Insa-dong street.It opens all peaple of any relition.Enjoy Koran temple.
52,5.0,Super accessible and always has community events happening. It is such a great place to experience practical Buddhism in Korea.
53,5.0,"To be in Korea, this is in the middle of Seoul and close to other mayor attractions. For me it was very nice to be inside of a temple like this. Nice, nice..We have the good timing because we went in the lotus lantern festival time, so everything was very well decorated.Nice place to have a good experience as a traveler."
54,5.0,"Nice and colorful temple, it is not so big but you can see enough what it has... I went with stroller with my baby and was perfect becuase they have all the facilities for handicap people"
55,5.0,Absolutely beautiful temple. It's also up on a hill with lovely views. Remember to take your shoes off before entering the temple itself? A  must see.
56,3.0,"I've only entered a buddhist temple once, it was not as big, but this one beats it.  Probably the major difference was the presence of the sakura (cherry blossom) tree."
57,4.0,"An active temple, you can see many locals offer their prayers and gifts to Buddha. This is one of their most active temples and provides one a glimpse of some of the psyche the Korean people.They have a very old pine tree right behind the child buddha, a version I've not seen before. Their sacred tree has survived quite a few centuries and the more recent Korean War which destroyed a lot of buildings on site. A good respite from the hussle and bussle of very modern, commercial capital Seoul!"
58,5.0,"We were looking for a certain famous bell; we ended up in this Temple = Jogyesa.  The place captured more of our interest because there was an ongoing worship which sounded as if of the refrain all the time.  But through it all, it was well worth going there cause the place held 3 other attractions.  Trees you can whisper to; ceiling lanterns and solid white colored dangles (I don't really know if there's a name for it)."
59,3.0,"this is the first time I entered a temple. It is really beautiful. The decorations, especially the lanterns on the ceiling they are beautiful. it is clean and quiet. you will be seeing many donation of rice and waters in fronts."
60,5.0,"This was another nice stop on our free transit tour from the Incheon airport.  Nice buildings - serene atmosphere.  Active temple - ""mass"" in progress when we were visiting.  Special to see the ""old-world"" temple in the middle of modern buildings."
61,5.0,"Temple is easily accessible as it is located in the Seoul's city centre near Insa-dong. It is also free of charge to enter.We didn't know that it was the time for Chrysanthemum Festival and whole temple was decorated with flower-made statues or fugues and it looked so beautiful! Also we were impressed by the fact temple is on the open area next to the huge business buildings so you can see sacrum and profanum side by side.It is worth visit, but please note this is operating temple so as in any other religious place you should be quite and respect other people. Also taking photos of the insides of the building (where a ceremonies and prays are taking place) is prohibited."
62,5.0,I wanted to see a temple as I have in recent years developed an interest in Buddhism.  It was a fascinating experience that I felt very blessed to witness as it is an 'active' (not sure how to say it) temple with participants.  I witnessed a portion of a ceremony that took place outdoors.  It was quite moving.  The temple grounds are very peaceful and beautiful.  I could visit everyday and be content.
63,5.0,"The temple is big and clean, very quiet although the room is fully filled up with prayers. Grad that we had managed to get there by walking from Hotel PJ"
64,4.0,"I have been to many temples in Asia, and this is definitely one of the smaller ones. Although a great environment to be in, you will probably be done with this temple within 30 minutes. It is located in the middle of a busy city, so it is nice to be distracted from it. They offer some complimentary services to foreigners which was a nice surprise. Definitely check it out if you can."
65,4.0,This temple is hard to miss as it is located between office buildings and the structure of it is too outstanding.A great place to visit as a buddhist or not. Learn about Korean Religion here.
66,5.0,"The place is so full of spiritual aura and peaceful. Services were offered when we get there in celebration of Chuseok.You can see some distinctive features of the place like the pagoda, pond and old house."
67,5.0,"I don't think I can properly describe the beauty and peace of this temple.The colors are like the traditional ones found throughout the palaces and temples but the 3 giant Buddhas in the main hall were the highlight of this place.My aunt and I went during the mid morning/afternoon, and they were having service.I just felt a peacefulness with this whole temple.Just a complete calm that filled me."
68,5.0,"Stop by to offer some prayers there and feel so at home instantly! The temple is one of the oldest in Seoul and as Buddha devotee, we offer our prayers and even went inside for a peak of the temple prayers session. Remember to donate some to the temple!"
69,4.0,Visited this temple in the morning and was blown away by the architecture and colors used. I even shot a little video as a commemorative piece to honor Asian diversity. Worth a visit.
70,5.0,I always like to go here each time I go to Korea. It gives me a sense of peace. I'm not Buddhist but I feel spiritual and my soul relaxes each time I go here.
71,4.0,"we were lucky enough to visit the temple during Buddha's birthday celebration so they were having a party.   Live music and singers and it was filled with thousands of paper lanterns.  SO PRETTY.   We didn't stay long since it was absolutely over crowded that day, but we are glad we stopped by for a short visit."
72,3.0,"We could see only the outside part of temple. There was no way to enter the temple and visit all parts of it closely. In comparison to other temples, I do not recommend it to visit."
73,3.0,"Not sure if this is a must visit  but we got to visit this temple as part of the Seoul Transit Tour from Incheon airport. This is the next  stop after the Gyeongbok Palace and before the Insadong Street tour.We came in late Nov when there was a flower festival  (chrysanthenums ? ) displays, love hearts, etc  which makes the place very colourful for photography.The architecture of the temple is also worth admiring. Don t expect to able to spend more than half hour if you are not a temple enthusiast."
74,4.0,"Not far from the Westin Chosun this temple provides a slice of peace in the hectic city. We were lucky enough to go when there was a chrysanthemum festival which added colour to the scene. The temple itself is small and there is little around it, but the feeling of peace it generates is restful."
75,3.0,A gorgeously preserved temple that is still active. I did not find it as peaceful as some of the other temples I have visited. But its a great  space to catch your breathe after the bustle of Insadong.
76,5.0,"We were very fortunate to visit here during the celebrations of the Lotus Lantern Festival for Buddha's birthday. Many of the floats from the Lantern parade were on display and the entrance was covered with coloured lanterns. The street outside was blocked off and there were exhibitions, workshops, displays and beautiful ceremonies. The murals of the Buddhist temple show Buddha's life. It was a wonderful time to visit however without the lanterns, it would not be as exciting."
77,5.0,"A 5 minutes brisk walk from the Insadong shopping and souvenir district, this is a small temple with a main building and a couple of other smaller units. Yes there were quite a lot of people roaming about, but somehow it still felt quite relaxing. It could have been due to the sheer contrast between the old temple buildings and the surrounding modern ones, or maybe the fact that colourful flower beds and topiary plants, in the form of swans and elephants, gave the place a special feel. The outside of the temple is very attractive and inside there are some lovely buddha statues and ornate designs. It's also quite peaceful as it's forbidden to take pictures  inside. We spent about an hour visiting the temple and enjoyed every moment . Worth visiting."
78,3.0,This Temple really didn't stand out for me. My first thoughts when I got there was 'is this it??' I was quite disappointed. The Bhuddas were nice but theres not much to this temple... I think I spent around 10 minutes there and left...It's easy to get to and find though.
79,5.0,This was a beautiful temple. There were many people at the temple and the building and the Buddhas were well maintained and colorful. There was so much to look at and the place was very interesting. There was a relic stupa in the courtyard and a pretty bell pavilion where the bell is rung two times a day.
80,4.0,"This temple was beautiful. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing and learning about it. Our kids, ages 4 and 6 quickly grew bored. No photos allowed inside the temple building, it is an active temple."
81,4.0,"We were not allowed to enter the temple, being non-Buddhists. We saw from the outside the big Buddha statues. The atmosphere inside was very solemn. Outside, we took photographs to our hearts' content. The exterior of the temple, though not imposing, has beautiful architecture and paintings on the wall and roof. There was a tree artfully festooned with lots of colorful flowers. Flower offerings with small cards (prayers?) were outside, in the small garden. It could have been better if there were some benches for people to sit on and to try to meditate or take a short rest."
82,5.0,"It looks to be a very convenient temple since it's located in the city. I like the decorations and shiny, golden Buddha statues inside the temple. The murals on the walls were also interesting to look at or should I say ""stare"" at. I visited before the lantern festival and there were colorful lanterns hanging overhead in the temple grounds. There's also a baby Buddha statue beside a locust tree believed to be over 500 years old. There were some good shops right outside the temple and I wish I could have gotten more time during my 5 hour transit tour to buy a prayer bracelet of some kind. But my tour guide came in and urgently told me and my mother that we had to leave but right after that she walked some more with two English foreigners who wanted to buy a Buddha statue. This temple is really nice and convenient to visit especially if you've got time on your hands and want to see what Buddhism is like."
83,5.0,This is a small temple with only 1 main building so it doesn't take long to visit. It is such a beautiful temple though and a wonderful surprise as I really didn't know what to expect. There is a museum about Korea's Buddhism right next door in a modern looking building in the basement level and it's free. The paintings on the temple are gorgeous and the interior has colourful lanterns adorning the ceiling. The gold Buddha statues are also impressive.
84,5.0,"Go inside and see the large statues of Buddha, I experiences their prayer ceremony. Unique experience. Hardly takes 20 minutes to see it all."
