Many unique café restaurants & shops like traditional Korean rice cake packed in modern style, ladies boutiques, accessories shops etc. Very nice place to take photos! Towards end of street is a small eatery sell varieties of dumplings, packed with people, the dumplings are yummy! After this shop walk further cross the road is Insadong.My new findings for this trip - Ikseon-dong, located at Jongno 3 station exit 4. Check it out! Would love to try the cafe or restuarant next time in Seoul!"
