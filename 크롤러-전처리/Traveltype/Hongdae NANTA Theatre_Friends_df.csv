0,5.0,"Decided to catch the 8pm Nanta show in Hongdae (instead of the extremely popular Myeongdong one) as we stayed nearby the Hongdae theatre. We booked tickets online and bought zone S tickets, which is the 2nd most expensive tier with pretty good seats near the stage, towards the side.The show is 90 minutes worth of amazing percussion sets, comedy sketches and audience interaction. It's hard to explain exactly what sort of show it is because it's such a unique live performance, but I would 100% recommend it for a night of fun and entertainment. No knowledge of Korean language is needed. I personally LOVED it and I was absolutely floored at how talented and entertaining the cast was. The Green team performed for us and every single cast member was engaging, entertaining, dedicated and most importantly, appeared as though they genuinely enjoyed putting on a show for the audience. I'll have to admit that the ""nephew"" stole the show.. But no spoilers though! I do think that it would be better to choose a slot that has a packed theatre as the audience reactions and participations make for a more fun show. In any case, really loved it and would even consider catching another show with a different team the next time I'm in Seoul!"

While most of the show didn’t involve much verbal language, there was much body language, dancing, and drumming to communicate the story well. The show is very interactive and fun. Highly recommend for tourists in Seoul and in the hongdae area. I imagine the Nanta theatre near Myeongdong is also as good."
2,1.0,"“I think it is better for visitors to check the schedule and detail prior to the event to avoid bad experience like me . It just happen that i was in Hongdae on last Sunday (3/2/19 ) and i decided to watch the Nanta Show . I didnt planned or booked the ticket earlier but i did survey before they have few session per day. So i reach there around time 6.45pm , the counter indicated closed but i saw there were 2 staff sitting at the counter so without think twice I approach them asking where can i buy ticket and when is the next show in polite way , suddenly one of the staff stand up and bang the “ close” indicator on the desk like telling me if i was blind to read it . The indicator said “CLOSED , Ticket box open 1 hour before the show” , and my point is HOW DOES I KNOW what time is the show ?? !!!! So i asked again what time is the show ? Another staff reply it is at 8pm , ok then i assume the counter will be open soon . While waiting i realize there is a computer for visitors to book online (self service ),so I go to the computer to scroll more on the show since the staff were so ignorant, and out of sudden one of the staff approached me and “tell” me i cant buy today ticket either through online as well , while “telling” me her purpose was actually to off the computer !! I saw the screen turned off on purpose . Hey , i am an adult , i am not playing games on your computer ok !!!  I feel so disturbed and humiliated so i walk off from the theater. I wonder how funny & entertaining the show will be since the front line are so RUDE ! My advice is to book ticket online if you really interested to watch and avoid the front desk . You can collect the ticket only 1 hour before the show , if you reach earlier also pls wait first because they are not going to entertain you either ( i saw one other chinese family show their booking sheet and they point at the “ Closed”  indicator .If the front line are not ready to serve , my suggest is dont sit there ."
3,5.0,"Engaging, funny, it was one of the best days of our trip. You can walk around hongdae afterwards. It's not a problem if you don't speak korean, the performance is mainly non-verbal."
4,5.0,"Lively, engaging, funny, this show is absolutely worth seeing while in Seoul. The dancing, singing and music are so well timed and together, I was memorised more than once and on the edge of my seat, especially with the knives! Food goes flying, objects are thrown in to the audience and back and there are parts of the show that involve audience participation on stage, which is very funny. The performers are fantastic, so engaging and enthusiastic and you really connect with them very quickly. There is a gift shop too to buy souvenirs."
