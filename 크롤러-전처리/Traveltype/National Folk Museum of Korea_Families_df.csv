0,5.0,"This museum was located next to rear entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. The building design was quite unexpected and its concrete base rose high above the ground with a multi story pagoda located on the top.  There also was a nicely landscaped garden surrounding the museum.Inside were multiple exhibition halls that did a very good job in detailing the traditions and daily lives of the Korean people both past and present with artifacts (clothing, tools, replica homes, funeral biers, etc) and detailed explanations.   The special exhibit was focused on present day workers from Incheon and the work they did.  It was personal with their uniforms, biographies and the products they worked on (i.e. cars, textiles).  Admission was free.  A cafe was also located on the ground floor off to the side of the main entrance."
1,5.0,Interesting to see and read about the Korean folk life. You can pass through quickly or spend some time reading.
2,5.0,Good to experience the history of the ancient Korean people. Good and neatly displayed. Thanks for this experience
3,4.0,Best museum. We like the small hut outside the compound. The displays inside the museum were well organised. My 8 years old son found it very interesting. There is a children museum within the same building. My 1 year old son was having great fun there. A great place for adult and young children. Very educational and yet fun. Well done.
4,5.0,"We had a great and detailed introduction about life, culture and history of Korea. For a Korean culture lover like me, this is a great way to appease the thirst for knowledge about the country. I really appreciated how the museum have depicted the evolution and values of Korean people. Upon stepping outside the museum itself, one will be able to experience the games that Korean play during the old times. Like arrow throwing and rolling the metal rings. My family and I tried it but we are not that successful in accomplishing it. Nonetheless, it was a really fun experience for all of us. Inside the museum grounds are real-life replicas of Korean traditional houses, stores, printing machines and other structures (fully furnished) for tourists to enjoy."
5,3.0,"The museum is free as it is located inside the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Very informative for those who want to understand the culture and history of Korea. I find it a little bored because the Korean culture is almost similar to the culture for Chinese. Thus, we do not need much more explanation on many exhibition."
6,5.0,We loved this museum. It was a great opportunity to get a glimpse of how South Korean lived before and how they went with their lives day in and day out. The place was so serene. This museum offered a load of great spots to see with no  admission fee.
7,5.0,I really liked this alot. It is included in the price of the Palace ticket. It gives you the history of Korea and definitely some very cool artifacts. swords etc.
8,5.0,"and free. what more can you ask from a museum?A day before, we went to the national museum, to study more about the history of Korea.I must admit, the time-line was better presented and explained here.An appealing exhibition for all ages.Currently, they have a temp. exhibition about SALT. Very informative, with tastings - a must for foodies and others who are into this topic."
9,5.0,like any other museum . this museum tells us the history of korean more to the folk not to the historical like wars and any other things . in this museum you can see how old korean people doing the activities. this place is very near to gyeongbok palace .

11,4.0,"My teenage sister and I enjoy museums so we decided to try out The National Folk Museum on a whim. And pleasantly enough, we enjoyed it a lot more than we thought we would. There's a lot of interesting culture and folk history explained here so we got to learn a lot more than we bargained for (well for free) regarding Korean culture and heritage. We learned about ancient astrology, village deities, marriage ceremonies, funeral rites, you name it -- we learned it. We had a lot of fun so come out and take advantage of this free museum."
12,5.0,"So cool!!! I had a great time there. That place is the best way to see historical aspects of Korea, to know more about the lives of Korean old days. I will go back again!"
13,4.0,We were drawn here from Gyeongbukgong Palance by the pagoda. Thought it was part of the palace but then realised it wasn't when we had to exit the grounds.We didn't have time to go in (The discover Seoul Pass had a free entry here too) but wandered around outside as we wandered towards the exit.There was a village outside which looked like they were from the olden days. The village had shops and barbers and they all had displays of what it would've been like in the past.Quite a nice place to stroll around.
14,4.0,"This museum is connected to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The Palace is just physical buildings, the museum tells the stories of Korean people and how they lived their daily lives in the past. A great combination!"
15,5.0,"it is near Gyeongbokgung Palace. Hence, visiting one after the other is a nice addition to your Seoul Itinerary.  It is a free museum that exhibits Korean culture and traditions.  When we visited, it is a bit crowded because of the many tourists who avoided the cold weather outside.  There is a souvenir shop located inside."
16,5.0,"This museum is a must visit place when you are in Gyeongbokgung. A lot of exhibitions and it's all free. You can learn about their culture. As we came there, they had special exhibition about the year of dog."
17,4.0,We were not able to explore the inside but we had lots of picture from the outside. it's clean and well maintained and lots of flowers on display (we went during spring)
18,5.0,"What an interesting place to visit! Outdoor and Indoor, and it is free!! From traditional Korean buildings to clothings, Korean life to food, etc displayed. Only problem was there are not much information written about them. So basically I only read name of things displayed without knowing what they were. Then I found out Free Audio Guide was available at the reception. So don't forget to grab one."
19,5.0,Free admission to a great museum. Kids love it. All adulsts in the group enjoyed... Surrounding enviornment is full of exhibits...
20,4.0,Excellent museum for a visit into Korea's history and culture. Well kept with superb exhibits and art collections. I strongly recommend it.
21,5.0,The museum shows how Koreans live in past and now. The exhibits are interesting. We can know better about Koreans after visiting the museum.The museum is free admission. Don't miss it.
22,4.0,"This is located next to Gyeongbokgung Palace so you might want to stroll through this museum. The exhibits are relatively modest compared to the exterior appearance. What I found interesting is the small outdoor exhibit just next to the museum. It is a small recreation of a Korean town in the late 50's-early 70's. if you lived in Korea during this time, the dabang tea house, manwha bang comic store, etc. will take you back."
23,5.0,"We've visited part of the main Museum, and also the kid's part where the traditional story tails are told with funny activities."
24,4.0,We really enjoyed the displays of Korean life. Great displays of what Korean life was like throughout the ages. It is a free entry to the museum and is on the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Good place to take a break and learn more about Korean life.
25,4.0,"This place is connected to one of the Palaces and it is actually free.  On the side is the museum with lots of history and a shop to have some coffee, hot chocolate or ice cream and also clean bathrooms.   When you step out you can walk around and it has different exhibition where you can get lots of beautiful pictures.  After that you can actually walk for about 5 to one of the Folk villages and have lunch walk around and check shops.   WE found out that you can actually rent the typical South Korea dresses from across the street and get your picture taking while walking the areas."
26,4.0,The museum were just a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung palace. So please make an effort to visit the museum as it will give your the history from 'birth to death'of the people in Korea. Atleast you gain more knowledge of another culture in another country.
27,4.0,"1) Open (spring) 9:00–18:00. No holidays — it's open every day. 2) Free admission.3) Don't forget to visit outdoor exposition! Small folk village and a street of 70-80 of the XX century.4) Good cafe. If it's cold outside I recommend you my favourite Honey and Ginger tea. It's natural.5) Children's Museum, small nursery room, nice shop."
28,4.0,"History of korean, large museum, this descripe about korean habits and cultures, impressive history, must come of you want to know about korean"
29,3.0,"Take this lightly.....an ordinary first time visitor may have found it OK,, you can make photo, back home you can show to friends, proving you have visited it...However this is a tourist attraction that any traveler would have considered at least once to visit itGet to know a bit more about a bit of story behind every display..."
30,3.0,Nice Museum to visit to learn about the history of South Korea. Spend about 1 and a half hour in the museum and have an eye opener here!
31,5.0,"Very informative museum about Korean history like the clothes, culture and etc. There was also a children's museum but i didn't get to visit as they had time slots."
32,5.0,We visited the Folk Museum and what a great way to take a short history lesson and understand Korean culture at the same time.  The museum gave us a glimpse of history as well as Korean everyday life.  Exhibits were excellent and very well-arranged.  There were also interactive displays and audio-visual presentations which were very informative.  Definitely a must see!
33,4.0,It localed just next to the Gyeongbokgung. Easily walk around and have a look of some pass history and culture of farmers in the old days. Quite nice.
34,5.0,"Like all museums we visited in South Korea, it was cheap, very informative and remarkably uncrowded.Lots of Korean couples were at the museum in traditional costume (hanbok)  to take photos of each other against the traditional buildings in the museum grounds."
35,5.0,"Because it's right next to the Palace and there was no charge, we decided to visit.  And I'm glad we did!  It is a wonderfully informative museum of the history of Korea.  How can you not love a history that starts at 700,000 BC?!"
36,4.0,"Located near Gyeongbokgung Palace, one of the most visited and iconic landmark of the city, this is a good place to dropby for a visit if you want to fully experience and immerse in the rich Korean culture and history that spans over 600 over years. There museum is big and has quite a big collection of exhibits, displays, paintings that depicted the life of the Korean people of the past that is fascinating and interesting to learn about it.You will not miss the gift and souvenir shop that offer visitors to take home some of the unique collectibles items like postcards, keychains, the miniature hanbok costumes, hand fans etc.And of course if you are not a fan of the Korean culture or history, you may find this place boring and unattractive but credit must still be awarded to the curator for presenting and sharing its rich cultural and historical aspects of the country to the world!"
37,4.0,"If ever you're planning to visit Gyeongbokgung (or Gyeongbok Palace), try to include the National Folk Museum in your itinerary.  It is located within the palace grounds and it's a free attraction.It shows South Korea's history from the Stone Age up to the present."
38,5.0,"Very, very lovely folk museum.  We loved wandering through the exhibits. It was a nice escape from the heat outside.  Loved the acupuncture exhibit."
39,4.0,"We visited this museum after viewing the palace grounds, as we had some time to spare before the changing of the guard ceremony. Admission is free with entrance to the palace, thus crowds are guaranteed here. It was uncomfortable being bumped from room to room, and we did not even try to get into one of the more crowded display areas.There are quite good displays on korean life, including clothing, tools for farming and household use, different types of houses and foods.There is also a small gift shop near the exit. We rushed through the displays in half an hour, and were happy to be outside away from the crowd. To the right of the folk museum is a recreated village which depicts life in different centuries. We were able to enjoy the exhibits here at our own pace, as most guests did not seem to be aware of it."
40,5.0,You really can learn/study what Korean lives were and are these days; from birth to death referring to varous displays of what these were/are.
41,5.0,One of the best museums in Seoul. Free Admission.Interesting collections. Ideal for family with teens.
42,4.0,This museum provides an interesting introduction to Korean history and culture.  With exhibits inside and attractive walks outside it is ideal whatever the weather.  Cafe and shop available and good toilet facilities.
43,4.0,It's nice to find some of the museums inside/nearby the Gyeongbokgong with free admission and this is one of them.Lots of replicas and history objects displayed here.
44,5.0,"One thing I love about Korean museums is how they use media. Located inside Geongbokgung Palace it's a quiet break from the hustle of the city. It takes you on a very deliberate path through history making wonderful use of large displays, videos and creative media. Myself (in my 20s) and my parents (both in their 60s) loved this museum and felt it showed a different perspective than the other places we had gone. It is not as sterile as the National Museum and showed what life was like for people at all levels of society over the years."
45,5.0,"This was perhaps the most educational stop in Korea. Houses from many different eras and socio-economic levels. Demonstrations of traditional dance, sports, weddings, etc. Food court with excellent choices."
46,5.0,"What a great space! There is an audio tour in English!! The tour gave a great insight to what it was like for Koreans from the beginning to the present.  The pottery exhibit was the best well, except for the making cloth exhibit:)  The traditional house models were amazing as well.  Great for the whole family!"
47,5.0,"The whole grounds are very beautiful, the architecture is amazing, a lot of detail. The museum tells the history of the Korean people. The buildings even have the the ones that the concubines lived in."
48,5.0,"Very big, will require a lot of walking around. However, it gives you a good insight of Korean culture. A must see."
49,5.0,This is a wonderful place to spend a day.  Children will love all the areas to run around outside and adults will be enjoy the exhibits.  After you have explored the museum go to the snack bar and enjoy some soft serve ice cream and tea.
50,5.0,"Koreans do everything better. In this museum they mixed it with art, music and design to attract the senses to make the museum entertaining and fun. Connect this tour with your geokbong palace tour."
51,4.0,"It's a pretty big ground to cover. Usually they will take you to get a glimpse of the president's palace on the way to this place. There are some interesting spots you can take pictures in, such as the 'rich man's' house and the 'poor man's house' as well as the old tram and the old korean street. The children's museum is worth a visit as well."
52,4.0,"The presentation of the artifacts in the National Museum made it much more intersting and alive to me than the National Museum in Yongsan, Seoul.  It was one of the most interesting and informative museums on Korean history and culture.  I will be returning for a second visit, and am sure there are cool things I missed during my first two hour visit."
53,4.0,Great to visit. English provided for exhibit very good. Limited cafe. We were hungry but nothing substantial to eat.
54,4.0,"If you are interested in the history of Korea and the Korean culture you should visit this museum. The exposition we visited explained the development of Korean culture quite good and vividly. Unfortunately,  most descriptions are in Korean only."
55,5.0,Very Nice Museum Explanations available in English Free entryEasy to access after visiting Gyeongbokung palace.Pretty garden around the museum.Audio guide available
56,4.0,"Within & adjacent to the grand palace grounds is the Folk Museum with an interesting collection of artifacts, items on display that traced the history & culture of the ordinary life style of the Korean household, including the influence of the Chinese and the changes from the Japanese occupation & ruling. This is apparently a popular place for SK's school-aged children for their educational field trip, escorted by their teachers - even 4, 5 or 6 years old are exposed to the exhibits on a nice, cool early Fall day in September during our visit - I wondered if perhaps, those children are simply too young to understand and appreciate it all. On the first floor of the complex is a gift shop, a cafe and restrooms - which are kept clean by housekeeping staff in between use, despite the dozens & hundreds of tourists pouring thru every hour, many led by guides waiving banners as their herds of PRC mainland sightseers continued to roam thru by the busloads."
57,4.0,There are many interesting things inside. Also it is very near to Gyeongbokgung Palace. A place should visit when you are in Seoul.
58,3.0,"My parents and I visited this museum on the same day as the visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is right inside and actually visitors need to pay separate entrance fees but if you are visiting on the last Wednesday of each month the entrance fee is waived. The exhibits are interesting and there is an outdoor area which has life-sized models of traditional village huts etc but I think its similar to the folk village museum in Jeju that I visited earlier on the same trip, so its not a big deal for me. There is a children's area which may be fun or educational if you have young children. I liked the section on the music, language and rituals and ceremonies of the korean people. You can see the beautiful traditional costumes and musical instruments (and even hear how they sound when played) and also appreciate the rich traditions, history and culture of the korean people. There is also a cafe and 2 toilets within the museum and free drinking water fountains. There is also an outdoor resting area with shade from trees so its really nice to sit there and enjoy the day if its bright and sunny and not too warm e.g. autumn or spring."
59,5.0,I visited the museum while at the palace. I found it first looking for the palace. There are some great history lessons including the Book of Corrections.
60,4.0,the place was well organized andeasy access from station. building was clean and there were activity for small kids and thats save our time.innext to there was big park.nice place to travel in morning until lunch.
61,5.0,"This museum is within the Changdeokgun Palace.  Big place, so comfortable shoes highly recommended,good for family, kids."
62,3.0,This is a cute little Folk Museum and its not far from the palace.If you want to learn about Korean history check it out I recommend you go it's got a nice detailed history of Imperial Asia history about Korea and what the palacesRepresent There's also a kid's section in the museum and it's a really nice kid friendly area
63,5.0,I love museums that are architecturally interesting and modern and this one does not disappoint. We stopped in after viewing the nearby palace and found the two perfect for a early morning walking tour.
64,5.0,"This little folk museum in right next to Gyeongbukgong, the must see imperial palace of Korea. I can't quite recall if it is only accessible from Gyeongbukgong or from the street, but you must visit the palace, so I recommend wandering through the palace first, then coming here. You have to spend a good hour in the folk museum which had a bunch of traditional and cultural artifacts, an ancient Hanok home, and a ~1960s style shopping street.As someone who knows very little about Korean culture, I found the entire museum to be fascinating, this may be different depending on the depth of your knowledge, but I really enjoyed it. It is a great introduction to Korean culture."
65,5.0,Beautiful curation. Nice and compact so as not overwhelming. Well chosen artifacts well explained in English. Outdoor exhibitions great too. When we went admission was free. They had a superb display on woodblock printing. Rest and have a cup of green tea with black rice in the cafe. And the toilet facilities are great too. Two hours well spent.
66,5.0,"Our family very much enjoyed this Museum.  Grandpa, us and kids ages 18 and 11.  Wonderful English language tour, displays also titled in English.  Displays putting items in context in a very visitor friendly way."
67,4.0,"For the first time visitor, the National Folk Museum is a must-do: it's a beautiful and interesting introduction to Korean culture, traditions and history.The building is connected to the National Children's Museum; if you are visiting with children between 4 and 12 years old, it can be included too for an interesting (but long) afternoon at both museums.The surrounding gardens are well manicured and spotless, and they provide a lovely setting for a picnic or for reading a book.Bring comfortable walking shoes, water and snacks. Like other attractions in Seoul, entry is free of charge."
68,5.0,I love history so I found everything fascinating and breath taking. I was in awe. We went on a Wednesday and it was free entry :). Do visit if you're visiting Gyeonbukgung palace as it is right beside the palace.
69,4.0,"There was lots to see in this museum with rooms set up to show traditional events such as weddings and funerals. It was cool to see how colorful things were. There were replicas of traditional villages and much of it was open air/outdoors. Indoors there was stuff about the history of Korea and with a timeline of historic events. There were examples of tools used in the home and garden. And cultural information about things like the special 1 year and 60 year birthdays, Korean medicine, and education.They offer musical performances on the weekends with dances and traditional music. There was a small cafe and museum shop but we did not make any purchases. Wheelchairs and strollers were also available free of charge.They offer guided tours in English, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.Hours vary throughout the year based on the season so be sure to check before you go.We enjoyed our visit."
70,4.0,"I must say traditional culture (food, clothes) is not a huge interest of mine. I have always found that it wasn't really reflective of the Korean society, and Koreans today hardly know more than foreigners about their ancient culture (beyond the actual history of what happened). Yet, I found myself enjoying the museum. The location is a great sales point, as it's tucked right by the side of Gyeongbokgung. The pagoda really stands out from a distance and is visually striking. Outside, there's also a nice exhibit of how Korea evolved through the decades and you can get a glimpse of how fast the country (and its culture) changed. Inside the museum, you'll get all you can expect from a museum presenting traditional artifacts. The museum is truly big, an there's a lot to enjoy. However, it feels a tiny bit dated (lightning, interaction) compared to other museums in Seoul such as the National Museum of Korea, the War Memorial of Korea or the Korean Museum of Contemporary History. Also, be aware that this museum attracts a lot of kids coming in with their parents or school, so it might get a bit noisy."
71,5.0,"We happened there during a national holiday, so everything was free!  The exhibits are beautifully laid out, detailing Korean history, daily life over the years, traditional clothing, houses, arts, crafts, writings, etc.  Many different rooms, all very impressive.  Then we came to the children's museum, housed within the bigger museum.  Get there early for tickets (again, free for us that day), because they have designated time slots.  They had a lovely exhibit centered on a traditional Korean folk tale, really neat and varied displays, all hanfs-on for kids.  But the highlight was the ""Golden Poo"" exhibit!  Different displays of number 2, historic samples of toilets, advice on how to achieve a golden poo; it was hilarious and fun, definitely one of the highlights of our trip!"
72,5.0,"Had a nice and terrific visit in National Folk Museum of Korea. I felt like I'm one the Korean actresses.. I was able to explore and learn about the history of Korean people. Lucky me there was a traditional Korean dance happened when I visited the place... the place is so crowded thou, a lot of kids were have a field trip,. Things to do? just walk and walk until you reach the King's palace."
73,5.0,"In additional to what others is saying about this ""Excellent representation of Korean people life style"" attraction; Words cannot express my sincere thoughts about what too numerous of Korean musicians was saying in English on signpost/plaques in the ""Musician theme park"" section. My/our impression is/was you will definitely be so thankful you visited this theme park attraction...."
74,5.0,"As with most Korean museums I had come across, the National Folk Museum of Korea next to Gyeongbokgung Palace was inspiring, information and a total joy to spend time in.The museum is divided into sections showing stages in a Korean person's life from birth to death. As Asian, I was fully in tune with this arrangement as it adheres to the Asian life cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death. The exhibits were fascinating, presenting visitors with mock-ups of traditional houses and buildings, life-size figures in traditional garb and authentic objects used in ceremonies and everyday life. Along the way, the signs gave in-depth detail about facets of Korea. This museum is a wonderful orientation for visitors to this unique land. Of course, there were tour groups running around, but the area was spacious enough so you did not feel boxed in. I would love to revisit it to learn more."
75,4.0,We reached here after walking through the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds. The museum is free and it is very interesting understanding about the Korean History and Culture. The signs are in English so it is not necessary to have a guide. It is really an interesting place to visit.
76,5.0,"Galleries showcasing life size display of houses, shoes, ornaments. The museum captures their culture and well-presented these through the different exhibits and architecture. Entrance is free. A must see place after the Palace, as near by n proceed to Bakchon Hanok Village there after!"
77,4.0,If you are the type who likes to know the history of a place then you will love this museum.  It has a wide variety of articles that show the history of the korean people especially their tradition.  Gives you a glimpse of how they lived thousand of years ago.  You will be surprised to see some of these traditions still being practiced today. Well preserved and well presented.
78,4.0,Good for afternoon walk not to much to do for kids typical Korean museum. Def nice for picture if you love photography
79,4.0,"After seeing much of Gyeonbokgung Palace, we proceeded to this very nice museum.Several galleries of very colorful, well-done, intricate and informative displays will greet you in this building.This is a must-visit in Seoul."
