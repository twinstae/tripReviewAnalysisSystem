0,5.0,"I have travelled to Seoul 5 times over the last 10 years and each time I visit this place to top up or renew my wardrobe. If you like trendy clothes and design, and not fuss with brand names, this is the place for you. Although, a lot of the design are somewhat copies of the major design houses, but most stuff have their own brands.  Some of the stitching can be better however, the materials are generally quite good. Even ones I pay 4 to 5 times the value back home are of more inferior quality. However, remember to negotiate the prices, especially men's clothes because you can quite easily get ripped off otherwise."
