0,4.0,A huge “park” but really it’s the whole mountain!  There’s paved sidewalks for pedestrians who wish to walk up/down as well as well travelled trails for those who want more of a hike on either sloped or flat terrain. Facilities are available at the peak upon your arrival by foot or motor vehicle (ie tour buses as well as city buses). Cable car is another option. Lots of cyclists also enjoy this park. Go for it!
1,5.0,"Go up there when the weather is nice for a stunning view. Be ready to queue for the cable car, 40 min for us and it can be up to 90 min!Everyday there is a traditional show not to be missedFood court, few souvenirs shops and many many Love lockers..."
2,3.0,"Wasn’t overly impressed with the Namsan Park plus it was brutally hot and humid this day. The views are like any other city highest point views. You may say “oooh’s” and “aaahhh’s” take 4 pictures - one from North, South, East and West than go back down to the streets and go discover some unexplored back alleyways this is what Seoul is about."
3,4.0,"It is the largest park in Seoul and is well-known for its beautiful walking trails. Most visitors come to Namsan Park to enjoy the views, the nature or go for a hike. The iconic landmark in this park is the Namsan Seoul Tower. There are 3 options to reach the top - hike all the way, take public bus or cable car. On top, one can have a panoramic view of downtown Seoul."
4,5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous urban park, a hidden treasure in Seoul.  I started my walk on the Millennium Hilton side.  Such gorgeous vistas in every direction - nature + modern architecture + statues to Korean heroes.  So beautiful!"
5,5.0,"I visiten Namsan Park lot of times and everytime I love this place more and more. Mazing view, tons of green space, lovely people and close to center. I will be back there for sure."
6,4.0,"The park is packed on Sunday. Children were playing traditional Korean games (free). Families enjoy the day out. Couples leave lock testament of their love. There’s enough restaurants up there, with a good variety for children, to keep people happy. You can feed pigeons and enjoy the scenery."
7,4.0,"I visited at night and can confirm that the view of the city looks great. there is a place at the top to buy food and drink, nice way to pass a few hours."
8,3.0,Went there by the cable car. The cable car is small and stuffy. Walking is better if you have the strength as the walk is steep and uphill. It's a one time visit since it overlooks the whole city. The night view is better in comparison to the day view as Seoul can be cloudy at times.
9,5.0,"I was fortunate to visit Namsan Park on a gloriously clear day. The views of Seoul from the peak are fabulous, but if the weather was bad I doubt you'd see much. Took the Metro and then caught a bus up the mountain - otherwise it would be a very long walk to the top. Alternatively, you could take the cable car, but I was on a budget. At the peak there is the usual collection of over-priced eating places, so either take your own food, or eat when you get back down the mountain. On a hot day you'll need plenty of water if you plan walking the many trails that criss-cross the mountain. Great place to visit to see the native vegetation and experience the calming environment on the walking trails, where you won't encounter too many other people."
10,4.0,"I visited this on a bus tour and was intrigued by the panoramic views it provided of the city. Unfortunately, there is quite a smog issue with Seoul and it really diminishes from the appeal. In fact most of the time outside in Seoul I wore an N99 filter mask.It is still an attraction worth a visit. It might be a bit of an arduous trek uphill for some but the main area and Seoul Tower entrance is relatively close to the bus stop. The area around it is free to access and there are several restrooms. I never ascended the tower as I was happy with the views I got from the courtyard.There is a fence where lovebirds can attach locks securing their relationship. Worthwhile visit for a great view of the city."
11,4.0,"Went up by cable car at night. It was a bit crowded at the top but the atmosphere (lights, etc.) and views over the different parts of the city were amazing. Some bars and restaurants underneath the Seoul tower offered good views over the city as well. Lots of ""love locks"" all over the place!"
12,3.0,"This place has besutiful views of the city of Seoul. I went there bu cable car, which costs about 8,000 Won for a ride of less than 5 minutes. It’s better to go there by public bus or the hop-on hop-off shuttle bus from the Koreana Hotel. I was shocked to see the many thousands of “love padlocks” almost completely covering the walkway railing, and completely covering some tree-like structures built just for people to attach their padlocks. Other cities like Paris are cracking down on this thoughtless pracrice"
13,5.0,"beautiful scenery, clean air and lovely place for couples to dining and take picture and at the same time locked their love with the pad lock"
14,4.0,"it is a great place to go to, by bus hiking or by cable car. Depends on your budget, but it is an amazing view and you can relax eat some food, buy some souvenirs or just take some amazing fotos, you can also buy a lock and lock it at a viewing balcony at the bottom of the tower, either with your friends, your loved ones or just cause you want to say you were there."
15,3.0,"A park in the middle of the city, great to go by and relax for a while. There is the tower, a cable car and a lot of green area to walk by."
16,3.0,"I just wrote a review of the N. Seoul Tower that is located here within Namsan Park and concluded with the Rhetorical Question : Why did I bother to write this review.My answer was this : As a result of my visit to the N. Seoul Tower and to Namsan Park on a dark, overcast, gray day with snow falling, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE visit either attraction when the weather is inclement.So why did I even bother to visit Namsan Park on a bad weather day? Because it was my last opportunity to do so and I really wanted to see both the N. Seoul Tower along with Namsan Park."
17,5.0,The night view of the city from the top is wonderful. Don't forget to book cable car for round ticket.
18,5.0,"I really liked visiting this park as I was on my way to the North Seoul Tower. I took the Metro from City Hall to Myeong-dong station and then asked a young man in the ticket booth the best way to the Tower. I took the cable car and was soon enjoying the views from the Park at the top. It was a glorious, sunny autumnal day and the views of the city were wonderful.I took my time up there, not only to admire the panorama but also to enjoy the peace and people watch. The place was quite busy, even though it was a weekday morning. There were quite a few groups of young children having impromptu picnics and older, uniformed adolescents showing off. The park really seemed to be popular with both young and old, local and international people. I was reminded of the Hohenzollernbridge in Cologne when I saw all the love locks in one area near an apparent beer garden which was unfortunately colsed on the day I visited. The place was absolutely covered in love locks - clearly the man in the nearby booth had been doing a roaring trade in selling them."
19,4.0,Good morning walk or run up the 5000steps to namsan hilltop. Great view and fresh air. Great spot to catch the sunrise. There are buses going up. Easy to walk up from Namdaemun market or courtyard marriott. About 30min to run up.
20,4.0,"Go to Namasan tower for a good view, even if there is long queue, it is worth it. Also take the cable car, the view is just stunningly beautiful!"
21,5.0,This is one of the stunning place to go at night time. We took the subway to Meyoungdong and walk up to the mountain. Took the cable car to Namsan and enjoy the views after sunset. Stunning.
22,4.0,I visited this park 3 times during my August visit. I suggest starting from one end and walking to the tower (it takes 40 minutes from Seoul Station) and then exiting the park via the MUCH less crowded eastern end. The east part is much less crowded and allows you to see another portion of the wall and nice scenery as well. It is much busier to visit here at night (avoid weekends) but something you should do at least once for the good view. There is a bus but I find walking much more rewarding.
23,4.0,The views were fantastic I was here for sun set one afternoon and the area was quite alive. There were live performances and people everywhere. It was great.
24,4.0,Nice hike to the top (moderate and approximately 30 minutes) or you can take the bus or cable car. Good view of the city at sunset.
25,4.0,"This park is home Mt. Namsan with N Seoul Tower located at the peak.  To reach N Seoul Tower at the peak of Mt. Namsan, you can walk along the hiking trails, take a bus, or take a cable car.  At the peak of the park, there is a free observation deck with a good view of Seoul.  For a better view, you can pay to go to the top of N Seoul Tower.Around the base of N Seoul Tower at the peak of Mt. Namsan, there is an amazing number of love locks.  There is even a vending machine selling love locks.  Other facilities include restaurants, food outlets, game arcade, gift shop, and plenty of photo ops."
26,5.0,"You pay to go up, but you can save that payment if you end up eating at the restaurant up there. The restaurant averages around $30 to $40 per person so you can do your calculation if it is meanwhile or not. The food is actually good and the view is even better. The best time is to go at night and you can see the lighted up area of Seoul. There are kiosks at the bottom of the park and can enjoy a few beers at the restaurants there.In order to get here, you can either take a taxi, take the local bus 401 or 405 and change to another small one or walk up from the main Namsan street (a good 20 minutes). I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
27,4.0,Lovely landscaping. One of the places in Seoul where locals are actually not throwing trash everywhere. Stayed at the Hyatt right next to ine of the entrances. Very convenient. A lot of dogs though...
28,4.0,Went there using cable car. Very nice trip that allow you to enjoy different aspects of Seoul City. Definitely a must !
29,3.0,"The view of the city would be similar to other countries - Malaysia, Hong Kong, etc. What makes it attractive is the morning walk with a cool weather, that is, if you’d visit during the cold seasons."
30,3.0,Nice gentle hike up cobbled stone steps all the way to Seoul Tower. Rural space in the middle of the city
31,4.0,"Namsan Park is a hill, which is located in southern part of downtown Seoul. There is a rope way to the top of hill, where there is a tower. But you can also walk from Myondon or Seoul station. It takes less than one hour. From the hilltop, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Seoul."
32,4.0,"If you can avoid crowded times, plan to take the cable car to the park from Meongdong. Then go to the top of Namsan Tower where you will have amazing views of the city (assuming it is a low pollution night)."
33,4.0,Seoul tower on cloudy day. This place is famous for the lock that promises love. Visitors hang their own locks
34,5.0,Beautiful views!!!! Easy access with city buses (search park online and website tells you where buses pick up!). The locks are really cool too.
35,4.0,A worthwile place to seek nature but can be crowded. The hike above towards the tower provides fantastic views over the surroundings of thr city.
36,5.0,"It's nice to take the short cable car ride up and then go up Seoul Tower. The park is excellently manicured with flowers, trees, and other landscaping."
37,5.0,Great park. Very relaxing. I came here when Chuseok and so many people spending time here. They played traditional games and we can try to play too.
38,5.0,"The park is so beautiful during autumn! I highly recommend hiking up to N Seoul Tower instead of taking the cable car. You will walk among the beautiful red and golden leaves, pass by ancient city walls, took lots of pictures which turn up amazing especially during sunset, and save a couple thousand won to spend in Myeongdong. The walk is not that hard (LOTS of stairs) and the trail is easy. Sunset view is really incredible from the observation deck on top."
39,4.0,"Nam Mountain has a lot to do, including the hiking, the tower and the cable car. Wait until you have one of Seoul's rare clear days to get the most of the experience."
40,4.0,"I visited Namsan Park over 2 separate days, first time was during the day where I decided to hike around the trails up to N.Tower and back down another trail which lead me to the National Theatre of Korea. There are many trails within the park and each one is leisurely and not too tough, a lot of steps but it is worth the effort. In the midst of a busy city there is this wonderful park to hike around is a gift. My re-visit was early evening to see the city all lit up at night and this time, I opted to go up the glass elevator to the cable car ride up. Having experienced both the hike up and cable car, I would recommend that you do both if you get the chance but if you had to pick one I would recommend the hike as there was something soothing about the hike up. N Tower at the top is pretty much a tourist point with great views of the city, the toilets up the tower surprised me as each cubicle had a window to the outside world, peeing in full view of the city was a novelty factor for sure."
41,5.0,This was a really nice morning.  You can get some nice views of Seoul from here.  Can get thr cable car (see reviews) or walk. Lot of steps however not too difficult maybe 30 mins. I got the car up and walked down. Can see the N tower too and just soak it in. Not really too busy as there's a lot of space.
42,5.0,"The trails and scenery in Namsan Park are beautiful, but it is a very steep uphill climb. You might want to ride the cable car up and then walk down to enjoy the scenery."
43,5.0,Very nice. You  must go. You can walk or use to cable car. But much more person all time waiting for get on cable car.
44,4.0,"The part is on the hill surrounding the N Tower. It is green, offers some view on the city and some other perks."
45,5.0,"A smaller mountain in the middle of Seoul. It has a park with paved pedestrian roads, mudtrails in the mountain, a walking path on the nothern side and several outdoor gyms in and around. On the top is Seoul tower which you can either walk up to or take a cable car to.  Accessible green area open for everyone. A little lung in the city."
46,4.0,"Popular with locals for hiking and tourist since it's the base of N Seoul Tower. Offers the most spectacular views of Downtown Seoul. Though most visitors come to Namsan Park to enjoy the views, N Seoul Tower and Locks of Love, a wall of locks that symbolizes endless love for those who hang them. There is no entrance fee to visit the park including Locks of Love and the Beacon Hill site. Taking the cable car up is the easiest and most convenient way up but it does require a paid ticket and also entrance fee to go up the N Seoul Tower. Take the Subway Line 4 to Myeondong Station Exit 4 and walk up about 20 minutes to the base of the base of the Namsan Park Cable Car. There are also several buses that can take you up there."
47,5.0,I recommend hiking up to Seoul tower on the top. You can enjoy the park scenery along the way. There're many stairs leading to the top form almost every direction. Somehow an open maps like maps.me is more accurate than google map.Taking cable car down is also a good experience.
48,5.0,It is one of the best places to get some panoramic views of Seoul. The park is quite big so you can spend a few hours there.
49,4.0,"Spent about 2 hours here.  The cable car doesn't have any seats.  They just cram everyone in, so make sure you cram yourself next to a window for a view.The park itself was interesting.  A bit of a walk and lots of stairs, but there are nice gazebos to rest along the way.  There's a big food court at the top.  I didn't eat there though.  It's a nice place to stroll around, take pictures, and move on."
50,4.0,I went here all alone by foot. It was difficult to walk up hahaha. But everything is worth it. I like the environment and nature around. Best to visit here when it is shiny but not hot.
51,5.0,Lots to see and do around tge base of the N Seoul Tower. There is a theme of love in the air. Very photogenic area coupled with stunning views over the city. Bus no 2 takes you directly up.
52,5.0,"No cars are allowed on Namsan Hill to so to get there, options are walk up, public bus or cable car. I have a complimentary shuttle from my hotel to the cable car station. Went up to the park via cable car and took a leisurely stroll down . Managed to catch the 3pm cultural show and enjoyed the view of Seoul before taking a east stroll downhill . There are many paths down - there is a shorter way via steps and a longer windy way following the bus route. I took the later and have no regrets . The walk down was beautiful on a spring day and if time permits one can wander and discover. I accidentally stumbled on the beautiful Ahn Jung-geun Memorial park ."
53,4.0,Came here today to explore and to find some geocaches. The park is very hilly however it has nice steps to walk up and down and area to get away from the rain like I did today. Nice to come here to get away from the volume of people and traffic.
54,5.0,"Stayed near Namdaemun market and walking up the northern circuit was how I started each morning.  I was amazed at how many people were already coming down at 8 am.  You can go up the southern circuit to Seoul N tower as well.The park is really well cared for and you can tell that people feel a lot of pride for it.  Also amazed to see many people who are visually impaired walking, using the middle plastic road separator as a guide.  The majority of people I saw on the trails were at least in their 60s.  Great to see how many of them are so active.  Some who blasted by me.  If you time it right, you'll get to see people practicing archery, triathlon groups, badminton teams etc. along the way.Try and have a meal at the bibimbap restaurant (Mokmyeoksanbang) right at the start of the northern circuit.  Beautiful presentation, really good food (I ate their bulgogi bibimbap twice), super reasonable price.  They are mentioned in the 2017 Michelin guide."
55,5.0,This is an experience not to be missed. You can go to the top of the mountain by cable car or take a bus and then walk to the top. At night the view is breathtaking.  Also very romantic.  Be sure to go!!
56,5.0,Several entry points into the park. I entered from Sungnyemun gate following the walking trail. This is quite popular and even though the enterance was not as clear as it could be I didn't go wrong. It's quite a steep walk along the wall up to N Seoul Tower but some great views. You will pass Memorial hall this way and a couple of statues. I enjoyed the walk and the path was well kept and had been cleared of snow.
57,3.0,Overall a nice view. Park has good trails and steep steps. Cable car is a disappointing for the price though. It's a very large cable car that they squeeze 30+ people in with only standing room and no seats. So it's a short uncomfortable ride and if you're in the middle it's hard to get a good view
58,4.0,Enjoy the views of the city here! And recommend to come here on a weekday so it won't be as crowded.
59,4.0,"Its got an awesome view of Myeong-Dong district and several other places! Its many stairs are evenly paced so its not so bad.I started my route from Namsan 3 tunnel bus stop(cause that was where I dropped off),  you can see the peak from the bus stop. Take the angled elevator(seems like a tram to me) to the carpark area where you can choose to take the cable car or climb the stairs. You have to queue for the tickets and each cable car are packed to the max(like sardines). If you're lucky you get the window.I took the stairs, a nice slow climb allows you to enjoy the silence and surrounding. The stairs are evenly paced with straight paths so it doesnt make it so tiring. There are many benches around for you to stop and rest.  Lots of old Korean folks climbing too! The view is worthwhile!"
60,5.0,"If you're one to enjoy beautiful views, scenic strolls, quiet time and nature - This place is for you. I am happy I took the time to go up to the park and do not regret it. I cannot necessarily say this was the most exciting of places, but the trip up was worth it. Coincidentally, there was a food festival going on and I enjoyed it."
61,5.0,"The walk up might be tough as the slopes are kind of steep. There are two statues at the peak, to honour two persons who had made a difference in the nation. The view is pretty amazing. You may choose to walk down by the 'wall'. Be careful of the stone steps.I also went back at night to catch the night view of the city and Seoul Tower."
62,4.0,"Perfect for an after dinner stroll or weekend run from the city to the mountain and back, depending on where you're at. For the most beautiful showcase of fall foliage, come here during the autumn months!"
63,5.0,"Fantastic view from the tower. Great place for running! It was fairly easy to take the metro there, and I had a great run, which I combined with a trip to the tower."
64,4.0,"Getting here: I didn't get here through the conventional way of the cable car. Somehow I knew there must be another way to get there. Called the hotel's concierge for directions & they said I should take a taxi. Really ? There must be an adventurous way, and it took them a while to get back to me. There you go : Take the subway to Myeondong Stn (Line 4, Exit 3). Once you get out, you will see a bus stop. Take bus #5 & you will get to Namsan Park first, then Seoul Tower at the next stop. It's a cloudy day. So there is not much to see in the day. Didn't get a chance to walk much in the park bec it was too cold. Arrived here at close to 4pm to catch the sunset & night lights of the city. The view at sunset is lovely. Seoul Tower is quite commercialised but a good respite from the cold. Even the terrace with the padlocks for lovers feels commercialised. When the weather is better, I'd come here to walk around the park....Found out other buses that comes directly here : #2 and #3. They all connect to the city."
65,4.0,"I didnt realize how huge Seoul is until I got here and saw the view.  Catch the cable car for a different feel.. Although the cable car is very different from the typical cable cars, this one you'll be standing with around 15-20 pax to go up and down the mountain.  Other means is by walking through the walking tracks through the mountain.  From the city, there's an elevator you can ride before catching the cable car or walking to the mountain.  On top, there's lots of lovelocks that are on the fences of the mountain.  I mean LOTS of lovelocks.  you can either bring your own or you can purchase from the shops (about $8 each).  On top, there's Korean cultural shows showcasing variety of traditional dances and shows. Another attraction is the Namsan tower which has attractions in its own, food stalls, souvenir shops, the Hello Kitty World, 4D attractions, etc.  Great entertainment up top."
66,5.0,Had a wonderful time exploring Namsan Park. Wanted to get a hike in and it presented some nice vertical albeit on stairs. Seoul Tower was Ok experience - definitely touristy. Worth spending a couple hours in park.
67,5.0,"Namsam was so gorgeous dressed in yellow, red and orange. The peak of Autumn in Seoul is this week of Oct28. While the sun did not come out and it was 54 degrees F, I throughly enjoyed the hike up Namsam. The most impressive part was a little park at the bottom.. all the trees were awesome! ( see pic of map include for location). I highly recommend you take the time to hike Namsam. Takes about an hour and you can hope on and off busses if you get tired. I LOVED NAMSAM!"
68,5.0,"It's a great mountain that's located in the center of seoul. The N Tower is on the top of this mountain park. If you have enough time, recommend to climb by walk. Also, you can use the cable car 8500 KRW for round trip."
69,5.0,"Best to come here around late afternoon and stay through until early evening. Nice place to slow down the pace of your visit for a bit. Enjoy the view and greenery and city sights. There are a number of ideal spots for couples going on dates and souvenir shops as well as a selection of dining places. At the time I was there it looked like there is a newly developed section that they are still trying to fill the spaces with shops. Oh and there's also a toy showroom/museum at the base of the tower too!! It was hot at the time of my visit so chose to use the cable car. Be warned though that going down, the queue can be a bit of wait sometimes. I guess it all depends on the crowd? Overall it's worth it"
70,4.0,The park is a wonderful green space hedged on all sides by the urban sprawl of Seoul. at the top is the Namsan (North) Seoul Tower with fantastic panoramic views. Anyone feeling unable to take the steep walk can use the cable car or go by bus
71,4.0,"Park is must see and best enjoyed at sunset - night time, great for a walk with spectacular views of Seoul. Gets very busy on weekend nights and the line for the cable car can be 45min + as there is only 1 car (you can walk up faster than this). Views from the cable car aren't even that good and you might not get any view if you are in the middle of the car. Short on time or can't be bothered waiting for a cable car? Walk if it's nice or just get a taxi up."
72,5.0,I was surprised how spacious and green Seoul is. This park is a big part of Seoul's outdoor lifestyle. It's great.
73,5.0,"I felt very safe walking here each morning of a business trip. Natural planting, interesting historic sites and a little bird life. An oasis in the city buzz."
74,5.0,Most of the locals go there for there daily exercise. There a police officers in area to help you get there. But you must be physically shape to get up there.
75,4.0,I came when it was during sundown. Witnessed the beautiful Seoul's sunset. Recommended to come during the sunset hours where nightfall was taking place and the city lights grew into prominence. A good place to just relax into the night. Go up to Namsan Tower and see the full view of the city from the sky.
76,5.0,"Some friends and I hiked for 3-4 hours at Namsan Park last weekend and we had a blast! It is a great place to enjoy nature and get a work-out along the way. Some areas of the park are very hilly and could be challenging for some people. We would recommend wearing comfortable shoes with grippy soles. Visitors can enjoy lots of lovely water features in the park like ponds, fountains, and small streams. It is a very convenient park to get to from Itaewon. We will definitely return to spend more time in this peaceful place!"
77,5.0,"The park is very large surrounding a mountain that includes historic monuments, statues, museums, an observation tower, many trails, and a gondola in case you don't want to walk up the mountain.  I only managed to see about 1/4 of the park."
78,5.0,"i did enjoy taking a path to the N-tower through the park. Although not an easy route, it was a nice change to the crowded streets of Seoul. Better buy water at the hill's foot, or bring it with you - the only water fountain i have discovered was at the top. And before you get there, quite some water will be lost."
79,5.0,Visited during the day! Fantastic 360 degree views of Seoul.  Quirky things to look at like the love padlocks. Inexpensive activity. I took the bus up from myeong dong area then short walk (5 min) up to very top which was significantly cheaper than the cable car! Don't need to go up the tower to get great views either!
80,5.0,Really enjoyed the running track loop of the park. Lots of locals out running and walking too. Challenging run as hilly and in July very hot!
81,4.0,"The park itself is tranquil and peaceful. In the center of the city but at the same time high enough, and green enough to distract you from the building around you.  The wall and the moments around the grounds are great for history lovers. Bring walking shoes to make your way up the steps/path up to the N Seoul Tower. Taking the steps allows you to stop at your own leisure and take some magnificent photos of the city."
82,4.0,"I was in town for a conference and went here with some other conference attendees on the last night.  We got a cab here and that was super easy.  The wait to get on the cable car to go up was not too bad but the wait to go down took a lot longer (many other people had the same idea that night!).  We got to see the first part of the park area with all the locks (so many locks!!!) and took photos.   Then, went up to the next level of the park and the entrance to N Seoul Tower which is an extra fee, so we did not go up there.  There were a lot of people there so it was fun but a bit crowded.  Got a lot of great pics of the city at night!!!"
83,3.0,"Namsan Park is up on the hill and if you plan to take a walk to the park, make sure you prepare your legs. It's worth going to see the city from above, especially at night. To take a better view, you may want to go to N Seoul Tower."
84,4.0,Namsan park is very attractive in terms of the way its built over a hill at the top you will find N Seoul tower another Iconic and a must visit place while going to SeoulIt has got cable car that takes you on the top effortlessly For those who like to climb make sure to carry water bottleThe views of Seoul city from the top are wonderful
85,4.0,"Walked down from N Seoul tower and reached the Namsan Park, great place within the heart of Seoul where you will see part of the Seoul wall and monuments of Ahn Jong Geun's hand print and poems."
86,5.0,Nice park to go and walk you can go everyday great place make sports green everywhere streets are clean
87,4.0,I would call this a must while in Seoul (as long as it's a fine weather): you can either take the cable car or walk towards the N Seoul tower (easy walk). Above all it's a very nice place for couples (they do have discount for going into the tower instead of solo travelers). The best to go is around 4pm-5pm so you can catch the sunset there.
88,4.0,I had nothing better to do so walked few hours in there. Took something to eat and sat down to enjoy the weather and nature. I walked up to the Seoul Tower but that place was full (you can get there also by bus or the cable car) so bought more water and walked back down
89,5.0,"I didn't take the cable, I walked to the tower and it was well worth it. A temple and a village on the way made for nice discoveries."
90,5.0,"Namsan park is a popular destination for hikers and tourists alike. I took the ""Namsan Tour"" bus (#3) from Itaewon for 1,2K won up to the Tower. We passed many hikers enjoying the increasingly beautiful view of Seoul. After going up the Tower (tourist trap but still beautiful) I really enjoyed seeing all the flowers around the top of the park. Definitely worth a visit. From catching the bus in Itaewon to arriving at City Hall it was ~2hours."
91,4.0,"Gateway to the cable car and N Tower, Namsan park offers very scenic walkways and lets you see a bit of nature in a big city. A nice place to walk through on your way to the N Tower."
92,5.0,"Unfortunately I missed the cable cars as they only run at a certain time...the hike was amazing, a lot of steps but think about the calories your burning and the view at the top! Take plenty of water, sunscreen, hat and maybe a towel! If you don't hike it's still a worth going! The views are never ending. Ideally I would have got a hotel near and stayed a few days as it really is breath taking."
93,4.0,"Whether its kids who want a fun cable car ride or a couple who want to see the change of colours, Namsan Park ride will satisfy both. However steps at the top once you reach, so make arrangements for kids. There is some touristy but fun performances up there and a sense of Seoul as a valley among mountains too."
94,4.0,"since I was tired from walking to get to the cable car, i decided to get the roundtrip fare.  not disappointing tho. very good weather, the love locks were interesting. i love visiting towers, so next time I will visit again. its fun waiting for sunset. there plenty of food shops."
95,5.0,Namsan park is a steep walk up from the bottom. But worth the view when you get your backside up to the top. Follow the Seoul city wall and take a few pit stops on the way for a few photos. A great statue of the great Kim Koo stands tall. You can see Seoul tower from here and the cable car that'll get you there with ease. This attraction is free.
96,4.0,"I was stating at Grand Hyatt and it is very near. Actually Grand Hyatt destroys the beauty for city people. I went for a walk, it is winter so there was no green etc but still a nice place to walk. I like the way you can go up or just walk on the same level. Clean and nice enjoyable specifically if the weather is good."
97,5.0,"The cable cars will take you all the way to the top of the mountain and back down again.Super!Safe, clean and very well organized.A must do for a bird's eye view of Seoul."
98,4.0,This is one of many different ways you can reach N Seoul Tower. It gets rather crowded and if you're scared of heights and afraid of crowds........then you may want to find another way up.
99,5.0,"The view from Namsan Park and Namsan Tower is amazing.  If the weather is nice, spend some time walking in the park.  It was raining when I was up at the park.  But I still liked the place a lot.  Public transportation is available to get to the park.  It is quite convenient.  I took Bus No. 2 to the park and then took Bus No. 5 to go to Namdaemun."
100,5.0,"The best place in Seoul especially for lovers. The best way to visit this place is taking the cable car to the top of Mount Namsan. Going to the tower, you need to purchase another ticket."
101,4.0,Go there on a clear day and the view is much better. Took the cable car and the cable car was literally packed like sardines. The cable car was also extremely stuffy.
102,4.0,"The cable car to the tower was kind of cool, and the park was lovely with all the red, orange, yellow and some green color, really nice walking area."
103,4.0,"Namsan Park sits underneath the Seoul Tower. You can take the cable car to/from the top, but it also makes for a nice walk (if you don't mind steps!). Namsan Park provides beautiful vistas of the city, but allows you to escape the hustle and bustle and admire from afar ... much better in my opinion! You can also take a padlock and declare your undying love - you might feel left out otherwise ... you'll see what I mean!"
104,5.0,"Namsan Park is a great place to visit if you like being outdoors. You can hike, walk or cycle the winding road that circles the mountain and leads to Namsan Tower. There are several paths you can explore on the mountain. It is a great way to spend the day with friends or by yourself."
105,2.0,"I went up to Namsan Park on a Monday night specifically to see the view and take some night photographjy of the city from the Namsan Tower, which dominates the skyline no matter where you are in Seoul. Well, I needn't have bothered. Despite it being a Monday night, I had to line up for quite a while after paying my $9 to take the elevator up. During the lineup, they try to interest you in cheesy ""green screen"" photos where they take your photo and superimpose them over cheesy views of the city. When I got to the tower observation deck, I realized why. The ""observation"" deck was lit up inside with lights so bright you could barely see outside, and packed with cheap Chinese souvenirs and jelly beans and similar junk, as if that is why people waited in line. I realized right away that I had zero chance of getting a decent photo of the city (despite this being the best spot to do so.) The bored and unenthusiastic staff, along with groups of listless teens crowding most of the available space also detracted from any chance to enjoy the experience. It really was a shame, because the Tower is a great Seoul landmark, and if the management was genuinely interested in letting people use to experience the city (rather than selling jelly beans and cheap candy), it could be a great attraction. Needless to say, I will not be briging my family back for a visit. I should add that the park surrounding the tower is quite scenic, although somewhat crowded. But almost every vertical space is filled with fences covered in ""love padlocks"" put there by couples, which also obscures the view over much of the area, unless you are quite tall."
106,5.0,The walk to the top takes about 30 minutes walking. It is mainly stairs. You can also take the cable car I you prefer. If the weather is good the view from the top is great. You can realize how big Seoul is.
107,5.0,This place is very famous for both Seoul citizens and foreigners. I like to visit this place especially at autumn because it has excellent view with maple trees at that time. I usually take cable cars to the N tower for time and energy saving but some people enjoy climbing this mountain to the tower because this mountain is not too cliffy. You can eat at cafe and restaurants at N tower enjoying view and buy souvenirs and most of them are not that overpriced. This place is must a visit when you visit Seoul.
108,4.0,"nice place to go to for the view, this is where everyone places their locks on the fences. there is a nice touristy buzz around there!"
109,4.0,"Wonderful View at night. I visited Namsan Park twice, once during the day, and during the night. I strongly recommend you to visit during the night. Do not miss cable car or sky lounge."
110,4.0,"Good views of the Seoul city and surrounding area.  N Seoul Tower is located here, you can go up in the observation tower for a small fee."
111,4.0,"Even a city lover would appreciate this.  I mean, once you reach N Seoul Tower, you'll get to see how beautiful Seoul is.  It's a nice rewarding walk.  But I would only recommend walking if you haven't shopped all day in the surrounding neighborhoods lol."
112,5.0,"quiet, beautiful and nice place. walk all the way to the N tower. started from the south korea house to namsam park and toward N tower. all the way have signboard showing you the road. don't worry, wont get lost."
113,4.0,"Besides the Namsan Tower there really isn't anything that sets this park apart.  It is more natural than cultivated and has few other structures.  Parts of the restored Seoul wall are neat, but the best part is Seoul Tower.  Don't expect any flat terrain here.  It's either up or down."
114,5.0,"beautiful park. Try walking up to the  Namsan tower. breathtaking view, especially during sunset... More fun to walk up!"
115,5.0,"I took the cable car to the top of the hill and was rewarded with great views, some regional history information and some great people-watching.  A cultural dance and martial arts display was performed, and there was lots of shopping and places to eat.  I stayed far longer than planned, and enjoyed my visit (and a little break from the chaos of the busy city)"
116,5.0,"If you have time and it is nice outside, I would say not to miss this. You can take the various hiking paths they have and you'll see some nice sights, a beautiful shrine along the northern path, and you can even hike along the Seoul Fortress Walls. I spend a few hours just wandering the various paths here and would do it all over again."
117,4.0,"What a lovely park to visit, even at the end of winter time. So much to see with a lot of great views of Seoul to be had. Nice place to spend a few hours."
118,5.0,"Small park with a high peak (265meter). Historical, easy to walk, sports area and nice view all above Seoul. Worth going!"
119,5.0,"It's really nice to come up here and see the view of Seoul city, and it's so quiet and calm!"
120,4.0,"What I dislike is always the parking or the lack thereof, but at the same time I love how inexpensive parking is.  Don't miss the cable car or a ride on the elevator to the Namsan Tower.  Also don't forget to take many of the walking trails available."
121,4.0,"This placxe has many romantic spot to take pictures as lovers, it can get so depressing if you are here alone. :) But it a nice place to have 260 view of seoul, watch the sunset and see seoul's night time skyline."
122,4.0,"You can take the cable car up to this landmark but it's more fun (if you're up for it) to walk up the zig zag path that leads to the top of this hill from which (on a clear day) you can see for miles. It's definitely worth it (again, particularly if the weather is cooperating)."
123,3.0,The statues and old city wall were interesting. The park is located on a significant hillside and some exercise will be had just by walking around the park. I suggest walking through the park on your way to the N Seoul Tower attraction.
124,5.0,"Afternoon visit, when the sun sets or during the golden hours is most preferred. I suggest to use cable car going up then hike back down just before sunset.Great city view on Autumn contrast."
125,4.0,"An excellent place, quite, scenic, plenty of space, a museum, cable car link to go to Seoul Tower.Many people who have no access nearby to a garden, use this place for brisk morning walk or jogging."
126,5.0,"Gorgeous trees and INCREDIBLE view of city. Easy to get to top (either walk or use Cable Cars.... I chose Cable: D ) And there's online instructions how to get up the top from Subway. There were drummers performing at the entrance to the tower when I was there, really great atmosphere. Amazing place."
127,5.0,"I took cable car (pay 8,000 won- return trip)  & need to climb up slope & stairs....when reach up their you could viewing beautiful scenery & get some fresh air up there...love this place so much!"
128,3.0,"it is more beautiful in the upper part, the most important thing is easy to walk, clear sights and great facilities"
129,4.0,The views of Seoul from the park are excellent BUT the climb is very steep and probably a bit dangerous for older people or people not in the best of shape.   Well worth the work however.
130,5.0,Hiking & cable car then impressive view make everybody’s day . Cable car return is 8.5$ or 8500 Won . don't want ? you can save money and hike to the top or buy one way ticket .
131,5.0,From the park at the foot of the N Seoul Tower as well as from the top of the tower there is a wow view of the metropolis. Just pray for good weather.
132,4.0,"Namsan (san means mountain) is a mountain in the middle of Seoul and its park is a forest park in the heart of the city. Hence, it is a gift from heaven for the people of such a large and crowded city. It is very suitable for hiking. You will be delighted to see the city view while climbing. But don't climb too fast and/or without taking breaks. If not, you will sweat so much when you reach the Seoul tower at the top."
133,4.0,"This is well worth a walk. The day I went the cable car had an incredibly long queue, so if you're reasonably fit, I'd recommend you walk up. Good views up the top and cool to see things like all the locks that couples attach to the fences."
134,4.0,went there with my friends. and there you can see the locks on the decks and this place is mainly a heaven for lovers. from couple seats to couple hanging locks to proclaim their loves. a must go if you are comeing with your other half.
135,4.0,"Hike the various trails from the base of this mountain in the centre of Seoul and enjoy the views. Take the time to explore and mingle with the locals who use the trail and the outdoor gymnasiums along the way. There are a few ""photo islands"", which are viewing platforms from which you can see Seoul."
136,5.0,"Very scenic and serene park, with families or couples or dog owners just having their day in the park. I enjoyed my time walking here, the only thing I didn't like so much was finding myself at N Seoul Tower with throngs of buses and tourist crowds - didn't bother going up the tower since it was so crowded!"
137,5.0,"Everything was great. I totally have to come back. The view is worth the walk and the fee. There's food, bathroom, suveniers there as well"
138,4.0,Stone throw  away from my hotel. A great place to take an early walk or late afternoon. People are strolling leisurely and exercising at the same time. Fall season and spring be the time to visit this park. Blazing fall colors. Then you can walk up the stairs to the tower or take the tram.
139,5.0,"Super beautiful view is waiting for you on top of the tower. :) It might be crowded, but bear with the crowd. Enjoy the view. :) They have got some beautiful postcards to sell in the tower and postage service is available too. Bring your love lock to Namsan Park and lock it there if you are in relationship :D"
140,4.0,This one is for you then. Namsan Park is located on a mountain and it`s difficult to get there if you start from wrong metro station (like I did). Try the way from Namsangol Hanok Village. It`s anice Park to workout. You won`t need a gym. Just go there :)
141,4.0,"This place feels peaceful. However I went here in summer and I am a sweaty person, so I didn’t got to enjoy the place so much. But I guess walking in this park in cooler season would be very enjoyable."
142,4.0,"Theark is really beautifull! If you came around spring theres a lot of flowers.its also a good place to buy some souvenir from Seoul, since Namsan is also one of the iconic attaction in SeoulPs : Dont forget to bring your lock and write your love messages!"
143,5.0,"check out the free taekwondo show ! i dont know the schedule but they have it every week... u can even practice with them if u apply beforehand....the park is really nice, but the dance performances of the korean tradicional dancing and the taekowondo are the best !"
144,5.0,"Namsan Park is a must go during spring season. As you stroll along the park you are able to see the beautiful full bloom Cherry Blossom and other flowers bloom. Sum up, give a splendid sight of colorful scene. I stroll up from Namsan Park to N.Seoul Tower. It's totally worth it and at the same time save $ for the cable car. If you're tired after the tower view, you can take a cable car down to the Main station. Cable car cost: 6000won. Overall, best to stroll with the family, couple, and friends."
145,4.0,"I walked to the Namsan Park area from my hotel in Myeongdong, which in itself wore me out – even before the climb had started! I did see signs on the road directing traffic to Mount Namsan and it seems that it is a very popular spot for locals as well as tourists throughout the year.At the bottom of the mountain there were lovely manicured gardens and ponds, as well as the usual buses picking up and dropping off many tourists. Namsan Park is much larger than I thought it would be, offering many hiking trails around the mountain, rather than just a basic up and down route.Lovers lock keychains and padlocks on the railings at the top of Mount Namsan as if to solidify their unbreakable love to each other. I can only imagine how many of those padlocks are now present. A lot of lovers and young Korean couples come to Namsan for a romantic trip and it is a tradition for people to leave a padlock (but I have no idea where you would buy one).There were many people at the top of the mountain, many of whom had come to get even higher, by going up Namsan Tower. I did not go up myself, as I did not have enough Korean Won with me to pay the entrance fee. However, I envy the views that people must have had from even higher up there!At Namsan Park there is also a Cable Car which can take you up and down if you don’t want to brave the walk yourself physically. I am proud to say that I walked up and down, and didn’t use the cable car but it is completely free to use. My ultimate recommendation would be to walk up and get the cable car back down again. That way you get the best of both worlds. Although, the walk up Mount Namsan is strenuous, rest assured that aside from some rigorous exercise you will be left gobsmacked by the views and the overall experience. There are nice flora and fauna on the way up."
146,5.0,the most amazing view of seoul that u can have !!! just perfect !!! .... dont go in bad weathe .... or u will miss the view !!
147,5.0,Loved hiking in the park.  Great city views.  Interesting historical sights.  A great hiking pace but a very difficult hike to the top but worth it.
148,5.0,"Namsan Park is just a short walk away from the Namdaemun market and yet it feels so peaceful. There are bitumen tracks for running and many people walk there dogs there also. You can take the cable car to get to the Tower, or just walk along to the East to reach the Namsangol hanok village (a preserved village with traditional houses). Returning to Myeong-dong felling super refreshed and energised! It's particularly nice in autumn with the yellow gingko leaves."
149,4.0,"Was trying to find somewhere else and ended up here, could have been worse. It's very large and took me sometime to find my way out of."
150,4.0,"Smack in the middle of the city, is this beautiful, outdoor, spacious park.  You can spend hours walking through the park and climbing to the top of the mountain.   The park is spotless, and although many people utilize it, it never seemed crowded.  The views as you climb the mountain are gorgeous.  I really, really enjoyed hiking to the top of the mountain and stopping at the library on the way."
151,5.0,"since im in Korea, Seoul.. i really love go to park and enjoy it.. namsan park is really clean~ i relax in namsan park after walking.."
152,5.0,"I've visited the Seoul tower in spring, summer, autumn, and winter weather. Autumn is my favorite winter can be extremely hazardous to walk due to the ice on the steps. I believe it's open all night as I have run up as early as 6 am and as late as 11 pm. I must say that if you can walk up through the park to the Seoul tower do it! I've taken the cable car just for the experience and it's overcrowded and really anticlimactic. The walk up and down will give you freedom, unparalleled views of the city, and a non-crowded path up and down to and from the Seoul tower. Pay attention to where you entered and go back the same way - at the base of the hill it's a LONG WALK around if you use a different path. It's a great time!"
153,4.0,"Seoul is said to have lots of parks, but I decided to visit this one due to its large area and attractions. I took the subway line 4 and stopped at Hoehyeon Station. Too bad I took the wrong exit gate! I should've made my way to exit 1 but I went to exit 5 so it took quite some time to figure out the way to exit 1. From the exit gate (1) it still took a long way (around 1.5-2 km) to walk to Namsan Oreumi (an inclined escalator to go halfway up to the mountain). Really, running shoes are must-have items if you plan to visit Korea. The inclined escalator itself was an exciting attraction (where else could I have seen one?) and I was lucky not to queue too long that afternoon.They say it's possible to walk through the top, but since my feet started to feel sore, I decided to take the cable car. It costed quite much, but when else would I visit this place? So I bought the return tickets. The terminal was on the 3rd floor (bad news for my feet) and I almost lost my guts when I took the car. It was definitely not recommended for those of you who are afraid of extreme height. But finally I could enjoy the ride. Oh, and the staffs there were quite friendlyIt seemed that I still needed to walk upstairs (yes, there were stairs) to reach N Seoul Tower and other attractions (bad news again for my feet) so I had to stop in a small park along the way (thank God there were benches!). The view was beautiful, even if you haven't reached the top. When I reached the top, I decided not to visit the Teddy Bear Museum and observation deck of N Seoul Tower due to the limited time. However, I walked around and had the look at the love locks around it. Since I didn't bring any lock (and my significant other, of course) I could only took some photographs of them. The park is definitely worth a visit. Since I came on summer, I could see flowers of various colors in the park and beautiful green forest that surround it. But perhaps it will be more beautiful if you visit it with your loved ones ;)"
154,4.0,"I took the tourist bus there, and then took the elevator to the top. It offers a nice view of Seoul. But it does not leave a deep impression, partly because there are these kinds of towers in major cities in many countries. They are very similar in design and style. Remember the Eiffel Tower?"
155,3.0,"Had a great time once I got to the park, but was taken advantage of by a taxi driver trying to get there.  After taking the bus to the general area of the park I was unaware of how to get up the hill to the park entrance.  I hailed a cab who ended up taking me several kilometers around the city, thinking I didn't know what he was doing.  He thought I was lost and was an easy target.  He dropped me off nearly the same spot as I hailed him.  The park entrance was actually just a few thousand meters.  Luckily I'm not intimidated by these sorts of things so I gave him the minimum fare about 2 bucks and jumped out of the cab.  He was trying to charge me 13,000 won!  He had met his match though."
156,4.0,"I climbed up the hill in the sweltering heat rather than taking the cable car. It is not that long in reality, but just felt like it given the summer climate. The views from the top are interesting, but pick your day and time to make sure the visibility is sufficient, otherwise it may be pretty hazy."
157,3.0,"I went on a weekday morning before 9AM so it was rather quiet which was good. Lovely in places but the walk to the top is a long a road, or maybe I just missed the path, so not all that exciting. But for a city park it does pretty well and a great place to get out of the city for relative peace and quiet.There must be a connection with the nearest part of the Fortress Trail somehow but I only found an indirect route to do that. That would be worth further investigation."
158,3.0,"Well, its pretty much just a hill in Seoul where you will get great views, so remember to bring your camera, but otherwise, its just another tourist attraction."
159,4.0,Had a nice walk to the top. Bit crowded but a nice little hike to the top with great views over both sides of Seoul - over the Han River and back north. There is a section at the top with thousands of lovers padlocks - amazing.
160,5.0,"I am lucky that I live within walking distance of Namsan Park.  There are manicured paths for those that like them and there are also some more through the woods paths, which I prefer.  In the spring the flowers are beautiful all over the mountain.  In the autumn the colors are worth the walk."
161,4.0,Good to go up b cable car and walk down on the return journey. Lots of steps to tackle but was worth the effort to stop and smell the flowers and enjoy nature! And the clean air!
162,5.0,"Yes there is cable car that will take you to the top and there are performance up there, but the best way to explore this oasis of the concrete jungle is to get up early and do whatt the local does, hike around, do the exercise, climb up to the top (1000 steps), enjoy the view, go into the temple and have a snack in the tea house, you will better enjoy it that way and it is good for your health."
163,5.0,"Another great place to see Cherry Blossoms in full bloom , just lucky It was sunny when I went up ;)"
164,4.0,"A place to exercise and if you are adventurous enough, walk/job all the way up mount namsan to enjoy the panaromic + bird eyes' view of many tourist attractions such as myeongdong, namdaemun, insadong, etc"
165,5.0,This is a must! - mingle with the 100's of locals walking in Namsan park enjoying the views - the incredible tree planting scheme to maintain the forest and the various amenities along the tracks.
166,5.0,Nice little neat park! Very dog friendly. Well manicured and away from the bustle. Right across from the Hyatt Hotel so good location.
167,5.0,All visitors to Seoul should start here.It  gives you the best 360 degree views of the entire city and you can see just how big Seoul really is when you go up here.  The park was covered in snow which made the trip quite lovely and I decided to walk back down instead of taking the cable car both ways.    There were a couple of cafes and places to eat at the top where I treated myself to a coffee and cake.The display of thousands of padlocks was interesting.THe walk down (about 20 minutes) I would not recommend for people who don’t like steps but apart from that it was very easy and the park was pretty.
168,4.0,"It's worth a visit for a number of reasons: (1) offers a great view of the city by night -- set out by cable car around 4-ish, before it gets dark; (2) the short cable car ride is a fun way to get to the base of N Seoul Tower; (3) the thousands of love locks on the fences and on Christmas trees give it a romantic vibe.    It's a nice way to spend the afternoon if you have extra time on your hands.  Mix in a cardio work out by walking -- rather than taking the shuttle bus -- to the Namsan Cable Car Station at the base of the mountain.  From the Myeong-dong Shopping District, this is a 10-minute brisk walk, half of it uphill.  Once you get to the station, the cable car ride up to Namsan Park only takes 3-4 minutes.   There is no fee per se for this attraction (Namsan Park) but the cost to get there by cable car is KRW8000."
169,5.0,"If not because of the haze and small rain...The line for taking the ride was loooooooong. But it's OK, considered the line was going fast, and there were lots of people packed on one ride. The view from the park was great. And I can go to the top of the tower, paying tickets... There were also walls of padlocks below the tower. It says this padlocks is to keep the relationship forever :P."
170,4.0,As I went in December I chose to do the cable car as it was a bit cold for a hike (and late!) and it was beautiful to look down on the park. If I had more time the next day I would have done a walk though it--even though all the trees were bare or near bare there was snow everywhere which made it look majestic. If you go to the park you must go to the tower.
171,4.0,"If you have enough time you may visit the Namsan Tower and Park twice, once in the day time and once at night. During a sunny day you can take good photos from ""love trees"" with thousands of colorful locks in different shapes that are attached by teenagers and lovers; also beside the tower there would be some Koreans Style dancing, signing or ceremonies free to watch. There is teddy bear museum and shop that you may enjoy it especially for teenagers. If you visit Namsan Tower at night, you can enjoy a 360 degrees night view of Seoul with sparkly lights of buildings, streets and commercial towers. The Namsan tower itself is also more beautiful at night because of glamorous blue, red, and purple lighting on it at nights. There is also a good cafeteria in first floor of the tower that you can get rest and refresh yourself  :)"
172,5.0,"I went during the sunset in autumn, and I have to say the view was breathtaking! I went up via the Namsan Cable Car and it's a really good experience. I'm afraid of height, but the cable car feels so stable you won't feel any fear at all. Plus the good view will just distract you from any fear of height. I took the teddy bear museum and observatory package, and I really enjoyed this trip to Namsan. It can be a good place for dating, but you can find families, grandpas, grandmas, friends and even solo traveler like me too."
173,4.0,"Beautiful - can't beat the view of Seoul at night. And they have Coldstone! Too bad pictures don't come out - you just have to go there yourself!In the elevator, they had you watch a weird video of you taking off into the universe on the ceiling. Other than that, awesome experience."
174,4.0,Namsan is a wooded park on a fairly steep mountain. It's a great place for hiking without leaving the city of Seoul.
175,4.0,"Namsa Park is set on and around Namsa Hill in Seoul, on which the landmark Seoul Tower can also be found. It has a quiet calmness about it, with landscaped parks interspersed with natural vegetation. Accessible from many directions, you can spend the whole day walking the ring hiking route, or enter it and leave at any point. You can thus determine exactly how long you'll be there, and how much exercise you'll get. This park offers many other attractions, including restaurants, a library, the tower and cableway to the tower, and a Korean village. Well worth exploring."
176,5.0,"well paved road and stairs to the top.  Clean and lots of places for rest stops.  if you're going with the love of your life, bring a lock to the top.  There's a long wall filled with massive amount of ""lock of love"" people have left as a symbol of their love for each other."
177,4.0,"This park is located on a hill in the middle of Seoul. It is possible to walk to the top, but I took the cable car. You can see all around the city from there. It's also possible to go up the tower, where I assume the view is even more spectacular."
178,3.0,"and I don't know how to read Korean, so what I expected to be a great walk in history turned out to be a nice hike in a nice park. It is a lovely park and many of the locals go to cool off or let their kids play around, but if you don't read Korean be pepared because all the signs and maps are in Korean, so you will have a hard time figuring out where thing are."
179,3.0,"Namsan Park is worth visiting, but not essential for the visitor with limited time. It is a welcome green lung in the centre of Seoul and buses ply there regularly. It offers a nice view, but only if it is not too hot or too cold. There was a lot of mist when I visited, so the view was limited. Perhaps I went too early in the morning. If you are more adventurous, jog there from your hotel."
