0,5.0,"I loved this tour. The steep inclines and quaint houses and shops is reminiscent of our tour in Tuscany (on much smaller scale). So picturesque, I can understand the attraction for tourists. But I sympathize with the residents having to put up with us taking selfies in their doorways. We only stayed for about 30 minutes. It’s a real look into the history of South Korea."
1,4.0,"This is a good place if you want to know what Korean culture is like. They have a replica of a Korean village with the traditional furniture. There were demonstrations of Korean activities, ranging from Korean toys, make Korean rice dumplings and a Korean tightrope walker."
2,2.0,"We stayed in Tmark hotel which was just opposite this village and we thought we could just come over to see what it has to offer.  But found that the old buildings were converted to teahouse, shop, etc and the place is connected to a big park.  Did not explore further as we had time constraint."
3,5.0,I found this beautiful traditional village across the street from our guesthouse in Seoul. It has 5 restored Korean traditional houses. The village is not to big but has a beautiful scenery with autumn leaves from the trees. This is as perfect as Bukchon village or Korean Folk Village if you are looking for traditional instagrammable pictures and not crowded too. Entrance is free and also has autumn festival for foreigners. We attended one last Oct 27 of this year. The village also has a path to Namsam park. This village can be found on Chungmuro Station exit 3 or 4 just look for the signages. This place is lovely!
4,3.0,Went in mid June close to noon time and it was a bit sunny. Temperature was still a cool 27 deg C so it was ok to walk around. The scenery is nice and is good for taking some photos but otherwise nothing very interesting.
5,4.0,I have been in Seoul several times and never made it to this Traditional Garden and Hanok Village. A local Korean friend of mine discovered it with me on a nice Sunday afternoon. It is only about a ten minute walk from the Catholic Cathedral.
6,4.0,Even a grey day could not influence the experience at this place. Two facts helped a lot. Paper lanterns with great figures brightened the impressions there. And there was a foto shooting for an egagement which gave life to this place :-)
7,4.0,"This village is much better than I expected! I heard from other people it was pretty much traditional houses and nothing too special, but I have to say I really liked it and would visit again. The architecture is impressive and village is quite big. You can really have a feeling of how people used to live in the ancient times in Korea. They also have a nice gift shop with beautiful and original gifts."
8,3.0,Very nice place you can see all traditional houses but unfortunately very small town you can finish it less than half hour
9,3.0,"I walk here from Namdaemun Market. This is such like small village with traditional Hanok Village. If you go to Or before go to Namdaemun, please have a visit at this area to take a photo. It will not take a long time."
10,4.0,"First you don't have to pay to visit this nice place. You can see many Korean traditional home, and there are some performance you can enjoy in the evening. You can even dancing with the performers. There are also some spot where you can try some Korean traditional game here."
11,4.0,"Went during their taste of korea, that had samples of eats, drinks, and carving demos.  Pretty neat experience.  Got some goodies to try and take home."
12,5.0,This is a great place to visit as historical house have been moved into this lovely park setting.There is a tea house and many places to admire the garden like setting. I loved having the time wandering among the ancient houses.
13,3.0,"My friends and I stopped by this place on our way down from Seoul tower. Tranquil surroundings,  but without activities or sufficient signboards in languages other than Korean, it is just a location with  traditional houses"
14,4.0,This place  is a replica of old traditional Korean villages. The entrance area is like a park and inside there is a ticket counter and a cafeteria. One can buy tickets for hiring traditional Korean dress and having a photo shoot in it for one complete hour. Overall a good place to spend time knowing abt the old Korean era and their lifestyle.
15,5.0,"Being situated at Chungmuro station exit 3, this place is very convenient. There are various activities to take part in each day (check out the schedule when you are there) eg archery. There is small cafe inside where you get a discount for the drinks if you are in hanbok. Much to explore inside which I have not finish despite the fact that it is not big. There's even a small temple at the entrance. This place is also near The KoreaHouse where traditional performances are held."
16,3.0,"I gave this place a 3 star rating because we didn't get the full ambiance of this visit. Due to a holiday in Seoul, many of the venues were closed but we managed to walk around the grounds.  If you're in Seoul for a very short visit this place would be good to visit because you can probably see it all of it within an hour or two. I wouldn't mind visiting this place again while it is  in full operation."
17,4.0,"I know that Bukchon Hanok Village is popular among toruist. But this is the place where you can see traditonal korean house and learn some korean history. It looked like an excellent place to do many traditional korean stuff like caligraphy and tea ceremony. When I went there, they provided us the opportunity to enter the house and 'take a nap'. Usually, you are bared from entering.If I had the time, I would rent a Hanbok and take some pictures here. It's nicer to wear a hanbok here and take pictures compared to taking pictures at the palaces."
18,5.0,"Great place to visit for any type of traveller. I has lots of fun there, tried traditional costumes, have taken fantastic shots of traditional buildings, the parks are amazing."
19,5.0,"This is a must see for a first timer in Seoul Korea.  We went here first hour in the morning.  Had our breakfast at a resto nearby.  At the entrance we were greeted by a volunteer student tour guide, it was a free and good to learn more about the culture from a local.  We were able to experience their games.  It felt like we were in a Korean Drama featuring old Korean era.  Overall, we had fun and highly recommended."
20,5.0,This place is walking distance from the train station. The traditional Korean garden will welcome you as well as the view of Namsan Tower. The Korean traditional houses have been restored to preserve the original atmosphere of the area. It is ncle to try hanbok and take pictures at different locations here. It is not tiring to go around unlike the other palaces and hanok villages.
21,3.0,"This place is near to our accommodation so basically we just walk to go there. If you are using subway,  stop at chungmuro station,  exit not sure. The layout of this place is just ok for me. You can see a few hanok for a few different rank. We go there twice,  the first time to visit,  and the second time is to   try their hanbok. After surveying for a few days at a few location,  we figure out that at this hanok village,  we can wear hanbok at krw 10,000 for 1 hour. Other places range around krw 18,000 to krw 20,000. The hanbok is beautiful enough so no complaint. Just that you need to be there early,  if not - maybe you have to wait for quite some times before your can try it out. Just a reminder,  before you enter this place,  there will be a shop just outside this place that also rent hanbok. If you don't mind paying higher it is ok. But thekrw10,000 per hour hanbok that I'm talking about is inside the hanok village"
22,5.0,"We had a wonderful guide who was in the eighth grade!  Harry was his name!  He volunteers once a month to help tourists navigate their way through the village.  He was up on his history which made the village more enjoyable to visit!!  He was very knowledgable and most courteous!  Fabulous village, warm people, and a delight to visit!"
23,4.0,When we visited this place you will be reminded of the Koreanovelas. The place is clean and so relaxing to stay at.
24,4.0,"This place wasnt closed on Chinese Lunar Year eventhough many places were closed.  In here you could see beautiful Korean traditional village.This place had Lunar Year Festival and there were some events for tourist who came here, such as - free rice cake- making of sweet rice puffs- making of mask and kite- traditional korean show (percussion, arts, etc)- traditional korean gameSome of the events were free, you can see my photo to know more.So visit here, if you dont know what to do in Seoul on Lunar Year."
25,4.0,It's just another old-style village in Korea. It's just 10 minutes walking from Myeong-dong. Best hour to go: after 6 p.m. (it will be night and empty!).
26,4.0,"Visit on a weekend when there is a planned wedding in progress. The houses are of an older period and give a free taste of the authentic Korean culture,"
27,5.0,"Though we visited it towards evening, we could find the architectural beauty of the houses  quite fascinating. The winding climbing narrow lanes take you into another world to feel the difference. There is beauty in every angle. We wish we could visit and explore the whole area. One should visit this area to experience the Korean peaceful past. Though we were prevented to to take photographs outside some houses. You get Mobile Information centres here which is a very rare thing."
28,3.0,"The place was a lot smaller than what I had imagined. Not a lot to see, but a great location to take pictures. Go here before you head to Namsan Tower."
29,5.0,"It was at the end of my Seoul stay, that I still hadn't visited any hanoks, so I suggested my Korean penfriend to go and check it out, after picking up a brochure in the Tourist Information Office. (She hadn't heard about the place before, either!)It was my best idea and the highlight of my visit. It's beautiful and charming! If you have the time, I suggest you plan to spend some time there and just enjoy the environment.We visited on a Saturday, but relatively early, before 11, so there weren't too many people.You can participate in various programmes and there's a traditional wedding ceremony every 2 hours, at 11, 1pm and 3pm. These are real weddings, not re-enactments!You have to pay a fee for the activities/workshops - prices vary, but attending the wedding and visiting the village is free.If you need to pick up some traditional gifts, the gift shop is excellent."
30,4.0,This place may sound like its similar to the Bukchok Hanok village but its not even close. This plase is more similar to a temple complex than a village. It got several old housings and gives a nice insight in old korean living.
31,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how few people were at this village, it's a great walk through.  We did not venture into the garden, as it was far too hot/humid, but really enjoyed the opportunity to see historic Korean buildings.Great place to visit and gain some education about historic Korea.  And, it's free!!"
32,4.0,Nice village to have a look around on how the old traditions were and how they built their villages. Well maintained and with information in english as well.
33,5.0,"It is a shame that it is in a difficult place to find. Looks like someone is hiding it, but when you go in, you find a beautiful treasure."
34,4.0,"This hanok village is right near Myeong-dong at the base of Namsan mountain. You can wander around the small village to see how people lived in the past or even have your photo taken in Korean traditional dress. Then you can walk around the adjacent park. It makes a very pleasant respite from the frenetic pace of the nearby city.  You only have to pay if you want to do the optional activites (eg; Hanok dress), otherwise it is free.  Arrive early or at lunchtime when the tour groups are not around, to avoid crowds."
35,5.0,"The village looks very well maintained and it gives an insight of the way people live in the olden days in Korea. The complex is actually very big and it comprises not only the village, but also a large park. Definitely worth a visit."
36,4.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village is a Village of Traditional Houses in the Namsan Valley, it is a Korean village located in the area of Pil-dong neighborhood in Jung-gu, a central district of Seoul, South Korea where hanok or Korean traditional houses have been restored to preserve the original atmosphere of the area.The Namsangol Hanok Village offers one the opportunity to experience a wide cross-section of Joseon-era citizenry and activities, from royalty to commoners. A great effort has been made to accurately furnish each dwelling with appropriate era and social status appointments."
37,5.0,"Historical sites of traditional village of old era. Seeing and experience the life with historical building and artifacts, beautiful scenic views and ponds. Social activities conducted here as well by school and other organizations. One way of introducing Korea to foreigners."
38,5.0,"After seeing 3 palaces it was nice to finally see how the regular people used to live. The village is free, close to metro and the N Tower cable car. It's best to see in the evening to catch it both in the day light and after susnest when all the lanterns are lit"
39,5.0,Five houses remain in this village set in a large area within the busy city of Seoul. It is a major tourist attraction and gives a good idea of traditional architectural styles.
40,5.0,"Must see place, right in center of the city of Seoul. Great scenery and authentic  houses on the hills. Nice attraction to visit when in Seoul"
41,5.0,"Hanko is the Traditional House's name of Korea. You can enter this house and see the rooms, furniture. Also can experience the traditonal games. Sometimes you can see the traditional music performance at this place. You can go to the N Seoul Tower from hear."
42,5.0,Just 3 mins walking distance from subway. Some tradition Korean games are provided in the middlr of the park. A place for chill...
43,4.0,i discovered this place when i was walking to Myeong-dong.i quite this place and it just under the N Seoul tower.it has tea room and time capsule too.
44,4.0,English and chinese free guided tour is available. Easily located at chungmuro exit 3/4. Pretty structure . They have a time capsule garden at the back which is worth a visit.
45,3.0,"After spending a wonderful afternoon at Lin An Tai historical house and museum in Taipei the previous year, I was looking for a similar experience.  This was not it.  Unlike Lin An Tai, there was very little information provided on site at Namsangol, and nearly nothing provided to explain the style, age, and architectural influences of the collected homes, nor what the individual rooms in the home would have been used for (other than an occasional note about a main room or a temple.)  I suspect that this lack was not only in English, as the number of signs was very limited.  It's a pretty area, surrounded by a very metro neighborhood, so might be nice for pictures, but I would have rather spent my time at something truly interesting and historically informative."
46,3.0,"Another option in Seoul to see more examples of Korean architecture, especially if you don't want to navigate the alley ways and climb your way to the Bukcheon Hanok Village.This tourist attraction is usually quite busy, especially during the warm months. On weekends it's overrun with tourists and weekdays with school children as many school have picnics and field trips here. However, if you want a chance to take more pictures of Korean style houses, it's at least worth a stop by."
47,4.0,"it's free admission, if you have a few hours to kill, make a visit.good for photos, and get to know how the Korean houses look in the past.Walking distance to Insadong."
48,4.0,It has 5 Joseon-era houses that have been restored.  Volunteer guides are available during the weekends who can give more details about the houses.  The park surrounding the area is a nice place to relax.  One of the better free attractions in Seoul.
49,4.0,"Love the village. There's also food festival when I went there, and I get to try making some of their traditional sweets for free. There's demos for making traditional clothes and so much for. In all, there's a lot to see here."
50,4.0,yes there is such a traditional korean place at the nearby town and only few walks away from the highway and subway. it's great walking around and having a somewhat experience of the tradional korean lifestyle
51,5.0,"I visited Namsangol Hanok Village a beautiful October day when weather was great. Saw an amazing taekwondo show, walked the tranquil park. Sat in the sun and watched the nice colors of the trees preparing for fall. Not many people. Great if whether is good. I spent 2 hours here.Also strolled around the traditional houses. The had different traditional activities to try, like dress up in traditional Korean clothes. Didn't try any of that. Really nice place if you want to get away from the buzz in the big city!"
52,4.0,"The Hanok Village is a collection of traditional Korean houses which have been moved onto a complex and rebuilt as they had been. It gives a fascinating insight into how Korean families lived in the past.We went at a quiet time in the village, around 16.30/17.00 so there were few people around but there was no food or drink place open despite the normally long opening hours of the café!"
53,3.0,"This place is small. We expected expected a bigger Hanok Village with real living people in it like in Hoi An, Vietnam. By the way, it's free and this is our first Hanok Village visit in our life."
54,3.0,"Our hotel was nearby so we strolled around for few hours. You get nice pictures here and it's free, but there's not that much to do around the hanok village. Few pretty nice cafes here and there but not much more, worth going for the ""old village""- type of pictures though."
55,2.0,"Our next stop was the Namsangol Hanok Village. By the time we found it, it was high noon and it was too scorching hot for my liking and I admit, I was acting like a spoiled brat. The village was literally close to the N Seoul Tower which made for a great photo opportunity, but other than that I would not recommend this as a must-do when visiting Seoul. Heck, when we got there we just sat on a rock under shade for about 30 minutes pretending to soak in the serenity and beauty of the area, when in reality our foot was sore and probably blistering."
56,3.0,Admission is free. Good cultural experience where u get to know how the traditional people lives in Korea. Can wear Korea Traditional Clothes and take pictures
57,5.0,"Visited this place prior to going to N Seoul Tower since the bus station to Namsan is nearby. Spent almost 3 hours to take photos, the place is soooo beautiful! :)Take a walk further and discover the time capsule where the present-day artifacts are buried."
58,5.0,The houses there are of very traditional style and are very clean and with good condition. Not many people there and a nice place to go there. We spent about two hours for visiting there. The nearby place has many good restaurants
59,4.0,If you stay in the center of Seoul and don' t have the time to travel outside Seoul. Then make sure to come here! Like everyone else says it's a time machine and it educates you about a time long lost. Come here when it's not rainy and hopefully not chilly!
60,5.0,"I think that visiting this village is good for newcomers. It is a little village, consisting of five  traditional korean houses. I liked this place because of the atmosphere and nature around. By visiting this place I have learned a lot about Korean culture, how  and where they used to live, what they used to do. Was lucky to see the traditional wedding ceremony with musical accomponiment and try Hanbok, korean traditional dress. It costs 10 000 won for 30 minutes. Even in the evening this place is opened, and my advice is to visit it when there are not so many tourists."
61,5.0,"This reminded me of an ourdoor museum we visited in Hanoi where traditional houses were exhibited.  The structures were in excellent condition and some of these were being used for cultural shows.  During our visit, some areas were closed because of such shows and there were even some pictorials going on.  We visited in the late afternoon and were not able to see some attractions becasue ticket selling was already closed."
62,5.0,Love to walk thru the Village and enjoy the traditional Korean architecture. When you walk down the hill or before going up there are many good shops and restaurants in the area.
63,4.0,"I went there by the time there was a festival gathering different schools from Seoul for local foods, drinks, costumes and so on; around the end of September. And it was such a great experience. Besides that, the village its self is really amazing. You can feel the millenarian traditions right in the middle of the bustling Seoul. However, the city is crowded with other villages and temples, so if you are in a hurry, I would recommend other attractions rather than Namsangol Hanok."
64,5.0,Visitors can participate in traditional Korean activities such as archery and enjoy traditional Korean performances as well.
65,5.0,"Whoever that wanted to experience the Korean Culture, you should go to this Village. Especially for ladies, you should try to wear their beautiful Hanbok ! it just cost few won for you to experience the culture. Its really cheap and worth it !"
66,4.0,"A little bit hard to find if you walk from N Seoul Tower because it's take like one or two hours to find it. Walking down the hill with no wifi (olleh egg wifi doesn't work here) is a little bit tough and some Korean doesn't know where it is. However, the minute when you walk in to this village it's totally worth! Breath-taking view and very beautiful village like any where else in Korea. Not only that but also free entrance! After visiting this place don't forget to find good Korean restaurants around subway. There is a few interesting restaurants there!"
67,4.0,"We were lucky enough to visit when they presented a Taekwondo exhibition.  An amazing half hour show. Free of charge.  Don't miss it! The village itself is interesting and pretty, but it was a hot day and the walking is hilly."
68,5.0,"You'd expect a village to be in the countryside, but not this one. The village isn't a ""natural"" village  as the houses were moved there from elsewhere. Apparently the ""Han"" in Hanok refers to the Han people who are the Koreans (they are nothing to with the Chinese Han people). The ""ok"" of Hanok means house, so they are Korean houses. The houses are from the Joseon period and belonged to quite important people. One belonged to the parents of a Korean Queen. The houses are wooden and a little raised with a few steps up. Where there are wooden floors, this were the meeting parts of the houses. However where the families actually lived have covered stone floors which had heating underneath. Outside at ground level you can see holes in the side where the fires were lit, and around the corner you might find a large chimney. I wouldn't have wanted to clean those fires out; you'd need to be a horizontal chimney sweep.The doors can be lifted up out of the way in summer to let breezes through. At the Village there is also a meeting hall set very scenically with a little lake in front and hills behind. The hills must be granite as the rock outcrops look identical to the granite outcrops of Girraween National Park in Queensland, Australia.At the entrance to the Village are full-sized models of various dignitaries, in singles and pairs. There are holes where the faces should be and you can stand behind and stick your face up to the hole to look as though you are wearing traditional garb. The toilets are just a short way behind, should you need them.Newly married or about to be married couples have their photos taken there in traditional dress. A couple was there when we were and I asked the mother/mother-in-law if it would be possible to take their photo. She readily agreed and indicated I should be in the photo too, as did the couple, who moved apart for me to stand between them. So I have a photo of a very elegantly dressed Korean couple with an Aussie traveller in shorts and dusty walking shoes. How kind was that of them!"
69,4.0,This is a great way of seeing different Korean hanok traditional houses and architecture clustered in the same place. N-seoul tower also is visible from hear. It can get little crowded at time. I had truly enjoyed this place.   The nearest subway station would be Chungmuro Subway Station. They also do have some performances if you came at the right time (unfortunately I was a little late).
70,4.0,This is a good walking trip and easily accessible by train. There is also no entrance fee. There are a lot of Korean traditional houses which are good for photo opportunities. It is also very near Gyeongbukgong palace.
71,4.0,"This is an uninhabited village that restored traditional Korean houses. It has pond, stage for frequent performances and a time capsule! You will find yourself, it just perfect place to stroll around. You can play some traditional Korean game in there if you feel like some activities. I would recommend you must see in there, Korean traditional marriage ceremony."
72,5.0,"We came very early, took some pictures then saw the sign that says wearing of Hanbok is available from 10 am for a price of 10K won and with 30 minutes to take pictures.It's a must try. For big person like me, the selection is not so many but for medium to small people, a lot of choices for Hanbok."
73,4.0,"The area is quite significant and if you are tired, rest in the old house in the front compound. The houses here are slightly different from that in the Bukchon Village - here there is the main house and surrounding quarters and you get to see inside the houses through the open doors and windows. There were demonstration of weaving baskets. The entrance to the village is free but to experience the traditional Korean way to serve and drink green tea, you have to pay. I forgot how much with all the places I had visited but I think it's about 9000KRW. We were let into one of the old houses for the ceremony.The lady who demonstrated the tea serving and drinking ceremony was cheerful and helpful though she had difficulties with English. No matter, my friends and I understood the spirit of green tea drinking in old times - no gulping down people! She also showed us how the ""cookies"" were served and we experienced how to mold the soft bean dough in a wooden mould then eat the delicious cookies. No video taping allowed, just still pictures. My  friends enjoyed it so much that they were looking for green tea after."
74,4.0,"If you're a first time traveler to Korea, it wold be nice to visit this place and take pictures. You could see traditional Korean housing and play traditional sports."
75,4.0,"I recommend this place for people who is interest in korean culture but has limited traveling time.  we can see the traditional korean houses, play with some traditional toys for free. There are some selective activities that cost not much money, you can do some korean paper work, make traditional masks, try on some lovely traditional clothing. Also I was lucky because there's a free Korean traditional medicine for foreign travellers during my visit."
76,5.0,"The Namsan Hanok Village is a great place to visit, whether you are just visiting Seoul or you live here.  It has several kinds of traditional Korean homes set up and activities in some places around.  There is also a huge time capsule park in the back of it."
77,5.0,"you will be amazed with architectures and furnitures in the hanok house. but you couldn't come inside the house and only can snap photo outside the house. one of the house also provided with Hanbok (Korean traditional dress) wear. but you have to pay KRW 3000 in order to feel the experience of wearing Hanbok. if you want to purchase souvenirs, there is a shop inside the village that can provide you with all of goodies and you only have to choose according to your budget. if you wanna know more about Korean culture, it's worth visit this place."
78,3.0,it is just a village consists of houses being rebuilt in 1990s. perhaps it would be much better if u know more about the history and the background.
79,4.0,"This was one of the highlight of my trip. I am trying to be as unbiased here as possible because the visit didn't start out well.The address that the hotel provided to the taxi driver was questionable. Although he used his GPS, we still ended up in the middle of nowhere where different people tell us different directions. If you are lost, it is best to ask the workers who owns the shop there, not working there cos most of times, they don't know where it is. One even leaded us to Namsan N Seoul Tower!! We even allocated 1 hour time frame just in case we were lost and we were still late by 15 mins. You need a local to help you reserve this. Try as I could, I could not navigate myself through their website to help me make a reservation. Luckily my hanok @ KunDaeMunJip helped me with the reservation and paid for it.We went on a Tuesday where the village was closed except for the tea ceremony. It was ok as we have earlier checked on Buckhon Hanok Village and the National Folk Museum at Gyeongbokgung. When you first step in, you will be treated to a nice cup of tea and later they will lead you to a room where you can choose your hanok which you can wear throughout your tea ceremony. It helps to come early so you can get the best choice. As we were late, I was very unhappy with my choice of hanbok. Then they will lead you outside and help you take photographs. Tip : Take it against the backdrop of the Namsan Seoul Tower behind you. They will also give you a complimentary picture after the event. Then they will bring you to a room where they will explain how to seat, how to serve, how to appreciate the tea. I love this part! You will also be served with some really really delicious rice cakes to enjoy with your tea when the music performances are held. To me, this was better than kimchi making because this helped me learn how to appreciate the Korean culture and the tea ceremony as well as the music. It was 50,000 won per person."
80,5.0,"I have been there for four times already and it's always a great place to drop by - especially on weekends because on most saturdays they have special events and performances.There is no entrance fee at the main gate and even though it's crowded you will be able to get a glimpse of the traditional houses and athmosphere of Korea.Sometimes you will get lucky and get to see a traditional wedding too (I saw one!) when a couple rents a part of the houses (just one court) but it's still open for the public.There's also a theater located inside the Hanok Village, they have some events for foreigners, such as costume (hanbok) renting and concerts."
81,5.0,"Really interesting to see time back in the past. The village is located conveniently at Chungmuro exit 3. Definitely an experience for sight-seeing. Entrance is free. On our first visit, we missed the hanbok experience and went back again on the 5th day of our trip. Worth the visit!"
82,5.0,"Two reasons to go to Namsangol Hanok Village: 1) MiSuDa and 2) Traditional Houses.MiSuDa allows you to wear Korean dress, learn some Korean words and manners, experience a tea ceremony and listen to live traditional music. I don't know where you can get all that in one place, so it was definitely a great idea to go. Some tips:1. You can't get tickets anywhere except through a Korean language website and on-site. It's not easy to walk in if you need an interpreter; we were just lucky that an American reserved beforehand so there was an English interpreter that day. We couldn't get tickets online or at Sejong Center, after four months of trying. They let us in because they felt sorry for us!2. It starts at 4 PM and ends at 6 PM (not 8 PM). I saw in a website that the activities included rice cake making -- we didn't do that.3. The teacher and the interpreters were so pleasant! They really made the experience memorable and fun. 4. No need to bring anything but money and a camera. They provide the costumes and all the ingredients for the tea ceremony. Actually, even if you don't have your own camera, they will give you a hard copy of your picture in costume.5. No parking in the area -- take public transport to get there.6. If you want something to eat or drink, you can get food and drinks at the convenience store outside the gate. Didn't see a restaurant or food stall inside the park.As for the Hanok Village -- it's free and fun. I didn't try them, but there are pay activities there, too (playing drums, crafts and the like). You do the activities in the houses (which are actual houses transported to that place, where they are viewed museum style). They also have a simple gift shop but the stuff didn't really appeal."
