0,5.0,"This was the place that made me fall in love with Seoul all over again. We visited as the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. It was one for the books - sitting at the cafe drinking coffee, and witnessing petal storms while people watching. What a gem of a park this is. At the time we went, there was a musical performance to be held there. Quite a shame we couldn't stay too long."
1,5.0,"I went to Seokchon twice in the past few weeks. I went at the end of May and then again at the beginning of June. I loved it and will surely be going again. What a gem of a place - so peaceful and pretty 8n the hustle and bustle of Jamsil. There are coffee shops right there, and also many places to have a drink or eat out around the lake just across the street. The walking path along the lake is carpeted, this the ground is rely soft and comfortable to walk on, especially for me as I just started getting back to walking after my long ankle injury (broken ankle). I love how close it is to World Tower and World Mall, yet while at the lake it doexnt even feel like being in Seoul. 100% recommending it!"

3,4.0,"I recently visited Seokchon Lake for the cherry blossom festival and found it to be one of the prettiest places in the city to see the blooms. Our group enjoyed taking photos and having a comfortable stroll on the nice, wide walking paths around the lake. We observed large carp swimming in the lake under the bridge. It was a fun afternoon and very peaceful, despite being fairly crowded for the festival."
4,5.0,"What a beautiful place to visit during the cherry blossoms season.It is a very cosy and comfortable place.  Walk around the lake is very refreshing.  Although there were lots of people, there is still lots of room. I saw people enjoy their lunch at the table outdoor under the cherry blossoms.  Such a  good idea to enjoy the lake.  It's never hard to find a place to rest, to sit down, to find washroom.  Visit the tour centre, there is friendly staff to help you navigate the area and the city.  Plus, there is Korean traditional clothes inside for you to take photos.  Good for elderly and babies on strollers Maybe you can buy a cup of coffee at the cafe at tour centre to enjoy the view.Suddenly, a breeze blew up the cherry petals. What a lovely scene of pink cherry petals rain.  I traveled with my mom.  Dear Tripadvisor, I suggest you to add  one  category,  Family ( with eldery)"
