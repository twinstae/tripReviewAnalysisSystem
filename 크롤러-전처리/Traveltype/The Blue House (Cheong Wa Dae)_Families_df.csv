All my Korean friends did not know about this free visit of their president residence.Lots of school kids accompanied by their oma (Mother) and a few tourists were in our group. The tour was conducted in Korean. We were offered an audio guide in English. I count ourselves lucky to be in such near proximity to Cheong Wa Dae. They lined us up in groups. We walked from one lane after another in the huge garden. I felt so at peace looking at the 300 hundred year-old tree and the impeccably designed landscape with many fountains. The highly alert male and female guards were all martial arts trained. I saw this big guy lifted up a seven or eight year-old boy with just one arm easily.We were given a souvenir pouch to take away which was such a nice touch.After the tour which lasted for an hour, the kids went home. We were offered the chance to tour the Chilgung Shrine (The Seven Palaces) next to the Blue House. I had planned to visit it and stayed on. Two other ladies who did not expect a further tour followed us.The shrine was dedicated to the seven concubines from the Joseon dynasty who bore sons (世子) who became the future kings. Their spirit tablets were placed in each of the seven shrine/ palace with its own name. Once escorted there, a friendly lady came out to show us around. She spoke very good English with the tour lasted a mere 15 minutes. While walking the ground of the shrine, I said to her “ah-reum-dap-da” which was to compliment it to be such a pretty and serene place. I dared not request her to open up one shrine for us to take a look inside. It would be rude to disturb the royal ladies in there.A very well spent morning in Seoul."

Keeping the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion walls (the two-story hexagonal pavilion that's currently walled up) on your right, and the Jibok-jae building in front of you, keep walking until you see a gate with guards on your left. (The gate is closest to the Jibok-jae building within the Palace, and is on the north area of the palace complex.) Go out through the gate, and you'll see a larger gate with guards on your right. You can go out to take a photo of The Blue House across the road, but be sure to keep your Gyeongbokgung entrance ticket with you as you re-enter Gyeongbokgung!"
2,3.0,"This is the Presidential palace where the first family lives and goes to office, receives important guests, etc. Security is very tight as you have to schedule way before the actual day of tour and everything you bring inside is inspected carefully. Pictures can be taken only on designated spots and you are accompanied by guards at all times. We were unlucky that a group of tweeners were in our batch and they were a rowdy bunch. The whole tour was made in Korean too so we didn't understand anything that the guide was saying. Maybe they thought that since we had a Korean friend accompanying us, he would do all the talking/ translating! I thought it was unfair to him since they should've considered the other foreigners in the group. Anyway, there is not much to see inside and no special souvenirs were given to us so we sort of just had a long walk inside the palace complex without even seeing anything inside the palace itself."
3,3.0,"If you want to take pictures and proof that you have been to Seoul and visited the Presidential Blue House, just do so. But a tour to this area ,not really worth it. Just go elsewhere."
4,2.0,"I attended this tour in DEC 2007 and JAN 2017... it has gotten worse. During the 2007 tour we were able to go very close to the Blue House and inside of the Reception building. Neither of these happened in 2017. In short it should not be called a ""Blue House Tour"" as you cannot actually tour the Blue House.I toured the White House in Washington twice (FEB 2000 & FEB 2001). It is AWESOME and 90% of the tours were inside and you could take photos more than at the Blue House (and you are outside the whole time).  In 2009 my wife and I went to the Governor Generals Estate in Canada, without schedule, and was allowed on the grounds and to walk up to the door; another AWESOME experience. It was closed that day but the guards still made it an experience better than that of the Blue House."
5,4.0,"The experience overall is good, but be prepared to have over run, especially they will ask you if you are available for an extra tour at the back of the blue house.Yea the best thing is to receive the pouch or a mug as a gift. Something that i do not like is that the ushers do not know basic english. They simply give all instructions in Korean and if you ask anything in english, they will never know what you are asking."
6,4.0,"There were many things I wish I had known going into this tour, so I hope to give future travelers some insight.You must book this tour in advance, which requires providing your passport information. I believe I booked a month or two in advance. You sign up for your desired date and time, and receive a confirmation E-mail. Security here is very tight, so I carried around a printed copy of my confirmation E-mail. The tour itself is (at the time of me writing this) completely free.You must bring your passport with you, and it will be checked many times. Arrive 30 minutes prior to your start time. I had an issue finding the designated meeting area, so let me shed some light. Upon reaching the Gyeongbok Palace, (we took Gyeongbokgung Subway Exit 5) ensure you are within the walls of the palace. Walk all the way to the East side of the compound (there are many walls and gates. I had to ask for help from two charming workers to find it.) Keep walking until you reach a parking lot. You will see a little building (I remember it being white) filled with chairs and TV screens. Go in there and wait. Closer to your departure time, your group lines up at a ticket counter, where your passport (and perhaps confirmation E-mail) are verified. Make your way to the bus (employees tell you where to go, and in my situation, all spoke English well.)The bus drives you up to a theater/guest house of sorts. You go through a metal detector, I was asked to snap a photo of the ground with my camera to prove it was a camera. What I was not anticipating was for the guides to take my passport in exchange for an English speaking audio-guide (They had other languages available, but, we were given English based on our passports.) Everybody who ""rented"" an audio-guide had their passports held for them. We were also all given badges to wear around our necks.This process takes some time. Just a warning. After all that, we are entered into a room to watch a short movie (enter audio-guide.) Then we were ushered out, told to make 2 single file lines, and begin walking along the tour. We were given a sweet gift (super thoughtful, thanks, South Korea!) and a photograph that showed where we could and where we absolutely could not take photos. This was very helpful. The sheet gave a brief description (yes, mine was in English) of what we were going to see, and also the corresponding numbers for the audio-guide. As the tour leader spoke Korean, we could listen along in our desired languages.There are about 5-6 stops on the tour, and the tour itself took about 60 minutes once we left the theater. The second to last stop is the blue house, which is truly beautiful. When the tour ended, we were given the option to see one more place, or to return our audio-guides and retrieve our passports. It had started to rain, so we opted for our passports.I have read that there is no transportation back to the Gyeongbok Palace. I followed people from my tour (who did not speak English) to a bus that brought me back to the Palace. I am not sure if I hopped on a private bus, or if due to the rain, but they did shuttle people back.Note that you are not allowed to enter any of the buildings after the guest house. You only gaze and photograph from afar.I definitely enjoyed this tour. I thought it was cool to learn about Korea's history and also their politics. There is a lot of walking required. The tour provided rain slickers as it started to rain, which was thoughtful. All in all, I am very thankful that I attended the tour, but I would not necessarily do it twice."
7,4.0,"After our walk about tour in Bucheon and having our lunch as part of our full day city tour, our guide drove us here for a short ""photo stop"".The Blue House is the official residence of the President of Korea, akin the White House of the US and Downing Street of the UK. It has a large compound with nice architectural designs that depicted its long history, politics and culture.The entire surrounding is heavily guarded with many policemen standing guard on the entire stretch of road and nearby small roads and lanes. Well, vehicles are not allowed to stop outside but walking visitors can enter it to visit the place at designated areas (but must make prior appointment and booking) and photography though allow but at some locations/public areas only.As we were rushing to our next destination, we just dropped by outside the entrance for a quick photoshop of the palace building and ground though we would have hoped to book the appointment to enter and visit it.Interesting to visit and who knows you might be lucky to see the President!"
8,3.0,We were stumbled at this place during our journey looking for Bukchon village. We did not even realize it until we saw tons of polices. There is nothing to see in this place as it's crowded and heavily guarded. We took a couple pictures of the blue house from a far at designated place.
9,3.0,"The Blue House is heavily guarded, much like our U.S. White House for the President and our tour bus dropped us off several blocks ++ away, for a morning breakfast first before walking us over to see it from a distance and for photo ops.  That's pretty much all one need, a guided tour inside will be restricted & limited for security reasons.  The House is framed behind the shadows of the mountain in the near distance - with the palaces in front on the other direction; and, is said to be the ying-yang and lifelife for the country's power, safeguarding the emperors and rulers since ancient times.  There are some photo scenic spots but during our brief stay on nearby grounds, far too many tourists running through with their escort/guides waving banners hustling everyone to move along.  If time is short, skip this & head for the palaces in comfortable walking shoes instead."
