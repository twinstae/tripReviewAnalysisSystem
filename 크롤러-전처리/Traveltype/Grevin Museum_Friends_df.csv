I had fun with Einstein and Steve Jobs at the pop quiz room and I enjoyed making photos with other celebrities like Al Pacino, Brad Pitt, Messi and the Queen. The museum has a section with only k-drama stars and k-pop artist and overall it was a fun day."
1,4.0,Good place to spend an evening in Seoul. Some cool things to see and do here. Not a place to go multiple times
2,5.0,"Worthwhile visit. You can go through the process of making your sculpture, makeup, costume and finally, taking picture."
3,4.0,So you won‚Äôt find much mention of this place among the top attractions in Seoul. However I think it‚Äôs definitely worth the visit if you have time to spare. They have quite a few games/ interactions so it keeps you entertained rather than just walking around the wax figures.
4,5.0,"For me, it was the most interesting and funny museum which I have ever visited. Was confusing live people with their exhibits üòùüòùüòù"
5,4.0,"The tickets for this place was part of the Discover Seoul pass.I thought that this place was just a wax museum and was pleasantly surprised when it was a bit more than that. Keep your entrance ticket handy since that's what you use to play the mini games inside. Like other wax museums, you can pose with the actors for photo ops. Some of the displays or areas had games like roulette and landing (or in my case crashing) a plane. I thought that made it more interesting.Some of the wax statues were a bit hard to tell or unfamiliar but there were placards around so that you can figure out who you're looking at. Nice place to spend some time especially if you can recognise them all."
6,5.0,I booked the ticket through a travel app(Klook). I think I was charged less than lining up. It was a trip i need to fill in the gap between my departure time from incheon. I have about 7 hours before my flight and from the time I checked out. It was fun. The characters are interesting. Some familiar some not but still worth the trip.
7,4.0,"We came in late at this place, like just one hour they weill close so we had to do everything in a rush, but it was a nice tour! It was 4floors full of waxes, just something quite disappointing though was the Lee Min Ho wax, he didn't look like him or any close to him, but the rest were fine especially G-DRAGON! There is also a shop there for you to shop all those Lee Min Hoo, BIGBANG and JGS goodies!"
8,3.0,went to this place and tour starts at level 4. walked out from the elevator and shocked the atmosphere very quiet with deemed lights and you will see famous statue's. Some of the statue doesnt really look like to the celebrity. I was shocked that day where suddenly a staff was standing next to the statue suddenly moving. haha... i think they should say Welcome to Grevin
9,5.0,I visited with a friend. Will definitely come back again and recommend to friendsTaking ridiculous pictures and I enjoyed interactive games.It was a good time ;)I got a 10% discount on Mastercard!
10,5.0,"My friends wanted to take pictures with G-dragon and korean drama stars so we went there and it turned out to be really fun. Of course for foreign Hallyu fans the experience is mostly attractive because of the korean celebreties, but in reality world stars are just as interesting. The fact that you can become a part of everything is also a plus. So many games and activities, in my opinion a very nice way to spend time with friends and get hundreds of picures. Their gift shop has official goods of korean celebrities which is also quite handy for those who is interested in this kind of thing. I would definitely recommend."
11,5.0,"My visit at the Grevin museum was just as expected. Great wax figures and a lot of fun and pictures.As other Grevin's, you can ""meet"" with great people :)It's nearby City hall and other area of interest, so if you happen to be around, you should definitely stop by. I also received a link to download a snapshot of some of my visit.If you want to see Barack Obama or Leonardo DiCaprio or even Gandhi, this is the right place. Don't forget to say hi to the Pope :)"
12,4.0,"If you are already in the area of the stream, might as well pay a visit to this museum.  There is an entrance fee of 18000 won for adult.  The wax museum will start at the 4th floor down to the 1st floor.  If you are a fan of Korean stars, you can sit beside Lee Min Ho. You can also play the interactive games per area, I tried the simulation game of being a pilot and in order for you to lay the game, you have to scan your ticket code. At the end of the your you will be required to encode your email address so they can send all the pictures you had in the simulator, a wax figure of yourself and a lot more. They also have a 3D Gallery where you can take some pictures while holding the leaning tower, falling in a big hole and having a portrait in the plaza. You can allocate about 3 to 4 hours on this depending on how addicted you are on taking pictures. By the way you can have selfie with the stars and play casino with the ocean‚Äôs 11 cast."
13,5.0,"Frankly I've never been Myungdong before and had no idea where to go. However, I've been often told Grevin is one of the best wax museum out of Asia and was recommended by a good friend of mine who has already been there couple times. There were many figures of celerbrities and other public figures, such as Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. I loved how life-like those figures looked. It was so amazing I couldn't believe that some of them looked wayyy too real. It's worth the cost and fascinating to look at. I highly recommend this lovely wax museum to all of you!"

25,5.0,"I came here with a friend because we saw an advertisement on TV. We spend 2 hours in the museum and didn't even realize - the time went by so quick! Great sculptures, lovely arranged, many picture possibilities and games to play. I liked the wax figures here much more than at Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam! I'll definitely come back here! Best day of my holiday so far :-)"

35,5.0,I loved this museum was funny seeing a wax figure of the queen. This museum is cool and loved it especially getting to see wax figure of gdragon
36,4.0,"I went here with my school. This place is amazing to go to if you are in Seoul, I highly recommend it. The wax sculptures are freaky when you first see them, but they are great to use to lie to your friends about meeting celebrities! But seriously though, go here. You won't regret it."
37,4.0,"I enjoyed this museum particularly for a hallyu fan like me,  since there are lots of kdrama actors inside the museum. I was able to have my picture taken beside them.  Layout of the museum is good and there are interactive machines inside."
38,5.0,I am psyched to meet my favorite Korean stars in this Museum. They do have US president's statue and some international stars & celebrities. But they are commonly found in other wax museums. More additions to the K-Pop collections are recommended even though I am happiest to meet with Lee Min Ho & Park Shin Hye in this place...
39,5.0,"First time going to a wax museum. Entrance fee is 18,000 KRW. Lot famous people figures. Close to City Hall"
