It was fascinating history learning about this royal burial site which is one of many around Seoul. The walk has hills and I recommend walking shoes as itâ€™s gravel surface. Visit the History centre to see how the burial mound was formed and the coffin lowered into the ground and into a chamber. I would recommend this UNESCO World Heritage sure as a must see."
1,3.0,"Only 1000w to enter and it is a nice area to walk around but there is very little information in English about the tombs and the kings and queens that are buried here. There are toilets on site but not other facilities inside. Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and convenience stores right outside.Overall, a nice place to take a stroll, but shouldnt be a priority on a visit to Seoul."
2,4.0,"It was about 20-minute walk from Seolleung subway station in Gangnam area.  We reserved a walking tour from 'Visit Seoul.Net' website and the tour was free of charge.  The guide met us at the ticket booth of Seonjeongneung (meaning Seolleung and Jeongneung).After we bought our tickets, the guide toured us through the royal tombs of King Seongjong (the 9th king of the Joseon Dynasty), Queen Jeonghyeon (the second wife of King Seongjong) and King Jungjong (son of the two).  The tombs and surrounding statues were fenced off from visitors so we could not go near.  Seonjeongneung, together with burial grounds of other Joseon Kings and Queens have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  It was more like a quiet park in the busy Gangnam city and the tombs were of rather small-scale for kings and queen. Still it was worth visiting."
3,4.0,Several burial mounds of two kings and a queen of the Joseon era.Quite scenic and worth the walk. Located in Gangnam.
4,4.0,"We wanted to go already for some time, but the tombs are a bit far from our usual hangout places in Seoul. Despite that, the tombs are easily accessible either by subway (Seolleung station - both yellow and green lines) or bus.There's a KRW 1000 entrance fee, and the whole complex is secluded. It feels like an island of fresh and pure air in middle of the bustling city, and it is very well maintained.There are three tombs to see, an impressive forest (there's a 500 yo ginkgo tree) and plenty of small animals - birds, squirrels, woodpeckers, grouses.The whole complex is a UNESCO World Heritage."
