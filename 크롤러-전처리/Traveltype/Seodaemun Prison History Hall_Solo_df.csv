0,4.0,"Well thought out museum that gives an insight into Korea’s history and their relationship to Japan. As others have mentioned, if you are unfortunate enough to coincide your visit with a school tour then this really detracts from the experience. It is difficult to be affected by the torture cell displays when you are surrounded by screaming kids whose teachers do not control them. The museum staff also do not intervene. I also liberated a young man who had been locked in a cell by his ‘friends’."
1,5.0,"an easy subway stop spent 2 hours (go later in the morning after the school kids take their tours)download the app, wifi is free in the buildingswatch the touching videos of former prisoners.  there's enough in English about the Japanese occupation"
2,4.0,"I was very lucky to have a free tour guide for this. A very intelligent and well spoken kid ( he was only 14! ) was offering free guide for foreigners. Now everything became more meaningful as he went over the entire history of the prison and of Korea during those days. I do understand even better now why Japanese are not well-liked in Korea. Lots of kids with their teachers,  which is great. Respect for all the martyrs. Do yourself a favor and visit this place."
3,5.0,"It was on 5th May, which is Children Day in Korea, a beautiful day with blue sky, cool breeze and of course holiday break. I awarded myself a visit to Seodaemun prison to know more about Korean history and I was so curious to discover a different part of Seoul. This place seems like to be out of the beaten track for many tourists visiting Seoul, including myself. Before coming to Korea, I have not heard about Seodaemun prison. Seodaemun used to be a prison since 1910 by Japanese to torture and later execute Korean Independence Movement followers. The first thought pop into my mind was that this place would be scary, dark and horrible, and it was indeed horrible and terrifying once I entered the museum. I feel a bit guilty to say this but for someone having no idea about Seodaemun’s history; however, this place is a hidden gem of a hustle and bustle Seoul, stunning red-bricks halls, large playing ground with some green corners with a green grass field, trees and flowers… It was a bit crowded today, many school students and families visiting (probably because it was on Sunday and Children Day). I walked around the courtyard first, enjoying the nice weather and alive vibe at the courtyard.Walking around, I did not believe that these buildings used to be a horrific hell, where people were jailed, starved, tortured and killed. All the nicely elegant appearance outside of these red-brick wall buildings was completely deceitful. Inside the exhibition hall, there was a number of artefacts grouped into several displays, relating to the Independence Movement in Korea and the terrible mistreatment and torture of Japanese during their colony period. The basement under exhibition hall was not the place for the faint of a heart person, it was extremely unthinkable acting of violence. I have seen these terribly horribly unsympathetic torture methods for many times, but I still could not stand with it for any seconds. It was so dreadful that I just wanted to get out. I watched the video of an old man who was a Korean patriot. Seeing what he suffered after being ceiled here in Seodaemun, I just could not hold my tear and I do not think any of us can fully understand the hardship he and other people hold here suffered and their strong belief and determination to fight for the independence of their country and for freedom and happiness of their people. I still remember his saying “I am happy now because all Korean people are now happy”.  Seodaemun prison was now served as the special museum in remembrance of the dark history of Korean and Korean patriots. This place could be a bit of propaganda against the Japanese to someone. Just leaving the anti-Japanese attitudes I so often hear, however, this place, filled with its dark history, is a historic place to teach people, especially youths, about the sacrifice that made up Korea today, the value of independence and freedom and the horror of the war. Personally, this visit was an emotional experience, knowing more about the history of Korean people and discovering another part of Seoul. As Winston Churchill said, “Those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it”. So, I do hope that there will be no more wars around the world and there will be no such horrific mistreatment that happened here in Seodaemun will be repeated any other places.How to get there:[Subway] Dongnimmun Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 5. You can easily see the guidance to the entrance of prison right after leaving exit 5."
4,4.0,"Take the subway to the Dongnimmun station on the orange line. Leave through exit 5 and when you come to street level you can see the wall of the prison and easily follow signs to the entrance. The exhibits were interesting and moving. Most of the placards are in several languages, including English, so it's easy to follow along. I was disappointed that one of the prison halls with stories of individual prisoners only had information in Korean but there was plenty to see otherwise. If you're unfamiliar with the Japanese occupation of Korea I recommend doing a little reading about it before your visit. I had just finished reading ""The Living Reed"" by Pearl S. Buck and it made my visit there so much more meaningful. I also recommend following the route in the pamphlet they give you to completion. Some of the most interesting and moving exhibits were at the end.I had the same unfortunate experience with loud groups of school children (there were at least 3 large groups there) as another reviewer. Trying to experience a museum while large groups are moving through at the same time is not something I enjoy. However, I had started the museum around 1pm which is a common time for field trips to arrive. After the exhibits in the central building I took a break outside and sat in the shade for a bit. Walking around after 2pm was much easier. Some of the groups had left and the remaining ones had spread out. So if you find yourself bothered by large groups I suggest just waiting a bit."
5,5.0,"I can't believe how amazing this museum is, absolutely chilling and surreal. It's so important to intake in the history of the country you are visiting and I had an unforgettable experience. I also had a local with me as some parts are in Korean and he was able to read and explain it to me.  However be warned this can be a very emotional experience."
6,5.0,"A place which reminds South Koreans of the brutal colonial rule of Japan. A nice place to see what Koreans suffered before earning their independence. A place to show respect. People are free to take photos, but it is important to remember that people died of torture here."
7,4.0,I have been to a few prisons and this one was pretty interesting although I would have liked to see more displays about how the prisoners lived. More models and displays would be good although there were a few. Walking around the prison and imagining the painful history was interesting. There is also good hiking nearby and I would recommend going hiking early in the morning and then visiting the prison afterwards (especially in summer).
8,5.0,"You may need to toughtlen up a little bit when you come here, but overall, it's a very good experience when you want to learn about Korea. However, there are some texts without English :( Despite that, I still enjoyed my time here. There are only few tourists around. Most people who were there when I came were students and those who are in their mandatory military training. So if you want to stay off the touristy track, do come to this place. Admission is only 3,000₩. :)"
9,3.0,"Prison was overall interesting and I could feel the solemn atmosphere of the different spots. However, they are not as inclusive in the sense that a lot of the signages are still untranslated and it makes me feel that I am missing out a little on the small details."
10,4.0,"This should be a top attraction in Korea. The prison is actually a museum, that depicts not only the facilities of the prison and the atrocities perpetrated in it, with graphic pictures and, mostly, reconstruction of tortures with dummies, but also tells us the history of Korea's occupation by Japan (1910-1945). It is well organized and therefore easy to follow. Not everything is also in English but most of it is. The caveat is that I found it a little biased. It focuses strongly on the Japanese era and clearly is a strong criticism to that, which is OK. However, there is nothing about the period 1945-1987, during which the prison was run by Korea, after their freedom from Japanese occupation."
11,4.0,"The exhibits are well presented and many have English descriptions. Also, the route is well marked, so it is easy to follow. Visited during a school vacation, so there were groups of children visiting. They were quite noisy despite many signs with 'be quiet' (in English and Korean), but the museum workers did not seem to care. Seemed a bit inappropriate in a place like this. To be fair, this becomes less of a problem once you get out of the main exhibit building.Also, the presentation seems a bit one-sided, as it focuses strongly on the Japanese occupation and the crimes committed during this period. For example, some (more 'neutral') exhibits have only Korean descriptions, but most about particularly bad torture or mistreatment of inmates also have descriptions in English, Chinese and (of course) Japanese. No-one can deny that the occupation was terrible, but the facility was also used as a prison by Korean governments until 1987. Little information is given about the 40+ years after WW2. Still, very educational and well worth a visit."
12,4.0,"Firstly make sure you don't come on a Monday like I did as I found it closed (I should had known to check) I did return the following day thou, well presented and once again minimal cost to the attraction gives a good overview of how the prison adapted to the required changes over time with Japan's occupation.  If you are interested in these sort of attractions certainly worth a couple of hours spent here."
13,5.0,Really enjoyed the enjoyed the gardens which this building is situated. Some excellent picture taking. The emotional story is well described too.
14,4.0,"Lively educational facility that demonstrates and memorialize the efforts paid by the people who struggled for independence.  The prison was designed by the Japanese.   It showed the prison lives and the brutality of the Japanese.   Detail descriptions in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese."
15,4.0,"A very enjoyable experience that has both hangul and english lettering as tour the facilities. When I went there was no guided tour, but it was easy to find your way around in the intended path as a result of arrows/signage. Incredibly cheap when I went, only 3,000 KRW and right off the subway line! Great for an afternoon visit."
16,4.0,"dont expect lots of artefact, this prison is  standing to remind every Koreans that not so long ago Japanese came and tried to exterminate their freedom. If you are not Japanese, you should go and pay respect. visit the adjacent building where people were put to death (hanging) and realize how much different Korea has become today."
17,4.0,"I found this a very educational visit as I knew little of the Japanese rule over Korea. Most of the information was in English - not everything, but definitely enough to make this place a worthwhile place to visit. The park next door is a nice place to wander through too."
18,4.0,"Came here upon recommendation by a friend, and it didn't disappoint. It was a wonderful learning visit, but a little heart wrenching at some point. Definitely a place for history lovers. Spent about 2hours here, after reading all the English descriptions that was available; some exhibits didn't. The site was easy to find from Dongnimmun station. After paying 3000won for the entry, I was free to explore the grounds. The first block was a kind of a introductory exhibit where the history of the prison was introduced. There were many blocks on the ground. However, there was a certain flow indicated to tell you which block to go to next everytime you exited one. It felt like I was moving through a story, and it helped me to not miss out any exhibits.I happened to visit on the day when many schools trips were taking place. Groups and groups of students were all over. It got a tad annoying because they were noisy (didn't help when I was trying to have a moment of silence). But, their noise and chattering was appreciated I was walking through the eerie torture chamber and execution house. Those places sent chills down my spine, and good thing there was laughter around to lighten the mood a little."
19,5.0,This is a museum of Korean life under Japanese occupation. There are lots to see and well worth a visit. Use line 3 and short walk from the station.
20,3.0,First reaction better than last. I wouldn't do this over other attractions. It's light on English details and very recreated v authentic. Good quick history lesson.
21,3.0,"The prison and grounds are kept in good condition. The red brick buildings are somewhat unique here in Korea, so I enjoyed looking around them. The prison has been restored to the point that it's almost hard to imagine it as a place of torture and despair. They have recreations of various torture methods used. You can see the exercise grounds where prisoners were separated by walls while exercising, the execution room, and the secret tunnel used to carry bodies out. I am not giving this a better review for two reasons: while many signs were in English and in Korean, there were enough signs that were only in Korean that I felt like I was missing out on some really interesting stories. The other, and more important reason, is that it is so one-sided that it feels like a nostalgic, naive look back on Korean patriots rather than an objective history museum. While that nostalgia doesn't need to be completely eliminated, it should have been much more balanced. I would have liked to have heard about the Japanese guards and their lives, during and after. I really think they should have talked more about the prison after the Japanese occupation more. Who were the prisoners under the newly formed Korean government and how were they treated then? Was it similar to how the Japanese treated prisoners? I know the new Korean government had a massive crackdown on dissidents, but they are barely mentioned. If you are interested in prisons or the Japanese occupation, I would still recommend this because it is a unique look into an important part of Korean history."
22,5.0,"Trying to fill my time I came across this location in my guide book and it was worth the visit. For 3,000 won you get to walk around this huge prison museum and see the suffering Koreans endured during Japanese occupation. You may need 1.5 hours to tour this huge place. Great visuals with pictures and recreations of torturous methods used on prisoners."
23,5.0,"The halls, the cells, the buildings, the stories and the displays will open your eyes to a dark period of Korean history but rather than focusing on the gruesomeness of the events that took place here, take a moment to reflect and understand the struggle for Korean Independence, the pride Koreans have for their country. It's a solemn place so place be respectful. keep quiet and use this visit to learn more and understand Korea better."
24,4.0,I wandered to the prison one day when I had a few hours to spare. It was a hard to face reality of the Japanese occupation. But it is part of the history and I did see many young families there. There were wax figures in the torture section that may be scary to young children. (It can be bypassed since the walk is self guided). There is a replica of the prison exercise yard and several of the cell blocks. Not much in English - but really not needed.
25,5.0,Sobering reminder of the struggle that this county endured for its independence.  Amazing juxtaposition in looking at the grounds of the prison yard with the skyscrapers and apartment complexes nearby.
26,3.0,"Seodaemun Prison is a unique attraction amongst all the towers, temples, museums or palaces you might have the opportunity to visit in Korea. It's definitely worth visiting. The surrounding Seodeamun Independence Park (with its statues, grass paths, pools) is also nice and the prison sits it very nicely. The prison is a great yet troubling and horrifying way to learn about Korea's complex history. However, keep in mind that visiting the prison doesn't take more than an hour. And while many museums in Korea are foreigner-friendly, with a lot of explanations in English, the prison overall lacks context. This is especially regrettable because for people who might not be well familiar with the Japanese occupation of Korea, they might miss on what this museum trully means and represents. Finally, while most major museums in Korea are free, the prison, while also public, costs 3000 KRW to visit. Not expensive, but still surprising that you have to pay more to visit this than the National Museum of Korea for example..."
27,4.0,"The Seodaemun Prison History Hall is an epic monument that clearly shows the evil nature of the Japanese captors because there are dozens of torture chambers and methods that were used against Koreans. Yes, the Japanese did much worse when they burned down Royal Palaces and tried to erase Korean History, but nothing remains from those atrocities. Here, for example, you can see or actually step into these horrific caskets used for psychological torture. There are many other examples of how Koreans were enslaved in this museum. It's so real, you'll feel it. One of the better remnants that tells the truth of history through meticulous preservation. Plz go if you have the time..."
28,3.0,"I am glad that I took the time to visit this spot. It's not on my top 10 list of things to see in Seoul, but it did help me to gain some insight into the animosity between South Korea and Japan."
29,4.0,This place was used to be a prison when Korea was under the Japanese administration. It shows cruelty of Japanese and you can feel the spirit of the old Korean people who worked for the independence.
30,5.0,"This attraction is a must-do for anyone interested in history. There is not a lot of information provided in English in the museum, but the story of the torture and imprisonment which took place here is made clear. The basement of the museum building is where the actual torture took place - seeing the life-sized figures in the cells and hearing the soundtrack of someone screaming gave me goosebumps! The little hut where those found guilty were executed is also very poignant. The cell block and exercise yards are the other points of interest. The prison is a bit out of the way, but a really interesting and moving place to visit if you get a chance."
31,5.0,"A great museum, and a good lesson in the history between Japan and South Korea. It really touches your heart, and you can feel the despair in the walls."
32,5.0,This place was one of the last places I visited on my trip to Korea and it was by far one of the best sites to see only costing 3 wons (3 dollars). I arrived early so not too many people were there and it made it so much more interesting to feel the emptyness of those cell blocks. All the exhibits were translated to english so it was informative as well as educational.
33,4.0,This prison museum provides a well rounded view of Korean cultural and political changes over the last 100 years or so.  Well organized and mostly English speaker friendly.  Right next to a subway stop.
34,4.0,"The second prison museum I've visited (the first being Alcatraz in San Francisco), one thing is the same - the gloomy and depressing feeling as I walked through the halls. The rainy weather probably made it even lonelier. The museum is well-preserved, and not that crowded on a weekday. You can slowly enjoy reading all the exhibits without anyone disturbing.All in all, I'll recommend this museum if you want to find out more about the history of the Independence Movement. It's a quiet place to do some self-reflection and thinking. For more photos, http://travellerelf.blogspot.sg/2014/03/korean-culture-history-seodaemun-prison.html"
