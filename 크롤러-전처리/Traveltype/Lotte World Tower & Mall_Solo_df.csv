0,5.0,Lotte Tower provides a great view of the city. The flashing lights all around the city and bridge makes it a must see at night!
1,5.0,"You will see amazing views from the tower, the elevator is very quick and theirs a museum that you can walk around before you head up to the top. Wow is all I can say"
2,5.0,The mall was really large and they offered things in a good price. The tower had a great view and I personally think it was better than the Petronas or Taipei.
3,3.0,"It's a luxury mall. Not the best mall. Personally, Singapore has better malls. It's just super hyped. You can skip it if you are a budget traveler"
4,4.0,I intended to visit just the tower but there was so much to do I came back for a second day.The Tower has great views and you can eat on one of the levels as well. Just don’t skip anything on a level as I couldn’t figure out how to go back down just a level only all the way down to the 1st floor Little world amusement park was wonderful had the best roller coasters on the outside and plenty of smaller rides all around The Lotte Museum was great too spent half a day inside there and they let you take pictures and have other interactive itemsThey have a KPOP experience as well it was nice just not to big they could make that much better Then the mall has tons of high end brands to everyday itemsYou can easily spend 2 whole days here to see everything
5,5.0,Great shopping mall overall! Lotte is one of the hallmark shopping malls/supermarkets in Korea. They have some of the most interesting shops and supermarkets there! I liked the video game shop a lot. But they don't have all those video games that you might think in North America. But the world tower is beautiful and bright! Will return there one day. It's pretty close to the Seoul Railway Station in which you will meet beggars around the underground.
6,5.0,"Lotte World mall has an awesome creative design, how i wonder is the design per zone ...beautiful...elegant ...perfect! The upper class product is available here  such as hermes, burberry, etc."
7,5.0,"At $27 per person it was a pretty costly trip atop the world's 5th tallest structure but worth it for the night view. Went up just before it turned dark so got a view of the city in the daylight but it's the night time when the city really shines. Photos are  tricky during the day because the external water stains are awful and at night there's the light reflecting off the glass in some places but with 360 viewing you're bound to capture a few great shots. Note there is an airport type security check before heading into the elevators. I didn't have anything of note but not sure what you'd do if you have something not allowed up. Inside the elevator the ceiling and walls light up with an amazing show as if you're flying into space. On the ride down there is a fireworks show on the ceiling and walls. Unbelievably fast ride considering the trip up 120+ floors. Don t go if you're claustrophobic,  people are crammed in, but very short trip - felt like 30 seconds - so not too bad."
8,5.0,try to enter lotte world tower and go up to 117th floor and up to 121st floorgreat amazing views all around seoulcan see gangman area and olympic park from here
9,4.0,"I had fun here with my friends. We went to most of the rides, and saw the famous Merry-Go-Round that was filmed in the drama, Stairway to Heaven kdrama. It is a nice place to come and have fun with your family and friends for sure!"
10,5.0,"You can spend hours here, there are tourist attractions, restaurants, supermarkets, mall stores, underground shopping and dining, an adventure park, tall sightseeing tower, and connections to two major subway lines and scores of bus lines.  Just go here!"
11,5.0,"Very impressive skyscraper, which is among the tallest in the world. Beautiful surroundings, and attached is a very nice shopping mall. Everything is very clean and well organized."
12,5.0,"The Lotte World Tower and Mall is a must when in Seoul. The Lotte World Tower is one of the tallest building in the world and offers a day and night breathtaking view with several floors open to the public to visit from the 117th to the 121st floor. Also, you can enjoy and relax by having a dessert and a coffee while you enjoy the view or seat and get an artist to draw you a caricature plus an area to buy some nice souvenirs. You can take pictures to the inside and the outside and wait to see the beautiful sunset in one of the best cities in the world Seoul ! Finally, you can take a walk on the Mall and make sure to go outside and take walk in the park around the lake."
13,5.0,This mall is like 7 + floors. It's a shopper's dream. I stayed at the Signeil so I just took the elevator down to the mall to shop and eat every day! It's also connected to other duty free malls as well as the subway is conveniently located.
14,4.0,I found myself inadvertently exploring this huge mall as I tried to find the cinema complex which was on various floors in the main building of the mall. I was under a bit of time pressure so I didn't fully explore the full extent of the shops in the mall. But there certainly seemed to be a plethora of high end branded shops and stores as well as more than enough places to eat and drink. No doubt a compulsive shopper would have a field day here. There was even a duty free shop but I didn't go in this time.
15,5.0,I went up hot the 120th floor of the lotte world tower and is was amazing. The view from the top was amazing. You had a 360 degree view of the city. Well worth the visit.
16,5.0,"It's pretty cool being up the Lotte World Tower! I believe I spent 27,000Won and I caught the last trip up around 8pm (they close around 10pm I believe). The elevator going up/down has some really cool videos of the Tower. Very entertaining! It also shows you what floor you're in and how many meters you're up above the ground!! OMG! I love the views, the gift shops, and the restaurants up the Tower.  The restaurants are a little pricey though lol! Go during the day or night, you will definitely have plenty of picturesque view of the city underneath you! There's also a place where you can go outside and experience a nice breeze! It was really nice! Go and check it out for yourself! Also, parking is plenty around the Mall and the surrounding area if you are driving to get there."
17,5.0,"On my last evening in Seoul , I saw this amazing building from my hotel room ! Nobody had told me about it , so I arranged to go by taxi and was invited by a Korean friend to visit The Signiel hotel . This building is stunning . I was staggered by the scale of it and from a distance it has a kind of timeless futurist design . As we approached it by taxi , it was dusk and the dynamic lighting of the complex at the foot of this mountain of a building was very state of the art ... we went up to the top floors of the viewing tower . And the video installations in the corridors were breathtaking . The elevator has 360 video art which distracts from the fact that we rise 101 floors in 60 seconds .. the views from the top at night are the pride of modern South Korean life !! Seoul looks like a perfect Eutopia from this viewpoint . The Signiel Hotel is also like stepping into a SF movie .. mega expensive, but worth it !!"
18,5.0,As a Lotte Hotel Guest I got a discount and quickly ascended to the top.The Tower opened April 2017 and is very impressive.
19,5.0,"Comparing to other towers, the full experience is incredible! Since you start walking thru the elevator, you will be able to admire how the building was made and a comparison between old and new Seoul.Eventouhth  its expensive, you must visit it!"
20,5.0,"I went to lotte tower whilst visiting korea during the olympics an the view from the top is amazeing. It was was a vit overcast when i went but on a clear day i can imagine it to be brilliant.Theres plenty to do here aswell, shopping, eating food an theres even an aqaurium in there.Defo worth a visit if your in Seoul."
21,4.0,"I have visited the place a few times and this time the tower is fully completed and in business. It is a majestic landmark. Seokchon Lake in front of it is very beautiful in early April, with flourishing cherry blossoms. The lake is romantic at night with lakeside lights. The lake is sort of divided into two sections, separated by a bridge, but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway. It is somewhat confusion trying to get to the lake, but I usually choose to either get out from Exit 2 of Jamsil metro station or from Exit 14 of Lotte World Tower."
22,5.0,"Go there. This is the best Mall ever. I do not think we have one as nice in the United States. There is food, Designer Shops, Shoes, everything a person would want in the mall. There is an Aquarium and an Art Museum. I enjoyed it so much I went back a second time. The train station has underground shopping also and you can access the mall from the train station."
23,5.0,"I went on a Monday so it wasn’t that busy. I paid the standard price (no fast pass needed when I went). You go through security screening. The employees are very efficient and nice in directing you where to go. The views are breathtaking and peaceful. There is a small outside deck on the floor where you exit, very cool experience. I can’t say enough."
24,5.0,"As one of the tallest buildings in the world, this was a must-see for me being a real estate enthusiast. The views and experience are worth it. Nice shopping, dining, and sightseeing experience all around. Try visiting just before sunset so you can get both daylight and nighttime photos. Once you ride the elevator up, you can spend as long as you want on the top floors so you can relax, take photos, and just soak it all in."
25,4.0,"This place is huge, it includes shops, the tower and an indoor theme park. It was perfect for us on a rainy day."
26,5.0,Pricey but is gret to go once to see the  skyline and to step on the clear glass and look down. The mall has a good variety too. If you have a mastercard you get a discount 10% At night is best because there is no wait
27,5.0,Seoul Sky is located on the 117th ~ 123rd floors of Lotte World Tower - Sky Terrace - and is the 5th tallest building in the world. Great
28,5.0,"I originally came to this to photograph the building but soon was taken in by the department store, then the mall, the the amusement park...and more.  I managed to find a wonderful group of locks on a fence to proclaim their love in the park next too the building."
29,5.0,This is a really tall tower that you can see in a clear day from Yeoido. Have areally incredibl view of the city i will say the best view of the city. If you go to Seoul this is a must go tower and mall. Lotte did and incredible job with this tower at night have beutiful lights.
30,4.0,Great selection of high end brands. Chanel and Van Cleef sales staff were wonderful.  Hermes not so much.  Maybe they couldn't speak English. just stood there and stared at you hahaha..so strange.
31,4.0,"It is complex malls. Amusement park, indoors and outdoors. Department store, observatory, duty free shop, cinema, book store, lots of restaurants, etc. If you stay nearby, it is a must to visit"
32,4.0,Quite expensive but up 500m you have like six different floors to explore. You will have your view over Seoul from its best view. Make sure it’s a clear day or night.
33,3.0,"Korea's tallest building had multiple safety issues before construction was completed including cracks in the floor of the movie theater and in the glass of tanks in the aquarium. They took care of these issues and reopened these areas. That being said, there's nothing really special here. It's a shopping mall with a movie theater and aquarium at the base of a tall building. Don't drive here, parking in the underground garage is outrageous."
34,5.0,"The Lotte World Tower and the adjacent Mall are the latest touristic highlights of Seoul. During my last visit I missed coming out here, but this time I went there 3 times to see kit 'all'. You can take the Metro Lines 2 & 8 to get there."
35,4.0,"Lotte world tower and mall is a huge mall.Conveniently located at Jamsil station (line 2 and 8) - exit 1/2.Main attraction is Seoul sky which is a must visit place - though a bit expensive. I have written a separate review for the same.This mall is no different from Other high end malls of the city. Multiple shops to buy from, many of them offer instant tax refund on shopping above 30000 won. Many places to eat as well."
36,4.0,"If you've been to Dubai, it will somewhat remind you of Dubai Mall.I don't think it's as big but the feel of the mall is huge & fancy, also connected to a metro stop as well as there's an aquarium!"
37,5.0,This is the 5th in the world and 4th in Asia. I've seen the others and this compares favourably.  The architecture us classical yet beautiful.  Connected to an amazing huge futuristic mall.Located at Jamsil area. The observation deck from floors 117 upward costs about $50 but the queue is extreme. Plenty of food choices in the mall. But be prepared to wait
38,4.0,I visited the Lotte Tower in early September and had a great view of the city on a beautifully clear day. The multiple observation decks and glass floors in certain areas make for an unforgettable experience. I got there shortly after the tower opened for the morning (10:00 AM) on a weekday and was able to purchase my tickets and go right up to the observation deck without any waiting.
39,4.0,"I went to the top in the beginning of the evening. The view was clear and the city looks very impressive. Also stood on the glass plate at the 123st floor. There is also a sky lounge/restaurant where you can enjoy the view with a drink or diner. Romantic if you are with your partner, but not alone..."
40,4.0,"I took the Sky Shuttle to the top of the tower. It was not a very busy day for it, but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines. It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator. You literally have people pressing up against you on every side. Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds, you couldn't see anything. It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldn't be able to see much. There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground, but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible. When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down, there seemed to be no order to the line, people were cutting the line, pushing & shoving. It would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd."
41,5.0,Came here (to Big Guy's Lobster) on Monday and had the grilled lobster and I have to say that it is easily some of the best lobster I've ever had; it's so good that it's comparable to high-end East coast Canadian lobster. I was greeted by Mike the manager and had a great conversation with him. He is fluent in both Korean and English so locals & international travelers wont have any trouble communicating with him if they have any modifications they wish to make or concerns about allergies and such. Lobsters are live and cooked in front of you. This is a must try if you're in Seoul & a seafood lover like myself. Don't miss this gem in the Lotte World Mall!PS. Rest of the mall is also really great and is with checking out. There's something for everyone here.
42,5.0,"4 floors 360 degrees of viewing space, cafe on 2 levels, 1 floor has 2 sections with glass floors, the floor above that you can go out side but the windows on the outside of the building are dirty but you still get a good views"
43,5.0,"Just visited it 2017-04-08. I am usually not info writing any kind of reviews, but this time I had to. The place iš MUST visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul.  The view, staff, everything is just perfect. Trip to observation deck cost ~25$ and if you are not sure if its worth it, or you are just poor student, skip your dinner but visit this place!!  :-) Thank you Lotte for this experiance,  this was amazing,  good job :-)"
44,5.0,"I saw this building under Construction last Januaru 2015. And its finally finished. The Lotte World Tower is a 123-floor, 554.5-metre (1,819 ft) supertall skyscraper that finished external construction on March 17, 2016. The building's final 123rd floor was topped out on December 22, 2015.  It is currently the tallest building in the OECD, and is the 5th tallest building in the world. A must visit when your in Korea"
