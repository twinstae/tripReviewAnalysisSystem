0,5.0,They are so many unique fishes and entertaining shows. You can buy cute soft toys as a souvenir when you leave the place
1,3.0,I’ve been to many aquariums and thought this one was just okay. There were many families with small children and they were having a great time. There’s a lot of activities for kids . Interactive stations were cool. I went with my grown son and he didn’t enjoy it much. Definitely visit if you have small children. There’s a good variety of marine life. The layout of the place was great.
2,5.0,"Bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via Klook and it cost us approx SGD$25 per pax...with the experience! Many interesting sea creatures (penguins, sharks, walruses etc). especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures (eg starfish, clams, fishes). They even have a fish spa area! Very suitable for families with children:) My elderly parents loved it too! Totally worth the trip ❤️ the layout of the whole area is v well thought out. Foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience:)"
3,4.0,"First time to see piranha.Had an awesome time in COEX. The aquarium is just beautiful and highly recommended if you coming with your kids. Educational yet fun. The only feedback from me, all the show were in Korean language which for a foreigner like us could not understand. Other than that everything was good. Another spot to visit if you’re coming to Korea."
4,2.0,"After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, we were quite excited to go here. However, it just felt over priced.The whole theme is Octonauts, a kids tv show, so clearly it was aimed towards really young children. The fish habitats include the octonauts toys.Having been to many aquariums, the fish here just look quite miserable. Many of them felt lifeless and it's unclear if it's due to their environment being intruded by the colourful toys. The manatee aquarium especially looked too small for the beautiful creatures, who were staying at the bottom and could barely float vertically without having to bend. Too many tanks that were just too small.The place seemed to be centered around what kids want. It's bright and colourful. The baby shark song was playing throughout and almost drove me insane.The area for Doctor Fish to bite at your skin is not monitored. A kid put her whole hand in and started swishing the water violently. The touch pool was also not monitored. Kids could just lift up and throw the creatures without any care for the guidelines stated. More thought should be put into this.Feeding sessions are turned into ways to educate kids about the wildlife, which i thought was done very well. The amazonian wildlife area was also well constructed that i was amazed. Many of the fish were bigger than the ones i have seen in other places, which is also good. My favourite parts were the pairie dog enclosure, which is ironic since it is not a sea creature. The stamp collecting thing they have is pretty cool too, since i am a teenager and still willing to run around collecting them.Overall, the priority here seems to be the kids. However, the welfare of the animals should not be compromised in trying to do so. It felt a little sad to look at some of them. Aesthetic should always take a backseat when animals are involved."
5,3.0,"Just like other reviews here, the reason why we went to this aquarium is to fill out the use of our Discover Seoul Pass.  The entrance fee to Coex is on the high side and will easily justify the cost of the Discover Pass.  This is one of two aquariums that is available for entry by the Discover Pass, and this is one is much better, as the other one felt more like an oversized aqua pet shop.Some displays are in ponds, some are in big tanks, but a lot are in aquarium tanks sizes.  However, the aquarium tanks are big for a lot of the fishes, so these provide great viewing opportunities.  The fish spa experience allows one to feel the doctor fish nibble on your hand.The coex mall has also been upgraded, as compared to the last time I went here a long time ago,"
6,4.0,"We went to Coex aquarium because it is part of the Discover Seoul Pass and we can enter for free if we bought the pass.  We were really not interested in going to the aquarium at first as we have been to a lot of big aquariums, so we were not expecting something great from an aquarium in a mall.  Please note that I am an avid Aquarist and I love to visit public aquariums, my kids also love them as well.When we got there though we were happily surprised, the aquarium was well presented, the layout was nice and the exhibits were well kept.  I think there was some confusion about the two types of Arawanas though, as they bunched both the asian ones and the amazon ones in the same area.  They also had a few Mammals on exhibit, the Prairie dogs and the African Manatees were really cute, and we were lucky that we were there during feeding time. Penguins were also nice as well.The kids loved the experience of the Garra Rufa or Fish spa fish, after they were asked to wash their hands and then put them in the tank with the fish, the kids stayed there for maybe 10minutes.If I were to give improvement suggestions to the aquarium, I would say, put more explanation on all the exhibits, environment, diet, conservation status, etc.  and also make sure english translation is accurate.  I can say that the exhibits is comparable to the Ocean Park aquarium in Manila, except that they do not have the outdoor shows, which is fine by me.  One new thing that the kids learned at the aquarium is how to determine if a shark is male or female!I would say that we all loved the ""Nursery"" where we saw baby seahorses and pregnant male seahorses, the Axolotl is also a favorite of my kids. I would highly recommend going to this Aquarium if you love fishes."
7,5.0,"A really fun and visually impressive aquarium. The layout and design of each area is well thought out. Multiple observation rooms give great opportunities to see a large number of unique, beautiful fishies and other animals! Add this place to your ""must see"" list if you are in the area."
8,4.0,Good Aquarium in the COEX shopping mall如果可以多點介紹部份或互動部份更好。例如短片介紹或iPad 遊戲等。 希望下次可以見到鯊魚位置表演 或其他關於魚類嘅介紹節目。
9,3.0,"They have quite a few interesting exhibits that I have not seen in other aquariums but overall, the place is built for kids and the adults might find it boring if they've been to other aquariums."
10,5.0,Lots of things to see. Nicely decorated. Big and spacious.  My kids (8 and 2 years old) enjoyed a lot. There are also some interactive exhibits that you can touch the sea creatures.
11,5.0,Our son loved the aquarium. If you need to spend a day inside this is a great place to do it. There are a ton of people there however so go early.
12,4.0,"This is a fun aquarium for young kids. In contrast to the educational scientific approach, this aquarium focuses on being fun and lively. First part of aquarium had ovtonauts related displays, then there is a place where you can touch “doctor fish” and star fish. There is also a shark area and some penguins. It’s a nice place to spend about 90 mins with kids under seven, but not much larger than that."
13,4.0,"Went there at 12pm with a group of young kids over the summer. Just in time to catch the sea animals feeding schedule. There was a small touch pool and also a hand spa from doctor fish. What an experience for the kids! It took us about 3 hours to finish the whole thing as we also took quick snack break. There is a snack café which sells hot dog, sausage, ice cream and drinks. There are many drinks vending machine in the aquarium too. If you simply want to see some sea marine, the tour usually takes 1-1.5 hours."
14,5.0,Amazing variety of sea life displayed in most imaginative surroundings like kitchen sinks and fire extinguishers. And why not!! Impressive larger animals like rays were fascinating. This place is more than its location under a super mall promises. The only negative was missing supervision as children were touching some petting animals much more than recommended - parental guidance is obviously not enough...
15,2.0,"Was supposed to be a highlight of our trip to Seoul.While the whole attraction, as a whole, was really good, the touch pool was appalling. I am all for aquariums allowing their guests to touch the different kinds of sea creatures on display for education but i strongly feel that these interactions must be closely, and strictly, monitored by staff. This was absent at COEX. Kids (I don't blame them, I blame their parents / adult guardians) were squeezing these poor creatures. I am very sure that these creatures were feeling tortured. If there's no staff to supervise, don't open the touching pool.To further my disappointment, there was a sign saying that feeding for the pirahnas was starting at a certain time but it never happened.In all honesty, the only positive I took from the visit was that I got to see turtles and a cowfish.Unless COEX improves their standards, I will never visit the aquarium again."
16,5.0,"This was one of the better aquariums we have seen and the exhibits were set up in way which was interesting and fun for young children. We finished the walk through the exhibits within two hours, but missed the shows which tend to be in the afternoon, particularly over the weekend - there are less shows on weekdays."
17,4.0,"This aquarium is Octonaut-themed, and my boy loves it! There are many different areas, classified based on geographical zones, with petting area to interact with the marine creatures. This place is highly recommended for families with kids."
18,4.0,We didn’t expect much as it was a last minute decision to visit.It was a weekday so the crowd was few and far in between.The variety of animal was a surprise. Although it was meant to be an aquarium but we also got to see prairie dogs and beavers.The sardine show was good and entertaining. Would recommend if you have a few hours to spare.
19,5.0,"My husband and I took our 6 month old baby to the aquarium on a rainy day and had a wonderful time! We were amazed at how beautifully maintained and clean all the tanks in the aquarium are. The animals seem very well taken care of. We especially enjoyed the quirky section of the aquarium where fish are living in all sorts of funny places - a telephone booth, glass lanterns, tupperware inside a refrigerator, etc. It was entertaining for our baby as well as us adults. I would definitely go back!"
20,5.0,"This aquarium has the greatest variety of fish I´ve ever seen! It even has penguins! I really liked the theme each room had and you can even touch some of the creatures there, like the starfish. Great for family trips!"
21,4.0,Our family of five had a wonderful time in the Coex Aquarium! Many different areas to explore and Santa was diving with the fish! There were lots of kids and families but never felt too crowded. Lots to see and fun exhibits! There was a food festival on the front of the Coex on this particular year day and we had a great lunch! The Aquarium was the perfect place to get out of the cold!
22,5.0,"Was a great day out with the kids, as shopping mall next door. We spent about 2 hrs there, very easy to get to. Great indoor activity if weather is bad."
23,4.0,"Mixed feelings about aquaria. first of all not all sea creatures are truly beautiful to look at... secondly, similar to zoos it can be somewhat sad to see these animals in small tanks....That being said, the children loved this aquarium. it builds up well. the start is quite modest and includes some rather weird settings as well as animals (bunnies, ferrets, hamsters/chipmunks). But at any rate they have a full selection ranging from sweet water river fish that are probably more culturally relevant to Koreans all the way to jelly fish, turtles, sharks, eels, moray, sting ray etc.The beginning of the tour seems to cater to small children with an octonaut theme. Towards the end you're able to see 6+ feet shark, stingray that look like mini-flying-carpets the size of a coffee table..."
24,5.0,"This is the best aquarium I have been so far. The environment is really good, kids have opportunity to touch in some kind of attractions alive, the glasses surrounding the aisle give us an impressive sensation and kids are surprised all the time."
25,4.0,"Been to Seoul a couple of times and this is our first visit to the aquarium.  The aquarium is located in coex mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants. The aquarium itself wasn’t big, you can basically cover the whole place in a hour or so. There are some very innovative display of the fishes in this place, eg a water dispenser filled with fishes, a fire extinguisher acts as a fish tank etc. Pretty interesting! The rest are pretty much your usual aquarium stuffs. Go if you are traveling with young kids, they will love the place."
26,1.0,"This Aquarium it's nothing special! It depends a lot on what have you saw before. So, if you have been before in great aquariums forget about this one, it's small and has nothing special to see and it seams that they don't take very well care about the animals there. But if you are with little kids and don't know what to do i thing you can go there and enjoy."
27,5.0,"We visited as part of an organised tour, this is a good little aquarium with fish in a variety of quirky settings. Its well worth a visit and not too expensive."
28,3.0,"The aquarium is located within Coex mall and is designed to be kids friendly. It was interest to see innovative way of displaying the fishes in the aquarium, like retrofitting an old telephone broth into a fish tank."
29,5.0,"Spent 2,5 amazing hours with 4 children aged 2 to 9 in this aquarium!  Highly recommend to anyone with and without children"
30,4.0,"This place is much better than the one at the Coex Centre in Seoul. My 7-year-old had a great time there, especially feeding the fish. Really liked the variety of fish and animals. You can buy discounted tickets through Gmarket. You can do the aquarium in the morning and Kidsania in the afternoon if you have enough energy. Kids will have a perfect day."
31,5.0,"Arrived at coex mall for some shopping and decided to hit the Aquarium first with our 4 year old; she loves sea creatures!We've been to a fair few aquariums around the world and this one has a really cute and quirky display. We really enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and so did our daughter. The doctor fish part was probably our favourite. Lots of fresh water sea life from all part of Asia, really interesting to see. Would definitely visit again"
32,4.0,"The best thing about this aquarium is that it's not very big, which is ideal for a little toddler - it's just nice for him and and spent a few hours here. Don't expect to see aquariums like seaworld etc and you'll enjoy it"
33,4.0,"We were shopped out since we were staying in Myeongdong and the idea of going to a pricey mall wasn't appealing, but I figured at the very least we should check out the Gangnam neighborhood made famous by the singer Psy and if we got bored we could go to the aquarium.Firstly, the mall is pretty awesome looking. We didn't see anything extraordinary at the shops but loved the library in the wide open middle space. It was a trek to find the aquarium but we did and passed a sign offering foreign visitors a 10 percent discount if you took a picture of the sign, so we were able to snag a discount to boot. We didn't have the highest of expectations and were pleasantly surprised. We love aquariums and have been to various ones in the US, Sydney, Vancouver, Singapore etc. I wouldn't say this collection was unusual but it was nicely presented including my favorite of a phone booth filled with small fish. They also had transformed other ordinary objects into tiny aquariums. When we arrived we raced to an otter feeding but it was in Korean with no translation so we left after a bit to enjoy wandering around. The aquarium was much larger than we expected and we spent more than an hour there. I also enjoyed the large shark and stingray tank, again not unusual but still cool to see."
34,5.0,We went here July 2016 with our daughter. We love coex and it was beautiful but we do not manage to see the live show.
35,2.0,"My son was utterly disappointed after reaching the site, it's rather small. And compared to other Aquariums in Hong kong, singapore and Thailand it's nothing."
36,5.0,"An educational experience and fun for all ages, well organised and friendly staff, sardine love show is so enchanting."
37,5.0,There were species we had never seen before and some which we did not expect to see in an Aquarium --lovely collection by any standards and definitely worth the visit
38,4.0,"We went here with our 2 boys, aged 6 & 2.They had a blast looking at all the different fish, stingrays, sharks, turtles and other sea life. They even had some other animals such as Beavers, Otters and Penguins. This aquarium was nicely laid out with 16 different stations. I would allocate around 1-2 hours for this attraction. I think some of the main features of this aquarium are the Huge ""Ocean Kingdom"" with all the sharks, The Fish in Wonderland which show fish in all diferent types of unique aquariums, The Amazonia World which show marine life from The Amazon River and The Marine Touch Lab to where the kids can touch certain marine life. This attraction is stroller friendly. My only drawback would be that this attraction is sort of on the pricey side with adults costing 25,000 each, youths 22,000 and children (3-12) 19,000 krw."
39,5.0,"This was our second visit to the aquarium.  Hours of wonder and fun with the fish and other animals, including the otters, beavers, penguins... My teenage son still loved the squirrel most, but we all enjoyed the colours and tranquility of the aquariums.  Well worth the visit."
40,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised that Coex Aquarium can rival the SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  Considering that Coex Aquarium was inside a mall, we did not expect much.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was very modern and had as much attractions as SEA Aquarium in Singapore.  They even had penguins and huge sharks which my kids really enjoyed watching.  And for its price, it was well worth it!"
41,5.0,This place located within the Coex Center is one of the must-sees in Seoul. They have a vast variety of species exhibited. They provide interactive activities for children. It is amazing how clean and maintained the aquariums are.
42,5.0,"Coex Aquarium is a combination of Marine Fish & Brackish Water fishes in the Amazon jungle. It highlights fishes in their natural habitats able to live together with other kinds. For the marine fishes, there's a section where children are allowed to handle live corals, starfishes, hernit crabs & even a baby octopus. There is also a tank full of Piranhas looking so aggressive & unfriendly. It usually takes about 90 mins to complete everything. Coming out of the Aquarium, you will be able to buy souvenirs to bring home.Highlight is the feeding times when 4 divers get into the water to hand feed the fishes, octopus, sting ray & mantle ray. They also performed some water aerobics to entertain the audience in the theatre."
43,4.0,"Coex Aquarium is fun and interesting especially for young kids. My daughter is 3.10 years old, thus, still free; payment starts at 4 if I am not mistaken. The map at the start of the ""journey"" makes going around more interesting as one needs to complete the stamp from several stops and get a post card after. There are a lot of variety of sea creatures and they eat healthy foods, fruits and veggies! A nice place to visit and takes around 1-2 hours in total. =)"
44,4.0,Enough to see when you want to get out of the cold. There are good signage to each exhibit. Before the entrance and inside there are lockers for storing your bags.
45,5.0,"This aquarium started out ho-hum...then got interesting! I especially liked the 'Dr Fish' that nibbled my fingers. My kids especially liked the touch-and-feel section as well as the microscopes that magnified tiny aquatic creatures. I'm happy we went. Just outside a metro stop - super easy to access. Part of an underground mall, so plenty of dining and coffee options for before or after."
46,5.0,"This is a nice aquarium with some unique features I hadn't seen previously. We enjoyed the uniquely Korean fish tank displays (in a coke machine, a water cooler, a phone booth, etc.), and the sardine show (where divers divert the schooling fish in various directions) is a spectacle to behold. Among the many exhibits is a big shark tank with some interesting varieties and some of the largest sharks and rays I recall seeing at an aquarium. The ""doctor fish"" (nibbling pedicure fish) exhibit was a fun hands-on experience. Lots to see here, and a great place to spend a few hours with the kids in inclement weather, especially since it's attached to a mall with lots of restaurants. We didn't find it too crowded, especially considering that it was a weekend during the cold winter. Note that the experience is linear, so you'll need to pass through the entire facility to get out."
47,3.0,"We visited the aquarium due to the bad outdoor weather and we have a couple of hours to kill. This aquarium is like any other aquarium, plenty of tropical species of fish, sharks, rays etc. The layout of the place is more or less similar to other public aquariums, with a tunnel to view the ocean creatures. I have been to better ones in my opinion. A good place to visit if you have time to kill and you have a restless child in tow. Skip this attraction if you have other places to visit."
48,4.0,"We visited the aquarium at the CoEx Mall one evening before closing.  It was over $20 for admission.  A little more than expected.  We enjoyed our hour going through all the various exhibits.  They even had a beaver exhibit with all the different aquatic animal and fish exhibits.  There are vary many exhibits and the interesting thing about them is the design of the tanks.  For example in one area, there were fish swimming in a kitchen sink.  Also, there is a tank where you can put your fingers in and the fish will nibble off your dead skin cells.  They didn't seem to interested that evening.  Overall, we enjoyed the time we spent here."
49,4.0,"The aquarium was entertaining for the kids. Had a good selection of fish and animals from all over Korea as well as a select few from around the world. There is a section where they have fish in interesting tanks like vending machines, phone booths refrigerators, etc. that were pretty neat. Kids enjoyed the interactive touch exhibits and the sharks and rays."
50,3.0,We finished seeing everything in less than an hour. It's a very small aquarium and not really worth going to. You're better off just exploring Coex Mall itself.
51,1.0,You can't simply put random fish in random containers and call it an aquarium.I really wanted to like this place but this place is way too scattered and sparse in its exhibit to be a first class aquarium.
52,4.0,"Visited the Aquarium with a 3 year old and a 7 year old. The Aquarium isn't as grand and spectacular as some other Aquariums in Asia but considering it is right in the city and above a mall, it is not too bad. There are some fun exhibits for children. Some quite interactive, keeping young children busy. Visit for the entertainment aspect of it and yoi won't be disappointed. Expect to spend about 1.5 to 2 hours."
53,4.0,I recommend a visit to the aquarium expecially with kids of course. It is really amazing and there are also some exibitions during the feeding hours really nice( unfortunately only in korean but it is amazing the same). It is better to get information about the hours when you arrive.
54,5.0,"We were there in Aug. My 11  year old had a blast. You can touch certain fish/starfish and snails. Is not thay big but bigger than you would imagine since it is inside the mall. They have shows, and overall a good experience."
55,4.0,"My four year old and I love going to COEX aquarium. One can easily spend about 3-4 hours in the aquarium. It's not just viewing the lovely displays but also the shows like feeding the Sharks, penguin. You can touch and feel starfish which is fun. I love the display which has the fish that eats your dead skin. There is a innovative section where they have aquariums made with stuff like refrigerator, vending machine etc. definitely worth a trip."
56,5.0,A wonderful place and is located in the center of shops and underground and has many fish and marine life and possible buy toys on the forms of fish
57,5.0,"I've been here twice. I highly recommend avoiding weekends due to wall to wall crowds. Yesterday was a Wednesday and we had a great time. There weren't too many people there. We were able to do the moving tunnel twice. It's popular for a reason. It's a beautiful, creative, innovative aquarium with many artistic and shaped displays. There are lockers to place your backpacks and shopping bags. Inside, there's a snack shop with churros, ice cream, and coffee. There are stamp books for the kids ands touch pool with uniquely korean sea creatures like sea pineapples  in the touch pool. Line 9 takes you right to it. Near PF changs. Go in the mall and its to the right. Conan O Brian's pet octopus, Samuel) is in the crab display! ( he is an American TV star)"
58,5.0,"This is a great place when you are traveling with kids and they have gotten tired of watching temples, castles, markets and other stuff their parents want to see. The aquarium is large with a large variety of fish/animals and good english translations. There is an interesting section on the fish in the Seoul area (Han river) and a great kids section where they can touch some sea shell and fish.Combine the visit with some shopping in the Coex mall and you could easily spend a day here."
59,5.0,"Very nice aquarium with interacting activities for the kids do like touching water creatures.  Cool designs with fish tanks.  Highly recommend this place if you come during the hot summer months.  After you are done, you can walk around the mall which has very nice movie theater, duty free shop and Hyundai Dept store at the other end of the COEX.  I personally like this place then Seaworld!"
60,4.0,"This aquarium is not up to the standards of Long Beach or Toronto, but in a city that's a little short on activities for kids, it's not a bad place to spend an hour or so."
61,5.0,They offer Military Discounts You could spend the  entire day walking around the aquariumGreat for kids of all ages
62,5.0,"The aquarium has a wide variety of sea creatures. It was a very open area for the large amount of visitors and was pretty clean. I especially enjoyed how visitors could interact with some of the sea creatures (doctor fish, touching a starfish, etc.) and learn about some of the common illnesses in fish by looking under a microscope. The displays of the fish are also very creative; for example, one fish tank looked like a telephone box, and another looked like refrigerator."
63,5.0,Good aquarium to visit if you have not been to one ... but if you have been to the one in some of the other places (Singapore/Thailand/China) then you may not find it as special
64,5.0,Beautiful aquarium.  It sure is a fun place for all family members to visit.  It has hands on experience with the fishes.  lots of fun.
65,4.0,For families with children and aquarium lover's this is a must especially if you are visiting Coex mall. Good variety of type of fish. Some local Korean fish. Feeding them is a  good experience. I think the ticket was overpriced. The store at the end of aquarium has some nice stuff.
66,4.0,For those who have time to spend pleasant I recommend visiting the aquarium.Place abundant in fish sharks turtles.The aquarium is huge and been in a amazing mall.
67,4.0,"Looks like small - it indeed small - but with good interior and creative design, surprisingly it's very enjoyable. Recommended."
68,4.0,"This aquarium in the mall, dont have a lot of species of fish compare to ocean world. But the price i think is much cheaper.so for killing time 1-2 hours. This place is okay to visit.Fresh water have arapaima, red tail catfish, sturgeon, salt water is shark, manta and no whale here."
69,5.0,"It's just awesome, kids like it so much and don't want to leave. Every part of it is so attractive with different theme, be prepared to spend hours to experience it. I can't wait to be back."
70,5.0,"The COex aquarium has been designed to entertain all age groups. The money is worth spending. it takes 3 hours at least to cover. As compared to Dubai, Singapore and London, I found this to be bigger and more number of fish types"
71,5.0,"The only other Korean Aquarium we have been to is in Busan which was small. We were nervous about the Coex since it was in a mall. There was no problems! We went early on a Sunday and it was not as packed as we feared it would be. Our little ones, 3.5 and almost 2, had a blast. The only thing we didn't care for where the touch exhibits. Those poor aquatic animals. But since our kids enjoyed it, we would certainly go back."
72,5.0,"The first part is mostly local, freshwater fish.  Don't spend too much time there if you want to see the sharks and octopi--there are lots of those later!"
73,2.0,"There isn't much you can really expect from an aquarium in a mall, but it's disappointing to see the conditions the sea mammals and birds are living in. The fish seemed fine, but the poor dugongs.... covered in layers of muck and so listless. This place is great for kids, but I'm grateful my daughter is too young to understand how bad the conditions were for the sea mammals."
74,5.0,"첫째가 물고기를 너무 좋아하여 연간회원 끊었어요.  3번만와도 본전뽑내요.  볼거리도 많고 직접 만져볼 수 있는 불가사리랑 멍게도 있고 애들이 너무 좋아하네요.  My kid loves aquarium so we got the annual membership which is worth it.  Lots of things to see and you could even touch the starfish.  Pretty decent size place,  not as big as Shedd Aquarium in Chicago but its   got its own uniqueness."
75,5.0,Outstanding aqua life great how it set out and you can watch diver's do there thing with a shark great family day out
76,5.0,"We went on a weekday, so the crowds were minimal, it's a lovely acquarium and the kids loved it.  Would recommend it to families with young children."
77,4.0,"i went there, and was totally empty, it was only my family, its good to give it a quick visit if you are in COEX complex."
78,4.0,"Such a perfect place to spend a rainy day.  The aquarium was nice, a little smaller than we are used to but still very nice.  Families with little children will enjoy it more than those with older.  Another benefit is that Hard Rock Café Seoul is right upstairs from the Aquarium."
79,4.0,We loved the exhibit but would have love it more if there was an english translation or subtitle on the show with the sardines. Because it seem very nice and our kids would have been able to appreciate watching it more if they understood.
80,5.0,"coex aquarium is indoor which is good that you plan to go here during bad weather. foreigners who ride public transportation would past through sm town where you can buy plenty of band items there such as exo, girls generation and so on. coming back to coex aquarium. the price is not bad because of the wide aquarium and types of fishes, sharks and mammals you see. there are also a few stops where you can touch the creatures which is a great experience for anyone at any age :D thumbs up from mee !!"
81,2.0,"It is very clean, and it is very polished.  But.... it is a private aquarium in the middle of a shopping mall.  It is very expensive for a family of four, and not worth the price of admission."
82,5.0,"The Aquarium will take you about at least 1 hour to walk around. Lots of ocean fish near the middle towards the end of the Aquarium. My kids love it especially they can feel and touch some of the sea creatures. Do ask for location of the coex aquarium as its a huge mall. If you are taking a taxi, do print the name address in korean characters."
83,4.0,This is located inside of the huge COEX mall. Path to the aquarium is well marked. Lots of  fish from around the globe. Big shark tank and they had a show with divers. The grandkids enjoyed it.
84,4.0,"I am a huge fan of aquariums, so I enjoyed COEX aquarium. Fish of all kinds is a feast for eyes. COEX also has otters and parrots inside. The only drawback is price. It's a bit expensive comparing to what the aquarium offers."
85,3.0,"There are some nice displays but the huge tank at the end was really the best part, with its large fish, turtles and sharks. There ""SHOW"" consisted of the large tank .feeding It was very crowded and had many children but might be different during the week. There are wheelchairs if you need to use one."
86,5.0,"So this place is actually in the Coex Mall.I spent a couple hours here checking out the fish and little wild life they had.There were so many fish and some of the designs for the aquariums holding the fish were interesting...one set of fish live in a little place that makes music by the movement of the fish.Another set of fish lived in a sink, another set in a refridgerator!They also have a set of doctor fish -but the ones from Turkey, not from China-. I'm not sure why that was important, but there is a plaque next to the wall stating this info.There is also an area for penguins and seals and manitees. The seals were so fun because they kept playing with me through the glass.I would recommend this place for all ages!"
87,3.0,I like to visit Aquariums when I travel and this is a nice one but it is really geared for small children.
88,4.0,I thought it will just be another aquarium but it is nice! Aquarium in the city and they display many modernized aquarium setting.  Worth going for a different aquarium experience.
89,3.0,I saw so many school kids enjoying their visit but to me it was not the best choice. however I recorded some movies to show to my little daughter.
90,2.0,I really advice you not to waste your time as you have alternatives. Yes it is a good place to visit but seoul is a full city with many thing better than this place
91,4.0,The aquarium took about 2 hours. Kids enjoyed the unconventional tanks! We walked around Coex mall and then spent some time at the bookstore. It's a great place to spend on a rainy day in Seoul!
92,5.0,"We had such a good day at the aquarium.  This is such an unexpectedly good attraction in the COEX mall.  It is one of the largest aquaria we have ever been to.  There are all sorts of animals that live in the water here (not just fish) such as beavers, alligators, penguins, otters and huge turtles.  The entrance price is quite high but, I think, entirely worth it.  We did get a discount as we had bought something at one of the stores in the mall.  We spent around 2 1/2 hrs here.  If you time it right, try and see some of the feeding times.  Penguins at 15.30. We found the keepers very respectful of the animals too as they were observing a penguin"
93,2.0,"We have been to many aquariums, this one was nothing special in our opinion. The cost to get in is not worth it. For the price, it needs to be 2-3 times larger. Our pre-teens were bored. We spent maybe 2 hours here. And that was us TRYING to take our time and read everything to get our moneys worth."
94,4.0,Not cheap but worth the price. Had a blast with a family of friends. We went  on Tuesday and we got  lucky because it wasn't crowded and we could appreciate the all the cool  upgrades😊.
95,4.0,"My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and walked along the corridors to the subway often. We passed the Coex Aquarium frequently and made a point to visit before our trip to Seoul was complete.This is a pretty big aquarium. I think it's bigger than the 63 Sea World, we liked it even better than 63 Sea World. There were lots of fish, sharks, rays, seals, jelly fish, penguins, and a touch pool area. There was an area geared towards kids but it was a little bit run down when we visited and not all the exhibits worked. We were a little disappointed, but aside from that everything was well maintained and the homes of the creatures looked clean and cared for. There were many many tanks to see animals in. They boast 3,000 tons of water with 650 species, and 40,000 living things.The place is open 10am to 8pm every day of the year. Even when they are closed they have a couple beautiful tanks outside filled with color fish to entice you to return when they are open.They have an overpriced cafe and a souvenir shop. They are a little on the expensive side at about $19 for adults, and $14 for kids. We saw the entire place in about an hour. Our favorite parts included the Japanese garden type area with a huge koi pond, the photo op type things you stick your head through, that they had a chipmunk at an aquarium, the seahorses, the penguins, and the jellyfish."
96,1.0,50 fish to one small tank. The place is busy and the fish are in tiny tanks. I love Korea but I don't like the zoos etc over there.
97,4.0,"That title is actually true, seriously check it out.Anyway... this place has everything from penguins to dolphins, fantastic shows and feed (i recommend getting there earlier so you can follow the feeding and enjoy the shows. so much to see that you certainly won't be bored. everything from the colourful to the fantastic."
98,5.0,"I have visited aquariums in Indonesia, Bangkok, Osaka and Tokyo. But from my point of view, this one is the best!The place is huge, well maintained, clean, and consist of thousand varieties of sea creatures.We spent almost 4 hours inside, and my kids love this place very much.A very worth visit!"
99,5.0,"I had never been to an aquarium before. I thought its gonna be boring. But this place is amazing, and I loved the variety they have and amazing experience indeed."
100,4.0,"This is a really nice aquarium with many more amazing fish, sharks, and sea creatures than I expected.   We really enjoyed it, especially the large exhibits with turtles, sharks, and sting rays.  Somewhat pricey, but not exorbitant."
101,4.0,My kids both 12 and 10 years old both loved this Coex Aquarium!! they had seen here several sea animals that they have never seen before.. Very educational and very clean. I especially love how they design the aquarium of the sea animals!!! very creative!!! Love this aquarium!!!
102,4.0,"This is not Sea World, but it is the nicest aquarium in Seoul - plenty of interesting exhibits, and it can get a little crowded at times in some of the narrower spaces.  Very interesting fish exhibits from around the world, with some mammals (penguins, manatees, otters, etc) and amphibians mixed in.  Plan to time your visit around some of the live feeding shows - the staff put on an entertaining underwater show in their wet suits and costumes.  The aquarium is located on the lower level of the mall, so there are plenty of dining options right nearby.  Best to go during the week when things are a bit less crowded - the entry fee was not exorbitant, about $20 US for adults, a bit less for teens and younger children.  You can easily spend 3 hours strolling and viewing the exhibits."
103,4.0,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam district, Seoul, is one of South Korea's largest Aquariums with over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. The COEX Aquarium features 90 exhibition tanks grouped in fourteen ""discovery zones"", including six themed areas. The aquarium is housed within the COEX mall.  I particularly loved Wonderland - the home of unusual fish tanks in the form of toilet bowls, telephone booth (yes, the big red telephone booth and imagine it with fish inside)...Wonderland brings together a crazy collection of eccentric fish tanks. The shower-cubicle tank is home to a yellow-bearded dragon fish, and there is a seahorse living in a computer monitor. Put your hand in the bathtub and you will be tickled by doctor fish, from the river basins of Turkey.The Seven Seas features a kaleidoscope of tropical fish while Ocean Kingdom is home to dozens of sharks, rays and huge schools of fish, creating a real sense of life in the deep seas.  We stayed for quite a while in Ocean Kingdown admiring the sharks :)"
104,4.0,"The Coex aquarium is located inside the Coex Mall, on the lower level. It is open till 8pm. Since it is in the mall, you can enjoy many of the restaurants inside the mall. Entrance for adults is 22000 won."
105,3.0,"The aquarium was well maintained. I went during the day on Thursday so there were not many other people visiting but several preschool classes. Children will enjoy this most but adults can still appreciate all the different species of fish and amazing colors of saltwater fish! I have been to other aquariums so this did not excite me a whole lot but my mother had never seen anything like this and was amazed! One interesting aspect was the ""tunnel"" that you can walk through, it is as if   you are in Biblical times when the Red Sea was parted. That was the most interesting part and best viewing area."
106,5.0,"Maybe this is not the best aquarium in the world, but my 10yo and I spent a nice afternoon visiting this aquarium. Despite the fact that most explanations are in Korean, the visit is very pleasant, relaxing, interesting.  The shows are great, the undersea tunnel is amazing...and we especially loved the fish doctors: you put your fingers in a small aquarium, and the little fishes come and clean the dead skin on them. Very funny!  And like in North america, you exit the aquarium by the gift shop...very smart! Easy to please your child with not so many Won."
107,5.0,"The aquarium was different form the ones I have seen in the state, the places were they keep their fish are very unique and everything seems very close you can almost touch them. Nice trip if you are visiting with young children."
108,5.0,"My favorite aquarium in USA is Montreal Bay Aquarium in California, and this one comes close to it.  This aquarium is located under the Coex complex where all the major trading events are held.  With tons of shopping opportunities, restaurants, and movie theater within the complex, it is a great place to spend a day especially when the weather is not good."
109,1.0,"Went there with 5 adult and 1 child (2year old) on Saturday afternoon. We just went there because we had a lunch reservation at coex intercontinental hotel and my mom wanted a place to spend some time with her grandchild after lunch. Even though I wasn't looking too much forward, I was disappointed. It was really crowded and everybody was just walking in line to see rows of tiny view through a small window. However just to give some ways of discount info, it's 22000krw for 1 adult but you can buy discount ticket for 3 or 4 from internet mall in advance and you can save approx 25% of the cost. Children under 47months is free per 1 adult. The annual pass is approx 2.3 times the 1 time entrance so if you plan to go more than 3 times definitely worth getting the annual pass although I would not get it myself. If you have seen good aquarium, you probably don't want to go there but no offence I really wish you have fun if you are going~!"
110,4.0,"At first, we thought it was pricey too just to see some fishes, but behold! You thought it's small when you buy tickets and get to the entrance, but every step that we took and we saw a lot more than different kinds of sea creatures. They also have cute penguins, monkeys and more animals inside. You wouldn't believe there would be this sight just inside a mall."
111,4.0,"I really liked this place. 22,000won per person may be a little pricey to some people, but I did get to see many interesting marine animals. The place is well planned out and clearly labelled. I loved the thrasher shark although it wasn't labelled. (I hope I got the name right.)However, there were many people who seemed to not know how to behave in the aquarium. Adults trying to lift tank covers, tapping on tanks. Children shouting, flipping starfishes over at the petting pool, picking starfishes up and out of the water despite signs specifically telling them not to. All of these are not faults of the aquarium, but I think more staff need to be present to ensure that the welfare of the animals are taken care of. The visitors who behave inappropriately need to be reminded that their actions are unacceptable."
112,4.0,"Visited on a weekend so there was quite a large crowd.Pretty worth it for the price (especially when compared to where I come from) as there was a large variety of fishes to be seen. It was also inside a mall, which made it pretty convenient to visit."
113,5.0,"My boys really enjoyed this aquarium.  There are a lot of unique displays made of random items, like aquariums made out of televisions or phone booths and the like.  It's quite large and has many interesting specimens.  We also got a kick out of the doctor fish where one can stick their hand in the tank and have the fish nibble off the dead skin.  Fun times...more expensive than most of the other attractions we saw in Seoul, but for our boys, it was a nice break from all the history and culture."
114,4.0,"Pretty good.Quite a big aquarium which takes an hour to walk past all the exhibits at a reasonable pace. My particular interest is Salt water Reef which it really was a bit short of...the usual huge tanks with sharks and rays...the usual suspects, Grey Nurse and reef sharks, a decent Tiger a bit unusual in a tank. Good seals and penguins, a great Sea Cow/Manatee/Dugong tank. Quite a lot of freshwater stuff which was interesting but not my obsession...some really interesting Amazon fish including the inevitable Piranha. A handling pool for children with starfish and other harmless and durable sea animals. Really quite a good experience and well suited to taking children for an hour's entertainment. For the Aquarist lots of interest but not coral reef specific which is fair enough. It's not as if you are in Florida or Queensland."
115,3.0,For the ticket price we paid we had expected more. But it is the usual aquarium with a selection of fish and sea creatures. It is not that large and you can finish a walk around easily in half an hour.Again nothing special.
116,3.0,"It is an ok aquarium. I am from the States & have been to so many that in comparison to others Ive been to its just ok. I also think that they are a little high on the entrance fee but that could be because there are so many other great things to do in Korea that cost next to nothing if not free to do so it just seems high. Either way I think its high considering what you get & I would not pay it again. It was also very crowded the day we went & at a couple points it was so packed that you literally had to wait for the crowed to move so you could. But my kids enjoyed it & thats what mattered. Let me say though that there are far far better things to do in Korea inside & outside that are awesome & way cheeper, do those if your having to choose between this or something else. Korea is such an amazing place that offers so much beauty all around & this is nothing special in my opinion because it doesn't give you a taste of the awesomeness that is Korea."
117,5.0,"Given how many mums like to visit this place, it's way too stingy on its lift facilities.. We had to carry our phil and teds with two kids sleeping in it up at least 30 steps so in our second trip we demanded that the girls who work there help us and they let us use the wheel chair only lift.. Otherwise a great way to spend 2-3 hours looking at fishes, sharks and sting rays.."
118,3.0,"Visited Coex mall about 2 years back and was excited to return again. However, Coex was under some major reconstruction so most shops were sealed. The aquarium was okay. Explanations were mostly in Korean, even the penguin show commentary was in Korean with no English explanations. You'd see more river fishes, squirrels and small fishes and sharks. I have seen better  aquariums elsewhere therefore, don't expect too much about the aquarium."
119,4.0,This was fun for my 6 year old son. There was a surprising variety of sea creatures. This is a must if you have kids and visiting Seoul. Well worth the entrance fee. The mall is also cool too. There is a Buddhist temple close by and tombs that are interesting to see.
120,3.0,"We went during Summer and korea is really HOT and humid during summer. Also they don't on air conditions indoors or even if they do, it's at its minimal so it is really stuffy indoors. we were sweating like pigs. Anyway, Coex was under some major reconstruction or something when we were there so most shops were sealed. The aquarium was okay. You'd see more river fishes, squirrels and small fishes and sharks. I'd say go during the cooler seasons and don't expect too much about the aquarium."
121,4.0,"If you are reading this review trying to decide to go to the COEX Aquarium or not, GO. We drove from Yongsan to the COEX Mall (Aquarium) on a Saturday.  Although parking at COEX was crowded, the odd thing was when we left the parking garage was almost empty.  For a family of four, two adults, an 8 year and a 3 year old, we paid 54,000 won (not even a fraction of what you would paid at the Atlanta/Georgia Aquarium).  We had a blast.  This aquarium comes has everything you are looking for in an aquarium, including vending machines, a snack bar, and a gift shop at the end.  Here's a tip - vending machines only take 1,000 won (not 5,000 or higher).  We really enjoyed taking our time and enjoying all the exhibits.  I read previous reviews and thought it would be a small aquarium, but we spent 2 1/2-3 hours inside.  Highlights - underwater walk thru tunnel, the penguins feeding, and the open fish ponds.   We will definitely visit this aquarium again!"
122,4.0,"The aquarium itself is not that big. At first we didn't actually expect much from it except that we had to do it because we had some kids with us. They have different themes like rainforest, etc. which is usual with most aquariums but they have a section where they use creative ideas to present the aquariums unlike the usual glass ones which we really find entertaining and funny. They also have a section just for toddlers and features like fish spa. We spent about 30 minutes inside and overall the kids enjoyed it."
123,3.0,there was no crowds when we visit... at most like 20 visitor to the whole placeSo we had moment of peace seating down at one of the section watching the fishes swim in a relaxing mode.Could drop by if around the area or anyone who love the underwater world.
124,3.0,"If you are coming with the kids,they sure will like it.The location is at the basement of the shopping centre and the air seem isn't so refreshing.The space is small,morever when a lot of kids come together and running here and there,you find it is hardly to enjoy.However,the species of the fish is much better then i am expected,so it is still worth to come here if you are with kids in your group."
125,4.0,"I wouldn't say I'm much of an aquarium junky or anything, but this is the third time I've been to the COEX aquarium, but its the first time I've been with children. Friends of my wife and their kids came with us to the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon. First, the aquarium was packed! Now, granted it was a Saturday afternoon in the middle of winter when there is not much going on, nor can you go outside to a park or anything, so I wasn't very surprised. That said, if you aren't a fan of crowds, I would avoid heading down on a weekend. I have been to the aquarium on a weekday, and its much more relax, with more time to stroll around and enjoy the sea life, as opposed to the weekends where it seems you are caught up in a wave of people that dictates your viewing experience.The kids seemed entertained enough (Ages 9, two girls), but after about an hour of walking around the aquarium, they had enough and we left for ice cream. They had fun at petting section and when they could interact with the fish. Also, they loved the water show in the big tank. Overall its a pretty good way to kill an hour at COEX while shopping at the mall. I will definitely go back again."
126,4.0,"If your legs are tired of exploring the huge mall, you can take a break and explore this unique aquarium. It starts off like a pop art museum, having those little fishes place inside a fridge,cupboard or even a vending machine as an aquarium.but as you move on,the aqua animals begin to get interesting. There are sharks,octopus,seals and even electric eels.very educative and visually exciting especially for kids."
127,3.0,"If you've been to other aquarium in Japan, this one is terribly small and not so impressive. Not worth the money! Entertaining for young children though!"
128,4.0,In is located inside of COEX Mall. Aquarium is not big but very interesting for children as well as for adult. It is better to come there in the morning - afternoon many people go there.
129,1.0,"I went there with my family (my mom and my sister), so the three of us were in the queue with many other adults who were bringing their children there. It might be a school holiday or something since we were there on a weekday but there were many many people around. But in any case, we were full of expectations knowing that this is the largest aquarium in Seoul. But once we were inside we were very disappointed. The place is small and cramped and full of people, mostly children, running here and there. The fishes were housed in tanks with magnifying effects so it got rather dizzy after a while. Maybe because there were too many people, but we were exhausted after jostling around with people for a while. Most of the exhibits were not very large, and the variety of fishes they had were not very fascinating. There was this portion where they housed fishes in ""exotic"" tanks like washing machines, fridges, sinks and toilet bowls (and this section was a big hit with children). It was a very sad sight for the 3 of us seeing the single lone fish swimming in the limited water the toilet bowl had to offer. There was a iguana exhibit too, but it was really too small for the beautiful creature. We soon came to this exhibit that featured turtles and there was a poor overturned turtle struggling with all its might to turn itself over. The sight of the poor turtle thrashing and writhing with all its might broke our hearts but there was no staff nearby, In fact, there is NO STAFF at all in that big place apart from the staff at the food stalls. We had to walk around the place before we found 2 staff (who look like they only provide directions) and we tried to tell them to help to turn the turtle over. This was very different from the other aquariums I've been to before where there would always be a staff beside each exhibit. The poor starfishes in the 'hands-on' area are also brutalised by the small children who pick them up and throw them back into the water (there's no staff again) The biggest tanks in this aquarium are not very big and pale in comparison to the ones I've seen. There was a penguin zone, but it was very small and somehow the penguins inside didn't look very happy. All but too soon, the visit ended. Yes, the place is really small.All in all, I would say to visit this place only if you have small children as they would enjoy the hands on pool and the section where they place fishes in fridges etc. But for adults trying to learn more about the ocean and fishes, and who are looking for a educational and eye-opening experience, this place is not the place to go to. I personally felt that that the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan or Ocean Park Hong Kong were much better."
