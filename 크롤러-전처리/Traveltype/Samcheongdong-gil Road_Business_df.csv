Loved the quaintness of the ambience, a good mix of old (or rather ancient) Seoul with the new. It has sort of a hipster feel to the area too!"

If you veer off to the right up the mountain, towards the embassy of Vietnam, you will find the entrance to the Samcheong Park. Go in and climb up the hill to the pavillon, past the  military fortress, and you will be rewarded with great views of Seoul. In the morning you will stop believing you are near a mega city."

When you plan to go, remember to wear a pair of comfortable shoes. In Seoul, you will need to walk up and down all the time, just like San fransisco. It's a great place to spend time, many shops, coffee shops and restaurants. Be aware that many people still live in the houses, it's nice to lower down your voices."
