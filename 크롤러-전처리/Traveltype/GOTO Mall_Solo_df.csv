0,4.0,"Goto Mall is a local underground shopping mall and should be your first stop if you are looking for clothes, shoes and bags. Much cheaper than Dongdaemun and Myeongdong. The shopowners will also give you new products and not off the racks,unlike elsewhere."
1,4.0,"Shopping haven for reasonable priced fashion , shoes, bags, faux jewelry, household goods, indoor decorations, fresh flowers and Korean skincare/ makeup . the prices are generally cheaper compared to Itaewon and Namdaemun as it caters to the locals. Easy access via line 3,7 & 9. If you dislike shopping it's still a great place to power walk and burn calories üòù. A complete circuit easily covers 600 m"
2,4.0,"Make this your first stop for serious shopping in Seoul if you are looking for clothes, shoes and accessories. The prices here are the cheapest compared to places like Myeongdong and even Ewha. Worth your time to go through the shops right to the end as most shops sell the same stuff but prices will vary by a few bucks. Try the small eateries right at the end, prices are affordable and food is delicious."

They are really fun. The flower market was so much smaller than I expected but what they had was very nice. They had some Christmas items out that were pricey, but nice; Although, I saw no manger scenes or any religious ornaments. I did not try the food vendors but it looked good. There were some pottery venders that had nice things. Accessories, the same costume stuff as in Namdaemun.I also saw Typical korean linen and bedding shops that are in any village. Location: just under the express bus terminal and Shinsagae department store. The website says it's called GOTO mall but I only saw one sign there that said that. There are two parallel rows of shops, an escalator at the end, food courts at both ends, and I saw one elevator at the end ."
4,5.0,"Great place to shop for cute clothes, I bought lots of shirts going at 5,000krw to 10,000krw, dresses going at 10,000krw to 15,000 krw. Got some very nice and cute work blouses too. Mostly for females though, shops for male clothing were few and far between. There were a number of cute accessory shops too, relatively cheaper than at other places e.g. Myeondong, Namdaemun,... Another perk is that being indoors, its a great place to hide out when it's raining/ too hot."
