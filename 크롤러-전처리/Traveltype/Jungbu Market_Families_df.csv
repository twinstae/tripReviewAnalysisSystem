0,4.0,Found this place by change en route to N Seoul Tower.Really interesting. Lots and lots of dried seafood product and we saw some delicious kimci also. Must be yummy.Since we cook most of our meals we made a note to come here first and stock up should we come back to Seoul soon.
1,3.0,Small and nice market to go around and look at. Not so much shopping to do. People are nice and friendly. We lived close by so wasn't a detour to visit.
2,4.0,"Always visit the local markets to get a sense what people eat and local colours and smells.A stone's throw from chungmoro and/or other stations, we stumbled upon this market during our walkabout from our stay in Chungmoro Residence.I found the sights, sounds and smells exotic. All sort of kimchi and dried fish, shrimps and chilli paste. The premises are fairly clean and dry unlike many markets in Asia (they call wet market).Look out for the dried fish all strung up in neat rows... never seen fish (dried) sold like these. You might find a fruit seller somewhere and other stuff in the market. Worth a visit if only you are staying in the Chungmoro or Hyundai residence or other hotels nearby. Not worth the trip if you are outside the immediate zone as they are bound to be markets like these all over Seoul"
