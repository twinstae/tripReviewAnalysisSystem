Really awed by the amount of effort that was put into the displays. It's like a miniature museum that felt so real and if you have gone to Gyeongbokgung Palace before this, it really is amazing.If you want to have some food after the museum, I recommend the very traditional Korean Food after you exit the museum - Jumak. Refer to my last picture, I was really worried I wouldnt be able to satisfy my craving on  Hobak Jeon (Korean Zucchini Fritters) but i found it at the window display of Jumak! If you happen to be looking for this as well, it's at Level 3 of Lotte World Adventure :)"

There was a good bit of information of the different periods and a few interactive parts that we really enjoyed like old games that they used to play and robot-mannequins talking you through a battle or time period. The miniture world was also great to see. It gave us a really good sense of what some of the old markets, temples and castles would have looked like. Really enjoyed and wasn't busy at all. There's also restaurants and a very good gift shop at the end."
