0,5.0,"There are 3 gates that you must enter to reach the palace. It is the Gwanghwamun Gate that is the first gate. It is not the prettiest or most intricate. However, it is the this gate that separates the world of the 1400’s from the 21st century. It seems easy to say but unless you visit you will not understand this juxtaposition. On one side are modern skyscrapers, heavy traffic and the bustle of the current world. On the other side is the palace which when in it appears like it’s isolated in the calm natural environment. It is quiet and ancient and appears just as it was 600 years ago. However these two different environments are separated by only 15 feet of wall. Again you just have to experience it."
1,4.0,"This huge gate is the entrance to the Gyeongbokgung palace, which is the biggest among five palaces in Seoul. A changing of the guards ceremony happens at the gate at 10 am and 2 pm. You can view the ceremony for free. Entry ticket is to be purchased for visiting the palace"
2,4.0,"The gates of the palace, good for photos and specially if you can catch the guards ceremony and changing hours. Check the schedule before coming."
3,3.0,"Gwanghwamun is in fact same location as Gyeongbokgung Palace of the most famous Chosun Dynasty.  To come here, you can take the subway or walk along Sejong-daero.  When you plan your trip, don't be confused by the name and mixed up with other Gates or Palace in Seoul. During the Civil War of the Koreans 1950-53, Hanseong (Name changed to Seoul 2005), this Capital City of the Chosun Dynasty was four times changed hands and all buildings were totally destroyed. Gwanghwamun now is only a replica of the historical site. To visit Gyeongbokgung Palace, you have to enter here. At the square right after, there is a ticket booth that you can obtain tickets to enter the Palace.The square between the Palace Entrance and the Main Gate Gwanghwamun, is the place for the famous Guard Rotation Ceremony show twice a day, at 10 am and 2 pm when you are not allow to enter till recess or finished. To attend the show is free.For videos of the show, you can watch at the map site of Gyeongbokgung or the Gyeongbokgung Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony at my tube."
4,5.0,Great opportunity to see the changing of the guards. Free experience as you pay when you go beyond this area to enter the castle itself
5,4.0,"We actually discovered this by accident, thinking it was one of the palaces. All of Seoul's historical places need to be explored, the culture is amazing and they take very good care of their sites."
6,5.0,Picturesque structure fronting the Gyeongbokgung palace.It can be photographed as a whole when you go in front of the plaza near the subway.Otherwise a side framing will do.
7,5.0,"It is a very interesting place to see when walking in the area, with a typically Korean architecture."
8,4.0,"Great place for photo opportunity, although it can be very crowded. You can take photos with the guards outside the gate."
9,5.0,One of Seoul's best known sights. Impressive and definitely worth visiting. Definitely of interest to a western tourist. We visited it during the Lunar New Year so an additional attraction was the sight of many Koreans wearing traditional costumes.
10,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Gate is a main entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, a must-see for visitors to Seoul. This historic gate and palace harken back to Seoul's Joseon Dynasty while sitting in the middle of a modern, bustling city, and the juxtaposition is fascinating! (Note that the gate and palace are reconstructions of the originals.) There are multiple reenactments held throughout the day, and it is well worth it to schedule your visit around one or two of these. The Sumunjang (Royal Guard) Changing Ceremony was a colorful and exciting experience for both kids and adults! Held at 10 am and 2 pm daily, it is a twenty minute ceremony with vibrant costumes and drumming. Try to arrive about 15 minutes early for a good viewing spot. There are also military training demonstrations and other performances. Even better, the performances are free and open to the public! Check the schedule before going, and poor weather can result in cancellations. After the ceremony, head into Gyeongbokgung Palace to learn more about Korea's royal history. Note that there will also probably be loads of tourists dressed up in hanbok, traditional Korean garb taking selfies."
11,5.0,"This spectacular gate is the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, it is quite beautiful to see from afar and close up, it is not as old as it looks.  A gate has been present at the front of the palace since 1395, but unfortunately there have been many rebuilds over the years, this version of the gate received major restoration and was completed recently in 2010.  It is free to enter through the gate and view the palace from afar or go on to purchase a ticket to enter the palace."
12,4.0,"The building are really old and have a historical-cultural look that really mesmerizing. At the end of the journey, you might have wanted to have another round of it. You'll feel mysterious and full of curiosity on the amazing structure and allocation of building there."
13,4.0,"This is the South(Peacock) Gate at Gyeongbojgung Palace.   At 10 & 2, there is the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony.   You don’t need a Palace ticket to see it.   All the “guards” are outfitted in uniforms from the early Joseon Dynasty and carry “weapons” from the 15th century.    Many of them even sport a fake moustache and goatee.   The long feather in their hats is from quail.   This is designed to show the traditional rituals from that time period."
14,4.0,We stayed near this gate and thought we would just go and visit quickly. The guards were entertaining and let us take pictures with them & even moved so we could stand between them in the one picture. Very pretty at night all lit up.
15,5.0,Definitely schedule around changing of the guard ceremony otherwise it is just a gate with a few guards at the front that tourist get way too close to for photos. The ceremony is about 15 minutes and you get to see traditional outfits and music.
16,5.0,It is a part of the Gwanghwamun Palace. Make sure to see guard change. We loved it. Very nice and you can try guard uniforms for free.
17,4.0,"Few hundred meters away from Tosokchon Samgyetang. We decide to go in have a visit after for a late lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang. I was an eye opening experience if you are first time visiting to these kind of ancient city. It's big, we spent a few hours there seeing the refurbished building from the 13th centuries. A lot visitors also rent the Hanbok from nearby shop around."
18,5.0,"This is a fun part of a visit to the palace, as it offers the guards wearing traditional garb and carrying swords and spears.  They do a fun little changing of the guard ceremony periodically, which is also neat.  Worth a stop for sure!"
19,5.0,"We came round to this main gate after exiting a side gate where lots of tourist buses were waiting, when we had finished exploring Gyeongbokgung palace. There were guards in colourful costumes guarding the entrance. This gate was right in front of Gwanghwamun square and there were lots of tourists taking photos."
20,5.0,This experience gives a flavour of ancient Korea meeting the modern world.Young youths dress up in traditional Korean costumes and have pictures taken outside this beautiful setting. It is a stunning and beautiful sight to behold. The changing of the guard is a colourful and interesting experience.
21,5.0,"We went to see the gate under the night lights. But it turns out it was open at night. Absolutely beautiful and maybe because there's wasn't many people, more so. Something to be said about something so old and then having cars driving back and forth so busily in front of it."
22,4.0,"Going through the Gwanghwamun Gate is like entering a time machine into another period.... the Joseon Dynasty era. The gate blends in perfectly in between the ancient Gyeongbokgung Palace and the modern buildings and plaza across the wide busy boulevard. The area around the gate does tend to get very crowded, but it is still worthwhile to take a photo with the palace guards in traditional Joseon-era costume for a priceless memory of your Seoul trip."
23,5.0,Magnificent structure dominating the square. The guards make it a wonderful spectacle. Make sure you return at night as beautifully illuminated.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
24,4.0,"It's an impressive and grand gate that leads you into a huge square and into the palace. If taking photos of imperial guards is your thing, then this is where you can go to. You may also catch the changing of guards times."
25,4.0,"This is the main gate direct to Gyeongbokgung (palace). Go through there is an offer combination ticket that include 4 palaces and 1 shirne for visiting, price as 10,000 won."
26,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Gate play important role in Korean history and I am not the tour guide to tell you stories here. At the same time I can tell you that it is still worth to pass by to make some photos, especially taking into consideration that Namdemun market is located just a step away from this gate so that you could combine two point of interest."
27,3.0,I can't imagine anyone going here jus for the gate. It's the entrance to the palace and where the changing of the guard takes place. The inspection of the guard is fun to watch.
28,4.0,"Great to see some history in Seoul. Easy to get to from downtown. Can be a bit touristy, but worth a visit."
29,4.0,Nice structure to get into the Palace.  Large courtyard behind the gate.  Changing  of the guards behind the gate.
30,4.0,"This is a beautiful gate, leading to the Gyeongbokgung palace‬.There's a big courtyard behind the gate where the changing of the guards takes place a couple of times a day.Do not miss this ceremony, as it it absolutely lovely."
31,5.0,"Although we did not watch the guard exchange it is definitely a place to visit. Especially in contrast to the modern buildings surrounding it, it sticks out and gives Gwanghwamun square its distinctinve look"
32,3.0,big open spaces to walk aroundlots of touristsnear a train stationpalace gate itself and its walls is a tourist attraction too lots of cops during my visit since there is a protest activity
33,5.0,Gwanghwamun main gate for changing of the guard but because of protests they cancelled it. Still impressive even without changing of the guard also see square.
34,5.0,and get a pix with one of the palace guards standing in the middle of it with the Palace in the background. Awesome pix!!The name of the gate translates roughly into “may the light of enlightenment blanket the world.” The name symbolizes the resounding dedication that the people had of the Joseon Dynasty. Look up on the internet what happened here during the Japanese invasion to dampen the spirits of the Korean people.The changing of the palace guard ceremony (done strictly for tourists now) happens daily at 10A and 2P (20 min) and at the gate at 11A and 1P (10 min.); we didn't get to see it because of snow. Too bad. Should be spectacular because of the colorful costumes.
35,4.0,"Easy to reach by metro, stop at Gyeongbokgung station and 5 minutes walk to reach this gate, outside Gyeongvbokgung Palace. you can take photo with the guards wearing traditional hanbok. From here also you can walk to Gwanghamun Square in only 5 minutes."
36,4.0,"If you have a good travel guide, you will get the story behind this place. We had a chance to see the changing of the guards, not so grand but interesting."
37,3.0,"A beautiful example of Korean traditional architecture, however you really need to go through the temple area and garden to appreciate the magnitude of the area. Really worth several hours of wandering."
38,5.0,"It's the entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace, with some kind of ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. The architecture is beautiful and magnificent. I would recommend of going through here when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is the main attraction.Do visit during Palace opening hours."
39,4.0,"Main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace, you must be present during the Guards ceremony if you want to come back with souvenirs."
40,4.0,"Although it has been rebuilt, the stonework is original, and it's interesting to see where the original city limits were. The shopping district/centres are right near here too."
41,5.0,"This iconic symbol of S Korea was reconstructed in the early part of the 21st century. Royal guard in traditional dress, changing of the guard ceremony twice per day most days. Combine with visit to fantastic palace - entrance is cheap, but discount for seniors with passport ID."
42,5.0,"Amazing view with the mountains as backdrop,always a site to see.Try to make it by sunset to get a spectacular view"
43,4.0,This is a really nice place and it stands out between ancient Korean culture to the fast pace of modern city life!!!
44,5.0,the gate is swarmed with visitors everyday.. sometimes u can take with the warriors stationed there...
45,4.0,The palace was close to our stay myeongdang and went by taxi for 4000won and there was some show kind of thing with actors wearing ancient soldier clothes. It was interesting.
46,4.0,"Imagine you were standing in front of the gate few hundreds years ago, before entering the palace. It would be an overwhelming pressure and you'd feel like a small ant lol. Big thumbs up for city to preserve this magnificient gate."
47,5.0,"We came here after lunch and Tosokchon, and it was the time of changing of guards. It was fascinating as the guards had very colourful costumes, and they are very tall to say the least! You are allowed to take photos with the Guards but make sure you don't touch them. I am unsure if they will draw their swords in Defence as they look formidable!"
48,4.0,"This is the main gate into the primary temple in downtown Seoul. My husband and I unfortunately missed the changing of the guard, but I hear it's great!"
49,5.0,"You cannot miss it since it is on your way to the Gyeongbokgung palace. Careful with the car traffic, especially if you want to take a photo from the middle island of the boulevard."
50,4.0,Good for a touristy picture shot on a good weather. Also try to time the visit when there's the change of guards since it's different from the ones in UK
51,5.0,Connected to palace and a great view for photographer. Beautiful scenery across the road. Great place to visit !
52,4.0,"Gwanghwamun Gate is the main gate to the UNESCO World Heritage - Gyeongbukgung Palace in Seoul.  This is a national landmark originally built in 1395 and symbol of the important Joseon Dynasty in Korea that is worth spending a few minutes to look over prior to entering the palace for your visit.   The present gate received major restoration and was reassembled with wood between 2006-2010, returning it as closely as possible to it former glory.  The base of the gate include three passages, topped by multiple wooden floors, which are elegantly carved and highly decorative. If you time your visit right, you can watch the 'Changing of the Guards' ceremonies held outside Gwanghwamun Gate. Ceremony times are 11am, 2pm and 4pm as of November 2015.  At other times of the day, you can take pictures with guards in front of Gwanghwamun Gate. In the end, this is an important structure and inclusion of visits to Gyeongbukgung Palace. Give a few minutes here to appreciates it architecture and hopefully the 'Changing of the Guards' ceremony if possible."
53,4.0,"This gate is at the end of a nice walk north of the City Hall, along the large square and pedestrian area. Walking there can lead you by several sites worth visiting and taking pictures with, along the way (statues, a big square, etc.). It is very beautifully lit at night too. From there you can then turn right (when facing the gate) and take that big street to Insadong in a few minutes (which is another lovely place to walk, shop, and get a nice Korean meal)."
54,4.0,As every other gates so at night or evening when it's dark and they turn on the lights. Unless your visiting the palace.
55,5.0,If you come to Seoul you need at least a photo in front of this gate. Best is to go and visit the palace inside.
56,5.0,"Amazing architecture that kept the view of the Jeo Sian dynasty.   When visit to Ggongbokgong palace, don't miss to take the good view photo of this gate."
57,4.0,Gwanghwamun is the main gate of Gyeongbukgung Palace.Its great for fotos. It has lots of history to it. There are guards in traditional attire at the gate and guard changing ceremony is fantastic with the dums and other musical instrument playing!Worth the watch and worth the fotos!
58,5.0,We took photos and went to see the outside but it was not open . it was a same . It would of been nice to see inside and they have kept the gates. The walls have made way for modern buildings and modern life
59,5.0,Without going to this gate. Iconic.  Special.  The heart of so many events and breathtaking architecture.  Watching the guards change.  Watch the people go by.  Have a moment and look back from the gate to this magnificent city.  Enjoy.
60,4.0,"if you have visit forbiden city at Beijing, this place was look a like but a smaller. the architecture was similar, and there's a 3 main buildings inside. I loves the lake insside the palace, is romantic and really enjoy to sitting down at the bench for a while."
61,4.0,"I'm not giving 5 stars for a simple reason : it's ""just"" a Gate, and ""visiting"" it takes 5 or 10 minutes. Now, if you want to visit the actual palace, that's another story, but there's another Trip Advisor page for that. The gate stands out for three reasons. First, it's indeed big. Second, it's been unbelievably well restored, with many details, colorful patterns (on the roof) and looks extremely clean and neat, reinforcing the overall feeling of grandeur. Last, but definitely not least, the background. Look North, and you'll see Gyeongbokgung, Korea's largest mountain, and the iconic Bukhansan mountain. Look South, and you'll see one of Seoul's main avenues (also named Gwangwhamun), with its central plaza (and status of King Sejong and admiral Yi Sun-Shin), and Jongro District's ocean of high-rise glass buildings."
62,1.0,"Such as the palaces, this place isn't old, just has been rebuild some years ago. Yes, it's nice at night, but be aware that it's nothing historic at all."
63,3.0,"The gate, just like Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, is just one of the better-preserved gates in Seoul. Of course, this gate is the entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, which would ""teleport"" you back in time after the rows of modern skyscrapers and buildings you walked past to get here. The guard-changing ceremony is actually a free attraction, since it's before the ticket gantry. You can check out the various ceremony/performance times here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=292853."
64,5.0,"This gate is superb. The size and power that embraces makes you to keep looking at for several minutes. I couldn't stop to take pictures to the ""guards"" and thrills of the facade."
65,4.0,We did a bit of travelling to see one of these gates but when we go there it was blocked off. So we could not really take photoes. There were 3 other gates because it was North East South west gates. So we found another.
66,4.0,"Come here and enjoy the view of the gate in front of the palace and with the mountains in the background. Just a beautiful piece of art, a pity that it is a reconstruction."
67,4.0,"Frankly, I have witnessed this fantastic frame of Gwanghwamun Gate just from the main Gwanghwamun Square. The gate and walls of this millennial temple are of rare beauty, but what is most striking are the mountains rising in the background, this image is like a postcard. The square itself is immense, all surrounded by important buildings and adorned by a fountain where children play happily. Splendide also the two statues to make it even more impressive glimpse of Gwanghwamun Gate. Getting here is easy, there is a metro station right at here, in short, not to be missed."
68,4.0,The gate itself is pretty but we went for the changing of the guard and that was worth seeing. It is free and lasts probably 5-10 minutes. I understand it is done on the hour during the day but that's worth checking
69,4.0,"The entire general area near the gate is a must. The gate itself is wonderful and if you have never been to China it will be breathtaking. The traffic in this area is fairly heavy and there are occasional protests nearby. The gate itself is not an original which forces a loss of charm. (Thus the China remark.) But for those with limited exposure to Asia it is a wonderous sight and so easy to get to. The subway station is almost right there, go enjoy have a coffee at the nearby river enjoy your morning."
