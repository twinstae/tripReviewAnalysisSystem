1,4.0,The best time to visit this area is during the changing of guards. It can be quite a spectacle to observe. Make sure to fall in line early to be able to position yourself near the front of the gate for the best view. It's a nice traditional ceremony. May not entertain small children.
2,5.0,"We enjoyed this place and to our surprise it was perfect timing to watch the changing of the guards. The costumes were all so colorful with a narration in 3 languages.  Very entertaining as well as educational.  No need to rush with the photos because they give you an opportunity to actually take a photo beside the Generals!  There are stalls around the place for food and refreshments, take note of a small waffle place on the left where people seem to queue forever!"
3,3.0,Doesn't take more than a few minutes to see this.  Very small and easy to get to.  But still lovely to see considering the heritage and history of the location.
4,5.0,A history site in the middle of bustling city? You just gotta love it. It is free entrance fee to Gyeongbukgung every second Wednesday of the month of free everyday when you wear Korean tradition clothing.
5,4.0,"An impressive gate at the entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace situated at the north end of Sejongno. Aside from being an historically significant gate dating back many centuries, this is where you can view the changing of the guards each day. Once the event has completed you can actually take photos standing beside the guards although you are not really advised to take close pictures of their faces."
6,4.0,we stood by the gate to watch the ceremony of changing of guards. the guards were wearing proper uniforms and the demonstration was most authentic. highly recommend.
7,4.0,The gate is very imposing (as they should be) and wonderfully decorated with intricate designs and colors. Arrive early in the morning to have the area all to yourself.
8,5.0,"While crossing the gate, I felt like I was crossing time. It was beautifully designed and well taken care of."
9,5.0,"The Gate itself is great for pictures but the square is lovely. It contains fountains, statues and sculptures that are definitely worth seeing. Take exit 2 at Gwaghwamun metro station to access square."
10,5.0,Truly an experience to see and go through. We went through to see the changing of the gueard here which was a good 15min experience.
11,4.0,This is Southern gate to the Gyeongbokgung.  It is very majestic and nicely restored.  The gate is facing open square and modern downtown Seoul. A great view of the city.
12,5.0,"very big gate, it is the main entrance of the palace. don't forget to click snaps with palace guards."
13,5.0,"I loved starting here then heading to the shopping street. It's huge and majestic. I hadn't seen the castles yet, so this impressed me maybe more than it should. Kind of a pain you have to cross the street to get there, but well worth it since it was a gate from the original gate around the city."
14,5.0,A great place for your family to take pictures of this grand gate of the past.  It is beautiful to look at and unfortunately you're not allowed up.
15,5.0,"For sure a stunning landmark from Seoul ... it the main entrance for the Palace.It has all details of a heritage attraction, also is well located so you'd like to spend time around the district."
16,4.0,"The southern gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace.Some parts such as a banner, roofs and paçade might be old, probably. But, it looked quite new overall. I would've liked it better if bricks looked old.The southern and the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of visitors and guards. Especially, people come to see the changing ceremony of guards.On the other hand, when the people mention 'Gwanghwamun', they often consider the area before this gate."
17,5.0,Understand that there are several sessions for the ceremony for changing of the guards. We were here at about noon and managed to caught the ending. Not sure what would be the right time to come.
18,4.0,"The ceremony starts at 10. Your perception of a ""gate"" changes with this enormous structure and the absolutely huge yard space after you enter. We entered from the side gate and ran and ran and ran.... We watched the colorful ceremony take place. Afterwards, we continued on to the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace."
19,5.0,"I like to come here every season and get different pictures in different weathers and at different seasons. The government usually provides different cultural experiences for the public, and  even provide a special queue for foreigners (So even if the maximum quota is closed to the limit, foreigners can go...) I love this place!"
20,5.0,"I'm not sure what I should expect as I'd never visited a palace in South Korea before. The price was good, and they had an English speaking tour 3 times a day as well as headphones with translated services. It was cold the day that I went, but still beautiful."
21,5.0,"If you visit Gyeongbokgung, this place is one part of the palace that you should see. Some of guardians stand in front of the gate. Don't forget to watch the changing guard ceremony."
22,5.0,If you have a chance to go here it’s amazing. The changing of the guard it very much worth watching.  Arrive approximately 15 minutes prior to get a good location to watch.
23,4.0,"This is a nicely preserved palace with the interesting parade and guard changing ceremony that should not be missed in the  morning. However, the -5c temperature, couple with strong wind in the early morning make it unbearable to enjoy the place. There is a museum next to the palace which one can visit if it is too cold outdoor. If not because of the weather, I can imagine it will be really nice to walk around the palace slowly and enjoy the architecture and history of the palace."
24,5.0,"Go here after you done visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you can have photo opportunity with the royal guards. Located just in front of the palace."

28,4.0,"It’s the gate to the palace, good place for photography and its on main street with statures and many coffee shops and restaurants."
29,3.0,It is a standalone building leftover from the past. There may be some historical importance but it is nothing special.

33,4.0,"This is the main gate to the same name palace. It was fully renovated 6 years ago, but it conserved the same shape and characteristic of the ancient Korea times. It is a good example how to preserve a country history."
34,5.0,"Very nice contrasting views, the guard change ceremony is also interesting. good for photos and for sightseeing"
35,4.0,"It locates at the city centre, leading up a super wide center part of dual carriage traffic, City Hall, and surrounded by modern buildings and hotels, and makes up a perfect fusion of image. Ancient soldiers were smart and attracts lots of tourists taking photos. It's just close to any hotels at Jung-Gu, recommend to ride taxi , which is low fare and efficient."
36,5.0,"Gwanghwamun Gate, Gwanghwamun Plaza and Gyeongbukgung Plaza are all in the same area and accessible by foot. Just for photography and a taste of local cultural and old buildings. Do visit the palace museum behind, which is free of charge."
37,4.0,The grounds are huge and it can be a struggle if you are with seniors or toddlers. Interesting to walk around during afternoon. Not too crowded with tourists when we visited.

40,5.0,"Centrally located, watch the guard changing ceremony and get dressed up in traditional clothing :) Enjoy!"
41,1.0,We took 2 trains to get to this gate and it was the most boring thing ever. Hyped up to be this amazing gate but you couldn't even get close to it. Not worth it. Nice thing is that the surrounding area is nice. Good shopping and restaurants in area.
42,4.0,"From Gwanghwamun Square/Plaza, this beautiful gate is the first thing you'll see when you cross the street to Gyeongbokgung. Be sure to arrive in time to the Changing of the Guards."
43,5.0,We walked from out hotel and it is very close to the huge market.It's South Korea's Number 1 Tourist Attraction. Worth the visit.
44,5.0,this is an amazing palace with so much history. loved seeing it. definitely worthwhile to see while visiting korea!
45,4.0,"We visited this as part of the palace tour. You really want to get there for about 10am for the changing of the guard, as they do a wonderful ceremonial display right in front of the gate. A must see."
46,4.0,"This is one of the must-go place for travelers. At night, it is fabulous. You can wander around the square as well."
47,4.0,"The gate is located right outside of the Gyeongbukgung and if you are on a tight budget or not really interested in palace/historical architecture, visiting this gate itself would be satisfying. If you were to visit the gate during the palace's operating hours, there will be ""guards"" dressed in  traditional clothes by the gates and at certain time of the day you could also witness the change of guards. If you would like to take a clear picture of it, taking it from the opposite side of the road would be nicer as trying to find the right angle to take the whole picture of the gate from right in front is quite difficult."
48,5.0,"The main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace. If you want to join the guided tour, you should enter this gate. English and Chinese tours are available for foreigners."
49,5.0,this gate seems like a gate to the past to me. once you're inside the Gyeongbukgung palace it feels like you're back in the past. but when you look above the gate you'll see all the tall building/skyscrapers. the view was like a combination of past+present which was amazing
50,3.0,"Got the train there, got our, walked by and walked away.  Another classic Korean building in the same colours etc. as the others but obviously not accessible for the public.  We walked down the road and fond the City Hall which was much more interesting."
51,5.0,It's the gate where you can watch the changing of the guard before entering Gyeongbok palace. Beautiful!
52,5.0,"At the gate, you may encounter the changing guards ceremony which is a tradition for them (rain or shine). It is pretty interesting."
53,5.0,One of the oldest and grandest gate during Cheosun dynasty. It us used to guard the Gyeongbukgong palace from the city. The tourist information area in the place offers free trial of the guards uniforms and even allows tourists to experience the guard changing ceremony.
54,5.0,Very interesting palace to see. Free English tour guide at scheduled times of the day. Lockers to put your belongings so you don't have to carry your bag as the area is very huge!
