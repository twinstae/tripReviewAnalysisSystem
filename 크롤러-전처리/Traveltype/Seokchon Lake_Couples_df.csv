To visit during the evening time - another exotic experience to view the blooming flowers. Also, to see the scenic view of 120 floor Lotte World Tower at night time."

3,4.0,"Lovely cherry blossoms during the Festival in April. However, I did think the whole atmosphere was somewhat spoilt by the presence of the Lotte amusement park in the middle of the lake, complete with various park rides!"
4,5.0,"Great views of Lotte Tower, the 5th highest building in the world and very nice to stroll around. Come on a nice day and enjoy. Plenty of restaurants along the way."
5,5.0,I recommend to be visited during both autumn and spring when the weather is nice. The night view of Lotte complex including Lotte tower from the park is really stunning. I recently visited during cherry blossom season in the evening. The cherry trees are surrounded by special light which makes the walking more interesting.

7,5.0,"We were lucky to have been able to come here during the cherry blossom season. The walkways are lined with the blossoms surrounding the lake. I also noticed an orchestra around the bend (Obviously, I wouldn't assume this is regularly there) but it added to the great atmosphere of the place."
8,5.0,"We visited Seokchon Lake during full bloom season of the Cherry Blossoms. Though it was a Sunday afternoon and was extremely crowded, the visit was worth it when you consider the row after row of cherry blossom trees against the backdrop of the lake. It was beautiful!Not meant for those who just want a quiet spot to admire the cherry blossoms. But the whole ambience is really that of a carnival or festival filled with throngs of crowds and performances and street food; that is its attraction. A must visit during Cherry Blossom season. :)Seokchon Lake is accessible by subway at the Jamsil station, exit 2. From the exit station, its a short 5 minute walk out of the Lotte World shopping complex and to the adjacent lake."
9,5.0,Went to Seokchon Lake as all the Cherry Trees are in full bloom.  It was very beautiful as the paved path has Cherry Trees on both sides.  There is actually two small lakes that is connected and makes for a good walk around both of them.  Also you can see Lotte World and the newly open Lotte World Tower which is now the 5th highest Tower in the world.  Lots of people with families and couples enjoying the blossoms and taking pictures.  It's right across the street from Lotte Mall and it has a huge food court.  Highly recommend the walk around the lake and seeing the sites at the same time.  Very close to Jasmil Subway station.
