0,3.0,A little disappointed with this mall. Inside was pretty crowded and selling pretty much everything including food. But for me it was more or less the same as so many other malls in Seoul selling inexpensive or gadgetry things except with lots of visitors from the mainland.The best thing here is the Line Friends store near the entrance as my kids enjoyed playing here and browsing the store.
1,3.0,"Open from 10.30am till 5.00am - yes, you read it corretly - the Mall is open till 5 in the morning!I was curious who would go shopping in the middle of the night but wasn't about to lose any sleep to find out.It's about 8 levels of shopping with a Duty Free Wing next to it with a similar number of levels - I'm not sure if the Duty Free Wing operates on similar hours.It was full of shoppers when I was there over the Christmas week @ about 9pm.Lots of discounts on offer and a good variety of international brands and local ones as well.Not all prices were heavily discounted and i have my doubts about how cheap goods were but I guess that's relative to the country you come from.There are some couches on the top floor to laze around if you have had enough but have to wait for your significant other half to continue the shopping frenzy. There are also some cafes towards the top."
2,3.0,I suspect lots of tour buses offload their tour groups here in front of the mall which explain why this place is so packed with tourists. You can also find a food court at the basement.
3,3.0,"Just like other mall. Heaven for shopping person. They gave food court. Not many variations of food though, still in affordable price, came in a big portion. I suggest you buy 2 portions of meal for 3 person. There is Arirang shop, where sell snacks and souveniers too."
4,3.0,"We went here for a family outing because there’s a Tayo Kid’s Cafe on the 5th floor. The cafe itself was very clean and our kid enjoyed it, but it was way expensive compared to similar Kid Cafes around the city. We looked around the shops and the clothes were really cute, but they also seemed overpriced. (Not paying $40 for a kid’s sweatshirt, thanks.) It was also a little frustrating that they kept suggesting we go to the duty free store. (We live here, so we weren’t interested.) There’s a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on the 3rd floor with some outdoor seating, which was nice for reading for a few minutes."
5,5.0,"in this mall you can find makeup products and any other things for tourist you can chance the bill to a receipt for tax refund ( i think the place is at 1st floor near the laneige counter) . i visit a place called ""arirang shop"" in this shop you can get discount for tourist and you can get any kind of souveiers."
6,5.0,"Great selection of unique Korean brands by up and coming local designers.. Mostly ppeal to younger clientele who are fashion-conscious and seek the trendiest clothes and accessories.  Carefully curated boutiques spread out over many floors, with many good dining options mixed in between.  Prices are neither the lowest nor negotiable, unlike some others in Dongdaemun district...  But in my humble opinion, Doota is the best one-stop shopping destination for serious fashion-forward shoppers!"
7,5.0,"Doota Mall is located in DongdaemunDongdaemun History & Culture Park Subway Station Exit 14, walk straight out of the exit towards Dongdaemun.I received a free coupon book and complimentary gift using Mastercard from baynaru.It’s a great place to shop for Korean branded bags, clothes and shoes.The food court is also pretty decent.Night time shopping was good. 5AM!"
8,3.0,"Nothing to spark my interest.  A very average mall lacking in “character”.  Daughter liked the kpop stationery in one of the souvenir shops, and that’s about it."
9,3.0,"Doota is one of the largest fashion malls at Dongdaemun Market, the fashion town that never sleeps. Home to over 3 million foreign visitors a year,  Doota is wonderful -free shopping mall and you must bring your passport.There are good deal especially for woman. The mall also offers tax refund services .But,you should bring your visa or you master card.You must go."
10,4.0,"Doota Mall is in Dongdaemun Plaza. You get off at the Dongdaemun Design & Arts Center subway station, walk out of the DDP, and cross the street. You can't miss it. It has a LINE store on the G/F, and other coffee shops and women's shopping for days. The best part about our experience here was the Doota Duty Free, accessible via LINE store on the left side - cheaper skincare than in Myeongdong! I also LOVE their hawker-style food court with two levels to choose from. HUGE SERVINGS for 10,000-11,000 won! There's also an Olive Young on the 3rd or 4th floor for those who still don't have enough makeup and skincare in their luggage."
11,4.0,Used to love shopping at Doota! But have found the style and prices a little disappointing this time round. Perhaps to cater to their new target markets! Also the sales people were less friendly and packed full of tourist even on a weeknight at midnight!! Still worth a browse when theres not much else to do and jetlagged!
12,3.0,"At the central of Dongdaemun, a very convenience place.  However, the area is too small and you have to wait the lift to and from G/F.  Means you may waste 5 minutes or more from 1/F down to G/F in critical season."
13,4.0,"Accidentally went here while looking for the DOTS exhibit. Wide, various choices of clothes and shoes.. but of course be prepared of the cost. Although I find the place a bit complicated for me to roam around."
14,5.0,"I find lots of Korean local designers and Korean brands as well, good design. Never miss 3rd and 4th floor Korean noddles and Korean desserts. Also you can find jewelry, cosmetic and watches at top floor. love this mall, it's kind of luxury mall. by the way, they provide international toilet (toilet with water flush, tissue & automate toilet machine)."
