Halal restaurants also available here. If you want to do a lot of shopping in Seoul, there are a lot of hotels to choose from, walking distance to Myeongdong."
1,5.0,"We always book our stay near the myeongdong shopping street because of the convenience and the endless food and shopping options it offers. You can find all the famous korean cosmetic brands there and the shops and streets are always crowded, especially at night. The street food there is a must try and we highly recommend the spicy fish cake, hotteok( sweet korean pancake), Gimbap for an authentic korean experience."
2,5.0,"This is an awesome area to shop and have some delicious street food. At night the whole place comes alive and it's just great walking around exploring all the side streets and deciding which street food to try next. So many shops to choose from and if you need some comfort from the west there is always Zara and H&M as well. There are ALOT of beauty shops, as there is all over Seoul. We can back here many times and found something new each time to explore."
3,5.0,"This place is just simply the best one in Korea. You can find all kinds of clothing, skincare product, gifts, restaurants, street food, to your favourite Kpop star albums! And they're surprisingly very cheap. Moat of stall sells food from 2,000 won per portion. Although I was mostly there looking for gifts and skincare products, this place is a must visit in Korea. I will definitely find a place very near to Myeongdong Street next time I visit Korea!"

6,5.0,"You would already know Myeongdong is good for getting cosmetics and skincare products. Would recommend you to try the street food that come out only at night. Also if you plan on getting face /body masks, this is the place to get as they are still cheaper than duty free. Not for all products but most."
7,5.0,"A must visit if you want to do some shopping and have street food! If you know you way around, Namdaemun Market, Myeongdong Cathedral, Bank of Korea Museum and various shopping malls are nearby - although Hoehyeon station maybe closer to Namdaemun market. You have to try kalguksu and mandu dumplings at Myeongdong Kyoja! They have 2 of 3 locations in Myeongdong, but best go to the original place (established 1966?)"
8,5.0,Shopping street is interesting and fun for everyone . Ladies are the happiness because we get to buy fashionable items .
9,5.0,"Really enjoyed the food street and all. The place is huge. Some food street is not cheap, prawn is 10000 won. So tasty. Corn is 2000 won only. Enjoyed walking and managed to find good cheap shopping. Masks are really worth it!"
10,5.0,"Filled with cosmetic shops, clothes, cafes, Korean restaurant and so on. Suitable for shopping, dining,hanging  etc.. Very cool during the winter..."
11,5.0,"It was my favorite place to go around and browse. There is also plenty options to have lunch and dinner, aside from the lovely street food! The croissants are great"
12,4.0,"Loved the shopping around here. Everything we wanted for our girls trip. Can’t believe how active it is around the clock everyday of the week. Sales people in the street trying to get us into their stores was a little annoying which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Great food, products and access to surrounding neighborhoods in Seoul."
13,5.0,A good place to shop! There are lots of stores to see from skincare to fashion. I recommend going to Music Korea if you're a K-Pop Fan since they sell albums at a cheaper price! Don't miss out on the food carts on the main street. You'll definitely miss it once you're home!!
14,4.0,"Great place to spend an evening. Many shops with great deals of cosmetic product. At the end of the road there are some multi storey malls with amazing food ""delicatesen"" in the basement."
15,4.0,This is a must do if you visit Seoul! The street food is fantastic. It however gets really crowded and you see the same cosmetic shops scattered all over the place. The staff at the cosmetic shops here are not as friendly as those in other parts of Seoul and not so willing to give samples as compared to past visits; but a still must do when you are in Seoul.
16,5.0,"Anything from high end brands in huge stores, to smaller discount shops, cosmetics, street food - and a great bubbling atmosphere."
17,5.0,It’s definitely one of the most attractive street for shopping in Seoul and it’s highly recommended especially during the sales time. The shops open till 11 PM and most restaurants open till mid night. It’s good place for hanging around with friends and family especially during  both the weekdays and weekends. Some goods are sold with a very good price and recommended to buy during sales and reduction session.
18,5.0,"I spent 9 days in Seoul and must have gone to Myeongdong 3 or 4 times, I loved everything about this place, specially the night market with loads of good food. Definatly one of the best neighborhoods in Seoul."
19,5.0,The best place for shopping and food in seoul but more expensive than other streets in seoul..but it's really nice.
20,4.0,"The place was swarming with tourists and locals alike, but the dizzying scene was compensated by the delicious street foods and a plethora of shopping options. Then again, food prices were too pricy. Anyway, if you're in for your first experience in Seoul, this area should be one of your first destinations!Also, there is a tourist information center just near Myeongdong Catheral where you can ask for directions of money exchange shops, luggage coin lockers and the like. The guides directing us were really friendly and willing to help."
21,3.0,"Please make sure you compare prices before you make your decision to buy.  Prices vary double.I bought some nuts in a shop which offered tasting. (It looked like special store), it costs W6,300 each.  I picked few bags with different flavours and paid.Once I stepped out and walked to the next shop which offered buy one , get one free.Another similar experience was happened in Namdaemun market, I bought 2 packs of stainless steel chopsticks at W5,000 each, at the next shop ( just 3 steps away), it costed W10,000 for 3 packs. This experience told me that I need to compare  prices in different shops before I make final decision to buy."
22,5.0,"If you want to shop, eat, drink or just watch the hectic Seoul world stroll by then this is the place for you. There is so much activity, lights, people but it is all safe and interesting. A highlight was the Korean Fried Chicken and beer - I am not a shopper."
23,5.0,Highly recommend those who are interested in shopping (clothing/cosmetics) to stay in the area. The street comes alive at night when the food vendors push out their carts. Avoid the overly westernized foods as they are pricey and not very tasty. For those purchasing face masks/beauty make sure you shop around the same product can vary as much as 50% from a different store. Dr Jart masks are a must buy.
24,5.0,"If you like shopping and street food, this is the place to go. Tons of food choices from sweets, fried chicken, churros, meats, seafood, etc, and lots of local foods you won't see anywhere else. It all smelled delicious even though I couldn't sample any of it because of food allergies. The shopping was just as extensive with both mainstream retailers everyone knows, to local stores, to carts with ""authentic"" goods. Lots of people during the evening, but grest for people watching. Most full service restaurants here are inside the buildings that line the streets on the second or third floors. Just a fun area to go and explore."
25,4.0,"It's a best street shop for food and drink and sweet ,, cofeThe street have a shops and both they sell every thing You can spend 5 ,6 hours"
26,4.0,"I visited the night market and it was quite a pleasant walk, just looking at things. This place sells mainly skincare, clothes and street food. The variety of skin care brands and products is so wide but I did not buy anything. Mainly because I was not sure which ones are good and they all look the same to me. But if you are a big fan of Korean skin care, this may be a place to visit. Street food is nice but not fantastic. My overall experience is good. The place is vibrant and busy, the weather was cool and comfortable when I was there. I am not really a night market person but I really enjoyed my walk, looking at things and people."
27,5.0,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered.  As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended."
28,4.0,"Great place to buy local souvenirs, Korean  cosmetics, bags/shirts etc and you can bargain! If you're lucky they even give you up to 20% disc."
29,4.0,"Lots of food and items to buy for yourself or souvenirs. I recommend you to buy almonds, cosmetics and clothes if you come here. Dont bother about the restaurants because you will want to try all the street food stalls. The food stalls is not good as Japanese or Taiwanese stalls but they are good nonetheless."
30,4.0,"A lot of skincare shops along the shopping street, with lots of streetfoods to check out the place well and for you to shop.Myeongdong is located at Line 4. Easy to find with Subway app and Rome2rio app locator.My second time in Myeongdong street and its better to travel with your friends and family! But at your own risk since its very crowded and you might get lost. Be sure to know your meet up points in case you are lost.Be careful also to the sales person who pulls you to buy their product. Be alert!"
31,4.0,"Skincare, cosmestics, stationeries, phone accessories as well as some trendy clothings. Most shops offer immediate tax refund, if not, you can try to locate kiosks to do so. You can save more if you buy in bulk with lots of free gifts offered. Tired of shopping? There are many casual eateries and even street food at night."
32,4.0,"If you never see what's night market, then this is the place. You can try all kinds of Korean street food. You can shopping at all kinds of shops. But, be careful if you have young children as they will get lost as it is very crowded during weekends."
33,4.0,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain.  We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics."
34,5.0,"Skin care stores are all over and you will see their chains on the next block.  So don't worry about finding one particular location. Some products irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin so test before you buy.  We went on a Monday,  after 4pm, you will see food stalls on the street. Must try the food!!! They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby,  one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable. If you need another luggage you can also get it here for all the stuff you buy.  Right next to subway line 2 and 3 too."
35,5.0,"If you want to shop this is the place. We only went for a browse, but you could find anything you needed here."
36,4.0,It was very busy with lots of people but lots of good street food. There is an endless amount of shops to shop in. There is something here for everyone no matter your age. I enjoyed it a lot.
37,5.0,"They have all the ladies (and men's) beauty products. They also have cheap restaurants, outlet stores, and other shops. This place is massive and the layout is confusing but who cares! I'm loving it."
38,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here."
39,4.0,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture."
40,4.0,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff"
41,5.0,"Best street for food and shopping, u will find alot of delicious food in the street which u can grape and eat while u r shopping. Such as shrimps, fish icecream, lobster, egg sandwich... and alot more.This street is full of beauty shops. Mostly makeup and face masks."

51,4.0,"First off: cosmetics, you will find soooooo many brands and they have at least two to three shops in the area, so if what you're looking for is not on one shop, find the location of the other shop of the same brand. There is a tourism office near a big Global Tax Free department store and a money changer along MyeonDong Gil Street. You can get your map there.Tip: Get the freebie and enter the shop. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll buy. They give free face mask to the people who will enter the store.Next is the street foooooodss.. the main street is full of different street foods which are must try. We literally went from one stall to the other. Their skewers are great and they have lots of delicious stuff cooking.. If you like to explore street food, try everything out. Especially their very high ice cream. 52cm they say.Tip: find the ice cream store near Pretty Skin Shop in  MyeonDong Gil St. it only cost 2000KRW other ice cream stalls have higher price.Cafe: there is a Meerkat cafe in the area. You can experience cuddling a meerkat by buying drinks which includes the entrance fee. or you can rest in some other cafes (there are many cafes you could choose from)Traditional food experience: you may want to go down the smaller alleys near the exits of the area to experience traditional korean food at a cheaper price in a homey atmosphere. We have eaten at a small underground canteen (can't read the signboard) which serves food for as low as 5000KRW with big servings good enough for two people.Best time to go is in the afternoon to evening, but it is also the busiest."
52,5.0,A must visit when travelling to Seoul.  A great place to sample Seoul's street food.  A nice place to shop too..
53,5.0,Nice placeShop for cosmetics some shops offer tax refund and discount with a minimum 30-50k wonStreetfoodsBranded shopsBakeryRestoThe cathedral is located here
54,4.0,And shopped a lot too. Be sure to get a map from the people wearing a red shirt since there are many alleys and you may get lost. Lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. There are some kpop merchandise too.
55,4.0,beauty products everywhere. You can get tons of freebies from beauty shops just by walking down Myeongdong. Lots of street food as well but a bit more expensive compared to other place.
56,4.0,"My friend and I were staying close by and we walked through the Myengdong Shopping Street daily. It was fun to people-watch and see the street foods for sale. We felt safe (as two women) walking around here, even at night."
57,5.0,"This Street Market has many exits. My preferred exit is number 6 because it is right where Uniqlo is. However there are many street foods which really come out more at night. Is street food is not your thing then there are good restaurants scattered throughout as well as shops for clothes, facial products, or souvenirs. If you are walking all day I would recommend getting a foot massage as that really helps to recharge your feet to continue shopping all night long."
58,5.0,"Usually am not a fan of shopping but Myeongdong had many shops that sell nice food, interesting souvenirs and clothes to be brought home as souvenirs. Possible to spend the entire night here and yet not walk finish."
59,5.0,"For those interested in Korean beauty products, this is the place to go to. Shops open as early as 9am and close as late as 1030-11pm. It may be best to check out the different shops first and see what their promotions are so you can compare as this can differ from shop-to-shop. However, the downside though is that one promotion given today may be gone or be different tomorrow. Most shops can already refund a certain amount of the sales tax if you meet a certain amount so no need to do this in the airport. This is also the best place to get Korean street food, from fried/griiled food products to desserts. The sellers open at around 4-5pm and close at about 10pm. There are also proper restaurants/coffee shops at every corner so you will definitely not go hungry or thirsty. It is best to bring your own shopping or reusable bag so you don't have to pay for a bag from the store."
60,5.0,"This is the most popular places now in Korea shopping district, you could see plenty of beauty shops around the area especially selling masks , cosmetic etc. At night time you can try alot of local food as see in the pictures. Beside that, there is also under pass shopping if happened rainning day you still can continue shop.There are a lot of hotels surrounding, therefore it's convenient to book a hotel nearby. Subway station also just near the area easy to travel to other locations. Bus station to airport also available in walking distance from nearby hotel.Overall, a good area in Seoul."
61,5.0,"This is a long stretch of street market where you can find streetfood everywhere from seafood, meat, chips, strawberries, grilled food, etc. There are lots of skin care shops from Nature Republic, Missha, Tony Moly, Etude, etc and lots for shops for clothes, shoe and some souvenir items. The skin care shops offered lots of freebies and the prices are way cheaper as compared to prices of the same brand in shops here in the Philippines. If you dont like streetfood, there are also lots of restaurant. Good to try this place. We went here for 2 nights."
62,4.0,"Even though I hate crowded places I find myself going to Myeongdong quite often. That’s because I really like the big H&M and Forever21 stores there. Also, I guess there’s no better place if you want to buy a variety of korean cosmetics in one place. Plus, you can try many street food there. What I don’t like about Myeongdong, except for the crowds, are people advertising their makeup store with giving you “free” masks or so.. Guys, these are no free unless you buy something from their store. And the other thing is that there’s really no good restaurant there."
63,5.0,A good place for shopping and food. Staying near this busy street is easy for us to shop and eat. Enjoyed our shopping but realised that the shops there are selling similar stuff and so much of their touting.
64,4.0,"I don’t know if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before about Myeongdong. If you aren’t into skin care, cosmetics, fashion and Korean interpretation of current trends, visit the place anyway to experience the crowds, sample street foods and pop into the cat/dog/ferret cafes in the area."
65,4.0,"My friend a and I loved wandering the streets of Myeongdong. At night the food stalls provided the ideal opportunity the try lots of different things without spending a fortune! There’s lots of lovely outdoor bars, Korean BBQ restaurants and ‘chicken and beer’ places. Shopping is good too - Korean and American/European shops as well as places to buy souvenirs. Great fun!"
66,5.0,Went to eat at Myeondong noodle restaurant three times.  Serving is fast.  Enjoyed the street food market at night and shopping with all the neon lights making the place well lighted and fun to walk around.
67,4.0,"I enjoyed shopping here for 24K Gold, Caviar, and Snail ingredient skincare products. Most shops-Too Cool for School, Holika Holika, Missha, etc we’re having a sale, buy two get one free, etc. I did my research online first and if the shop sale was offering a better deal then online I snagged it. I didn’t care for the constant harassment grabbing my arms and hands to force me into entering certain skincare shops (Pink?, Skin Food, etc), but a very stern “NO” helped. I enjoyed Myeondong shopping and street food vendors; my favorite was hands down the grilled lobster tails with cheese. Definitely worth $15,000 won."
68,4.0,"There is so much to see here. Especially the food is great! There are many shops too, mostly cosmetics stores."
69,5.0,This shopping street is a perfect shopping street for those who like to shop and eat at the same time without having to go any other places    Can find a types of food and many cosmetics and skin care and some good brands
70,3.0,The street food is great. There's a lot of places to shop especially if you're in to K-Beauty. However I would skip this place if I don't have time. Myeongdong isn't that unique - there's plenty of shopping districts like this all over the world. Most of the shops are targeted for Chinese costumers and it's always overcrowded. If you like the atmosphere I recommend Insadong or Hongdae instead.
71,4.0,"This is one of the most popular shopping district in Korea for tourists. Many tourists come here to try the street food, and shopping. This area is famous for yummy street food, from the start of the station exit 8 or 9 all the way straight down to the shopping areas. You can eat, get a massage, see lots of cafe, and eat desserts here. You can rest, and shop as you go; because there are many cafes around. Go here for some food and shopping fun!!!"
72,5.0,"The street was crowded but clean. The shops were all kind. My friend got sleepy in the shop, and the they quickly came and asked if my friend’s conditions was ok or not. Very hearty experience"
73,5.0,"Had a lot of fun shopping, especially at all the K-Beauty stores.  It was a really miserable day to go sightseeing, but a perfect day to go shopping.  The streets did not disappoint!"
74,5.0,Wow. It was fantastic n with so many shops and people it makes it a bit hard to walk around and choose the shops there. You have to check one by one to make sure what is the best that you can get and it can really gets you tired😁😂. But it's worth it😍😍😍. For Malaysia n Muslim lookibg fir halal food there is a Malaysian restaurant naned Restaurant Kamoungku. The menu is delightful and at quite a reasonable price. Im sure to be back again at the Myeongdong Street Market
75,5.0,"The place though congested is the best place to shop your loved make ups..You don't need to complete walking around., you can find your best items anywhere."
76,5.0,"2nd time visited Myeongdong Shopping Street. Myeongdong Shopping Street is an all in package for beauty products,shoes,bags and street foods. even they have an underground shopping for kpop fan not oly for kpo fan :) but it was really nice that you can roam around and don't bother on getting bored :)"
77,4.0,"This shopping street is meant for the ladies, really, with cosmetics outlets all over. The night shopping sees more life with food stalls selling all kinds of snacks . The food outlets and cafes can be found at the side streets and are plentiful. Be prepared to queue to get in, which seems to be a standard practice here. All the stores have mandarin speaking sale staff who can converse in English too. So much of the bargaining can take place quite comfortably."
78,5.0,"As a keen lover of Korean Beauty, this was HEAVEN! The prices are much cheaper than back home in Australia and there is so much variety! A quick google told me the “must haves” and these were so easy to find.Olive Young is like a Korean version of Priceline that we have in Australia and there are great brands available there and many sales or promotions going on. If you like skincare and cosmetics, THIS is the area you need to shop in!"
79,5.0,"Myeongdong is absolutely batshit, and in the best way. It's crowded and lively, with a bewildering selection of shops, cafes, and restaurants. There's underground shopping as well as street-level, but don't forget to look up: most commercial buildings in Seoul have shops on the second, third, even fourth floor. If you're looking for skincare, nearly every top Korean chain has multiple stores here. You'll find Western fast food, international restaurants, Korean BBQ and dumpling places. Anything you could possibly want to eat is somewhere in Myeongdong. Some of the best K-pop music stores are here, as well. Plus a big movie theatre. You could spend days here and not see everything. When you need a break, sit and relax a while in a tea cafe. And then, as evening comes along, start all over again, because at night, the broad main streets become packed with vendors selling souvenirs, gadgets, and every conceivable kind of street food you've ever heard of. Fair warning: a lot of it can be greasy and messy, and there are very few trash cans. But most vendors will take your discarded napkins and skewers and dispose of them for you when you buy your next treat from them. And it helps to have extra napkins and perhaps hand wipes handy. The digital screens and neon everywhere are dazzling, and people-watching is delightful. Have fun!"
80,4.0,"There’s all kinds of street food, endless rows of skincare and make up shops and shops that sells cute socks and accessories. I actually went there with zero intention to buy anything but still ended up with skincare and socks for family and friends. If you’re looking to purchase Korean skincare, this place is great. There is sometimes good deals like ‘buy 1 free 1’ deals and always ask the sales people for free gifts and samples. Also remember to ask them for tourist tax refunds."
81,5.0,"Yes, it was touristy, but we LOVED it! We went with a group of young ladies who loved the beauty and clothing stores. My husband and I enjoyed the street food the most and spent our time eating while waiting for them. We ended up visiting it several times on our trip to Seoul."
82,4.0,"As per title, myeongdong street is popular with thousands of fashion line, food,kpop goods and many more. But bear in mind, that these item nevertheless a quite pricey esp if you don't know how to bargain. They been selling almost similar item from one stall to another. But its a fun street to explore thou! But, i found if you plan to shopping and still find it reasonable, go to their myeongdong underground shopping centre! similar items up there slightly cheaper and more CHOICES. hehe. You can buy something for everyone besides keychain, their collections of socks is amazingg. from disney cartoon, nickelodeon you name it.The material is nice and only 1000k a pair. Happy explore!"
83,5.0,"This is definitely one of the places where tourists should go! It has nearly everything.. From shops to stalls. Even cute cafés! For the Muslim travellers, there are also some halal food vendors so there is no need to worry. Best time to visit would be during the afternoon, in my opinion. And the stalls are usually up by late afternoon as well. Its also a nice place to just walk around and window shopping as well!"
84,4.0,"Before my visit, i always imagined Seoul exactly that it looks like in Myeongdong street. When i first time saw this amazing night street view of Seoul I ultimately fall in love with this. People always have some expectations about something. I had about this asian metropolis city own expectations. And when the time has come i saw it, i felt it...P.S.: i think, it is better to visit this place when the Sun goes down."

86,4.0,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a shoppers' paradise especially for skin care and make-up products. The shopping area mainly features Korean brands like Etude zHouse, Tony Moly, Missha, etc. We bought Tony Moly skin care products for anti-aging and skin peeling and also cushion powder. During our visit, Tony Moly was on sale. It was good buy. And we found out that the Tony Moly products we bought in Myeongdong are not available Tony Moly here. At 4 pm, street foods lined up Myeongdong streets. And this made our Myeongdong shopping adventure more enjoyable."
87,4.0,"One of the most popular places to shop in Seoul. I like getting cosmetics and skincare here because most of the brands are in this area. Every shop is almost a skincare/cosmetics store which makes it really convenient.In the evenings, the food stalls start to pop up. Walking down and sampling street snacks is always fun. Myeongdong is quite a touristy place especially at night with the crowds."

111,4.0,"Very close to the Myeongdong Cathedral there is this bunch of streets full of shops restaurants and street food stalls. This neighbourhood is beautiful and you may want to visit this few times while you are in town. The place is very crowded at every hour of the day and night. You will be surrounded by smells and flavours while walking along the main streets as well as noise and people from shops inviting you in. Street food is very cheap and typical Korean, l noticed quite a lot of difference between one stall or the other therefore pay attention to details when you pick one and eat there. Personally speaking l could not miss to stare at the frying oil as most of them have been frying stuff for the entire day and it is dark and smelly and unhealthy but that is everywhere and not only in Myeongdong after all. Perfect for shopping and great place to buy some little gifts from Seoul."

124,5.0,I don’t need to write very long story for this place because anybody knows this famous shopping market. If you want to eat and shop till drop this place is the best. Some store open until 11 pm even midnight. But you have to selective because too many store there. My fave store is Lala Mart. iIt looks like a mini market with yellow sign but they have many various things that you might wanna buy and cheaper than other store. You can buy various snacks or anything for souvenirs.
125,4.0,Very very crowded street. Lots of shops for skin care products and clothing. All kinds of street food available if you are a non-vegetarian. One can easily spend 3/4 hours shopping and enjoying the street food.
126,4.0,"I recommend some of you to check out the store beside the DeliManjoo. It’s inside the Myeongdong station and offered the cheapest snacks so far (01/03/2019). And try DeliManjoo while you’re at it too! Or maybe if you want bigger and more choices, King Mart will do. I don’t recommend buying at the other places because they were expensive, as per the comparisons we made. We almost went to every shop we can (because it’s cold, and we need to warm up. Kidding.) and you’ll be very surprised to find yourself buying things cheaper as compared to buying it in your country. In our case, it was JPY:KRW which is 1:10.The food was awesome, by the way. The snail was kinda hard to chew, in my opinion though. Some of ‘em don’t know how to speak English though but patience is a virtue. Anyway, I recommend you to ask for the price first before eating 😂😂"
127,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is a vibrant place where this is a shopping haven for shopaholics. The place is lined with korean clothes and accessories from bags, socks, and souvenirs.

It is in the middle seoul that can be access with a taxi or train."

131,4.0,"Had the absolute best buttered prawns here. Don't be fooled by the street market appearance. Some of the food sold by the stalls here can even qualify for a Michelin star! So much variety from seafood, to pancakes, to traditional Korean food. Lots of cheap, imitation clothes too."
132,4.0,I kind of live the night market because they have a lot of local food at one place... its easy to find halal food too if you walk and looking up the shop lot coz most of the restaurant is at second or third floor.But the price is a little bit pricy.

You can find all major brands here and then some - including Innisfree,  Etude House, TonyMoly, etc. Try to visit the Line Friends store with the famous photo opportunity with their giant bear. There is also a muti-story Daiso (kind of like a Korean dollar store, but not everything is a ""dollar"") and Lotte Store (department store).Definitely try the street food for some fun food options. Korea is also known for their character socks (like super hero socks, Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, etc.) that are sold for about $1-3 USD (or about 1,000-3,000 Korean won).This a good place to wander around for a half or full day. Also a good place for some Korean souvenirs."
137,4.0,I walked around the area with a friend on a Friday night. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants in the area as well as many shops of different kinds - even underground shopping too. There are some bars as well but definitely more known for its food and shopping.
138,5.0,"A buzz of activity - with loads of food stalls, shops and restaurants. Also seemingly more organised than Taipei’s night markets and better spaced out - ie you still have some personal space. Depending on what you are looking for this could either be a treasure trove of noises/smells/shopping/people watching or it could be boring. I dare say that if it’s the latter you wouldn’t be minded to venture to this district. I would hesitate to call it a shopping street as that sort of implies a single street - it’s not - It’s a sizeable shopping district."
139,5.0,Everthing you need is at Myeongdong... I was staying at Hotel Price which just across the street. I suggest you spend at least 2 trip there( I went Myeongdong for 3 night straight) as the 1st Trip...check price before buy...next trip buy all you can carry.
140,3.0,It is safe with easy access by train or cab.Lots of shops selling the famous Korean masks.Stick with the brand Innisfree.Lot of food carts around. Not so good for vegetarians.Spoken English is limited.Good bars too.

143,4.0,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund when shopping."
144,4.0,"Be ready to be accosted by free sample giving shop assistants and be ready to be wowed by all the products on offer. Before you buy anything, do check out this shop Baviphat, they have good discounts for some of the popular brands. Sometimes even 50%, I know, amazing right? Obviously I bought a lot :)"
145,3.0,So I went to myeongdong area with a friend to shop fall/winter clothes!! We took the subway which is a very fast way to get to myeongdong! Also uljiro1ga station leads you here! We went around 3 pm on a Sunday and had brunch at myeongdong goya!! Michelin guide dumpling place!! Not expensive which was good!! The stores were a bit crowded but it was not bad. Also the street food is kind of expensive and they only accept cash so that was not very convenient. Almost all stores’ staff speak English Chinese and Japanese which is convenient for tourists!!
146,5.0,"Shops in this area cater to all genders and opens late into the night. From cosmetics, clothings to sportswear, from locals to intl brands. There is a food street full of mouth watering seafood and local food. Many good coffee shops and local restaurants around. The underground shopping is the best among all. For high end shopping one can go to Lotte and New World duty free. Service there was good and can get tax refund on the spot. This place is a must to visit when in Seoul."

In Myeongdong, there were so many kinds of street food such as chesses, Grilled Lobster with Butter, and juice. Also, there were so many cosmetics stores. In there, we can saw alomst kinds of cosmetics stores, restaurants or clothing stores. If you want to buy something during stay in Myeongdong, you can buy it immediately. Howvere the one thing that I was sad was there are too many people to do sometimg. For example, if you want some restaurent which is famous, you have to wait or reservation. Except this one thing, Myeongdong was the one of the best place that I played."

156,4.0,Get off at Myeong-dong Station exit 6 and you can start shopping. There’re Korean brand beauty shops every 5 steps so you know one of the items you must get is face mask and make up. Besides that there are brand and cheaper stores selling clothes and few shops selling Korean snacks - great for souvenirs. Restaurants are plenty too. Tourist assistants are walking around to assist.

There are beauty stores and restaurants.You don't need more than 2 hours here unless you're really trying to do some serious shopping.  Two hours is enough to get the gist and fill your belly.

163,4.0,"Hyper activities: a myriad of stands, restaurants, shops.Immerse yourself for some time, but plan to ""escape"" after some time..."
164,5.0,"As we stayed in the heart of Myeongdong for 6 nights, I can say without a doubt that Monday was the least crowded - also because the food stands were mostly on a break! On Tuesdays from 5pm it gets pretty packed and crazy again!This is the place to pick up all the main cosmetic brands and also a chance to snack on all the “local” street snacks. What I liked about it was that you can find all the big korean brands here so it feels like a one-stop along with sportswear. It’s like the “in” thing right now so there are many sneakers/sports shops at each corner from Adidas to JD to New Balance etc. Highly recommend for all who are visiting!"

183,5.0,"I was prepared. I knew I was going to buy many facial products. In fact, I pre-booked extra 15kgs going back just for my new goodies! My 2 friends who weren't sure what to expect also ended up shopping as much as I did.Myeondong is full of skin care brands left and right, as far as your eyes can see, as much as you can carry or afford. I really didn't notice much else like clothes, shoes, etc. I love all the freebies they give you for every purchase and how every sales personnel knows how to use the products they're selling. Prior to my trip, I watched some YouTube videos on skincare products. I also read lists and blogs so I was armed with screenshots of what I wanted. I found most of them without much effort. I could've tried harder to find the others but I got distracted with Artbox and Daiso so it's all good. Let's just put it this way, my 2 friends who were not as crazy with beauty products as I am said: We live in Innisfree. They're literally in Innisfree every day (we were in Seoul for 5 days) and sometimes, 2x a day. You can't help but consider, look, buy, consider, look, buy. Repeat. :-)Be prepared. :-)Tax refund until 1M Korean Won on each passport. Refund at the airport was very efficient (unlike in EU where there are long lines)."
184,1.0,"This area is heavily populated by Chinese tourists with large suitcases who sit in shops sending photos of items to their friends on Wechat. There's street food, but nothing you can't find in a less touristy area. My advice: avoid myeongdong like the plague - There's better places in Seoul for literally everything on offer here."
185,5.0,"Shopping at its finest! We planned to stay here for only 3-4 hours but when we went there around 1pm, we didn’t left not until it time to go back to hotel to sleep. Aside from so much to shop, from make up to souvenirs, trying out different street food will take up so much of your time. Given the chance, we could stay here all day long. And the photos will show how shopaholic we all are."
186,5.0,"If you're into Korean skincare, make up, fashion and snacks, you must definitely go to Myeongdong ! They have the whole area full of shops and stores."

190,4.0,"This is a very busy street with lots of tourists. If you are new to korea, then I would suggest visiting at least once because it gives you a good idea of what busy, young areas are like in Seoul. Theres lots of options for shopping, ranging from small privately owned stores, lots of chain stores, malls, and even a more high-end department store. Try a restaurant (its a chain so you can actually find it in many neighborhoods in korea) called You ga nae (chicken galbee). all my friends loved it when I introduced it to them."
191,4.0,"I love to shop and I gotta admit that it was really fun and exciting exploring this place in the beginning, but it got REALLY boring and repetitive after like two days because the stores were all chain stores so they just kept repeating itself... the chain stores didn’t have much variation and options either so it gets boring after looking at the same stuff all day. Also, the only deals that are worth it are the ones that are like “buy one get one free” or “buy two get one free” deals, otherwise everything else is sold at retail price and it’s not worth it."
192,5.0,If you love skincare/cosmetics/make up here are the right place. U can buy mask at cheaper price 😍 and also I in love with the saem liptint!
193,5.0,"If you are first time in Seoul and looking to browse for some Korean cosmetics, that is where you should go! There are plenty of shops there.

The best bit has to be the food vendors who set up at 4pm every day and serve long into the night. Everything from ice cream, scallops, chicken, noodle dishes and lobster for very reasonable prices. An excellent dinner choice."
199,5.0,Great fun. We came for skin care. Make sure you research and know what you want. The sales people work on commission and are good at selling you what you don’t need. I have way more than I will be able to use this year!
200,3.0,"A shopping area where there are lots of food stands selling dumplings, shrimp tempura, noodles etc. Can be very crowded."
201,5.0,"This place is what made me fall in love with Korea!!! It has AMAZING street food to try, lots of streets to explore, and tons of stores to explore. Myeongdong was the highlight of my trip!!"
202,4.0,By far the highlight of this shopping area was being given free sample beauty products just for going into the store for a 10min browse. Bulk packs are easy to buy here and make great gifts for friends back home. There's lots of other clothing stores but they don't cater for Western sizing. A great place for people watching. Many different types of food to try. I had both the 32cm ice cream and the flower gelati from Milky Bee. The Rose flower ice cream is unmissable!!! Check out Art Box whilst you're there...it was a great shop full of everything and anything. Take your passport for instant tax refunds whilst you're here. Kpop merch available in the underground subway mall.
203,5.0,Nice district for shopping and eating...can take up an entire day if you’d like.  A couple of malls in the area in addition to the more local street shopping
204,4.0,"Shopping center, whether for the cheap or cheap. Some gifts can be obtained here. Places to eat are also many choices. Easily reachable by subway or taxi."
205,5.0,"this place was full when we walked around on a hot summer day, very nice to walk around, a lot of shops and great restaurants.  Definitely enjoyed myself here, watching local koreans shop and eat at their favorite places."
206,2.0,"My first impression was the chaos of too many people. This is to be expected, as in any other shopping street, but what was really annoying and shocking (at least to me, as a person who has been to a lot of other shopping streets) were the cars, trucks and mopeds speeding through the really narrow and crowded main street. You constantly have to look behind your shoulders to avoid being run over by 4X4 cars, because Koreans do not stop for anybody! I was excited to try some Korean food from the food stands, but I was put off by the strong sewer smell that kept hitting me everywhere in the street. Not to mention the pigeons and flies that were around the food stands, and meat just lying unprotected in the heat of the sun and out in the open. (Also, lots of Korean men hocking loogies in the street). My excitement for shopping in Myeongdong kindled away when I realized that there were at least three of the same brand stores spread around Myeongdong that sell you the exact same things. Store clerks made me feel awful and like a thief, because they followed me around. At one point I turned around to look at something, and almost knocked down the store clerk because she was literally breathing down my neck. I found it really annoying and inappropriate that people working in the stores stood in front of the them, clapping their hands in your face when you walked by, screaming and shouting trying to sell you something or give you ""free"" samples. Also, if you're (specifically a white) female, you might have old Korean men coming up to you asking for ""massages"" with their wallets out ready to pay you. Not as great as I thought it would be - as a matter of fact, very disappointing."
207,5.0,Is very suitable for teenagers.Sell so many product of korea. And culinary (street food) also very delicious.Must try!! Trust me the price is cheaper than other
208,5.0,"This is the best place for people who like shopping. There are so many stores from make-up, clothes, jewelry, bag, and even food-street. In here the brand is not just Korean brand but also International brand also available from Booths (UK cosmetic store to H&M and Zara).For the food street, bag, jewelry, and bag, they required you to pay using cash only. So please be prepare to bring your cash here. But for the make-up store they can receive payment using card and cash."
209,3.0,Went twice in the day and once at night..... bustling area with so many shops ..... but cater mainly for young adults and teens.Nothing interesting for older folks to browse.Food outlets are good and cheap.
210,5.0,You’ll go in here in the morning and end up leaving at night cause they’re about to close already. Time passes by quickly because shopping here is absolutely heavenly
211,5.0,"You’ve got all your favorite cosmetic shops there, so keep an eye open and look for the best offers! They change all the time, even from one day to another so make sure to around before you make a decision to buy something! If you are a Kpop fan, there are a lot of kpop stores but kinda hidden so keep and eye open for them! (They are in basements or upper floors!)"
212,4.0,Go at night for the most action. Street vendors in addition to the big stores. Will be crowded but a fun stroll. Lots of food options.
213,5.0,This place is a foodies paradise. All of the foods that you see ppl on YouTube walking down these alleys eating are right here cooked right in front of you. And the prices are only a couple of bucks an item.
214,5.0,"Good destination for shopping of beauty products. Street foods are good, yummy but not that expensive as you think, :-)"
215,5.0,Has all the recent cosmetics in the shop with new and innovative products. Also had dinner in one of the famous soup places nearby.
216,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, take your time and visit this street! Especially in the evening. Go there hungry and taste the greatest street food of all time. Sooo many things to choose between. The only thing I can warn about is that buy anything from the little street sellers.. too expensive for Koreas street selling 😁"
217,4.0,Really bustling street .. you can find just about everything here. The street food is amazing but you need to to be there after 5pm .. that’s when all the street food vendors start operating.
218,5.0,umpteenth times here and i am still not satisfied haha 😂 u definitely can bargain more if u know more korean and if u buy a  lot! #makeupheaven #skincareheaven
219,4.0,After 4:00pm a lot of street food stands will be open and you can enjoy different types of Korean food. Shopping at Myeongdon is also very convenient.
220,4.0,"Myeongdong is where you want to shop when in S. Korea, there are alot of good stuff you can buy for a reasonable price. What I really love about this place, aside from the variety of things it offers, is the freebies most specifically beauty products."
221,5.0,"If you like face products this is the place for you. Basically the same stores show up on every block, it is amazing they can keep all the stores in business in such a small area. Food carts come out in the late afternoon."
222,5.0,"Lotsa and lotsa of street food. However I find that sales staff from those mask shops are a little rude. They like to give you free mask to entice you to come into their shop. However, if you decide not to walk in, some of them actually curse you( I am assuming from their tone and body language). After a few incidents, i refused to accept any free masks given unless it’s a shop I want to check out."
223,5.0,"They say that Korea is known for their cosmetics and that anyone visiting Korea should pop by the area for some serious shopping!Indeed, I spent quite a fair bit of money on masks and other products. Other than that, theres a lot of good food available in Myeongdong area! Street snacks too!You may/ may not find your way around easily but every area has its own beauty!Definitely a place where you can shop and eat till you drop!"
224,4.0,"The tourist must-go on their visits to Seoul to get their cheap makeup and skincare. GO CRAZY OVER THERE!Pretty good with bustling crowds - adds to the atmosphere. Street food carts pretty expensive. Do not recommend you getting food from there, don’t be lazy, use your GPS and take a short walk over to Namdaemun market for cheaper and authentic Korean food (daaaamn those dumplings, hotteok and bibimbaps)"
225,5.0,Though i was told it was only for electronics .. i foujd almost all i meeded here.. from electronics to cosmetics to food ..
226,3.0,"A great place to experience one of Seoul busiest tourist spot, you must try the night street food here. This place is also the center of korean make up and skin care, but I don't recommend you to buy them because it is more expensive than other places. If you want to find cheaper make up and skin care, go to express bus terminal station or Ewha Univ. Station!"
227,5.0,"If you are looking for a good place to spend the money, here is a must! Long walking street packed with shops, restaurants and vendor's carts. Lotte department store also located at the same area. Totally recommended to wander around even window shopping 😄"
228,3.0,Def stop in to grab your Korean skincare (Ennis Free) but no reason to hang out unless the street food vendors are set up.
229,5.0,"Countless shops! Tourists, please bring along your passport and you get a refund right away. There's uniqlo and daiso in addition to your popular korean brands such as Innisfree, Etude house and laneige. Across the road there is Lotte duty free department store."

231,5.0,"A must visit in Seoul! These narrow streets are packed with tons and tons of cosmetic & skin care stores, clothes stores and street food. It seemed endless and it's easy to spend one whole day just wonder around this area.  Pro tip: there are a lot of hidden away gem above the ground floor shops, so look closely!"
232,5.0,"This street is not only for women but also for men who loves skin care products at a good price. Make sure to bring a large bag for convenience of carrying your products.   Tip for first timers: Tax refund is available for purchases KRW30,000 and up. So cut the retail mentality for a moment and buy all the products you need at a single receipt.Some stores deduct the tax on the purchase but some give you a special receipt which you can encash at the airport. Credit cards are accepted. You have the option to buy in your local currency or in KRW.There's forex fee if you ask them to charge you other than KRW so buy in KRW and let your local card to the conversion 🤓. Some stores are hard to find like 3CE and Labiotte but with Google map it's easy(Just like playing Pokemon Go). Street foods are also a must try.Prices are reasonable. I like the hotcake w/sunnysideup egg😁CosRx,Klairs and other known products can be found at a special shop ALAND. RTW outlets like Uniqlo, Adidas and Nike are present. If you're into socks there's a large store where you can buy everything at KRW1,000each or 11pcs for KRW10,000(it's somewhere at hidden corner 😊). Cute stickers and stationery are inARTBOX at a good price 😁"
233,5.0,"This is a must if you want to experience shopping for gifts for friends and family. So many different stores and vendors. However, put on some comfortable walking shoes.  Glad I did. Ended up waking about 3.5 miles, but worth it!  Also, price compare, cause some items will be cheaper in some stores or vendors. Also they have some really cool traditional street shows with traditional dancing in traditional attire. Other fun places are the tea houses. Enjoy!!!"
234,5.0,It could be a nice area to hangout so many shop especially cosmetic If you’re are fan of skin care you’re on a right place
235,5.0,Cheap place to shop just like Namdaemun Market . I love the area. You can find fake designer stuffs here. Lotsof cheap stuffs.
236,5.0,"Myeongdong is the best place to shop, a lot of skin care brands are located here, many good food also available along the street. Nearby shopping area u can find 2 department store (lotte and shinsegae), that have duty free inside too. Easy to shop when u stay in this area."

Various brands like Innisfree, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Banila Co. and more can be found. Though the stores repeat, the prices are the same and all the stores offer immediate tax refunds upon spending a certain amount. Combine your purchase together with friends to get more refunds."
238,1.0,"I had good experience when I visited Myeondong 2 years ago. This time, I re-visited this shopping street and was totally disgusted and disappointed! The shop staff were hostile and rude. Their customer service were bad too, especially when I asked for more of the same items. They were so unwilling to get the products which I wanted to buy and simply threw them into the basket I'm holding. Terrible service! Even the street stalls also with the similar attitude, and worse! I was choosing some items and the owner simply asked me not to touch it and chased me away! Goodness, I wanted to buy the items yet being chased away! My friend had the same experience too when she asked for new pair of earrings she wanted to buy from a shop and the staff don't even bother to look for it and told my friend that was the last piece. But when we return the very next day wanting to get some more earrings, we saw the same pair my friend bought displayed on the shelf! Will never buy stuff from those shops and from the street stalls again! Terrible experience and shun us away."
239,5.0,Satisfy ur cosmetic and kpop need in this area. Full of cosmetic road and go to myeongdong underground to shop kpop things.Really crowded in evening to night because a lot of food stall.loveee
240,4.0,"A lot of stores, quite a bit of western branded stores with a mix of local. More commercial than local but still worth shopping here."
241,5.0,"If you have visited Taipei's ximending, i would say this is much bigger compared to  it. You will find many brands of cosmetics, fashion, restaurants, coffee places, cinemas and also duty free shops. Many of the cosmetic shops offer direct tax refund. At night you can try all the korean street food along the roads. Careful that you will get lost. They have map to make your shopping experience easier. People tend to visit here more than 1 time. Well i personally go there more than 5 times during my 2 week visit to Seoul. Famous  restaurants like myeongdong kyoja, yoogane, aori ramen until Chinese ding tai fung are there. Of course , you do not wanna miss chicken and beer restaurants. You also can find fashion like H&M, uniqlo, zara , forever 21, spao, top ten etc. It is a great  place to shop and dine."
242,5.0,"Myeongdong best shopping of the year hahahahhaha.. make up, shoes, clothes dll you must come myeongdong"
243,5.0,"Clothes, food, clothes and more food! If you're looking for street food, this is the place to come and do it, while clothes and trinket shopping. You have massive options, and the portions are small enough that you can go from stall to stall to try other things too. Theres very few rubbish bins about to be wary about that. Some of the stall owners will be nice enough and take your rubbish, even if it's from other stalls :)"
244,4.0,"Definitely a place to checkout, even if you don't intend to buy anything, somehow you'll end up with something. Street foods are generally clean and reasonable delicious. Walk out of the main street and you'll find plenty of restaurants, convenience stores."
245,5.0,"A must place to be when you so much love the Korean beauty products.  You will love all the highlights and sale items.  Especially love the friendly store clerks.  I was able to shop in SkinFood and Etude, got me great finds."
246,4.0,"Yes, Myeongdong = street food, make ups (beauty products), accessories and clothing. It's a vibrant place especially at night. Hip crowd, bright lights. This place is just beside our hotel (Loisir hotel) so it's very convenient and great!"
247,5.0,"The streets and alleys of Myeongdong is an organized maze of clothes, shoes, accessories, make-up, skin products, and street food for all kinds of budget, mid-price to high price. With the popularity of K-pop, comes the popularity of Korean clothing styles and Korean makeup.This is the place to be!  After hours of shopping and you're craving some Korean food - don't go any farther. The streets are lined with food stalls and fancy restaurants.  It is Seoul's No.1 shopping district."
248,5.0,One of the best street food experiences I’ve ever had. Everything was super hygienic and tasted incredible.We had cheese baked lobsters and Friend Prawns and Oysters and BBQ Chicken!Also the cosmetics shopping was insane.I feel its a must for anyone’s trip to this awesome city!
249,5.0,One of the center of city’s business area.Heaven for fashion and clothing lovers.Food places everywhere and food are considerably cheaper and tasty.Walking distance from Seoul Tower.Easy access from anywhere in Seoul via Metro and busses.
250,4.0,"Instagram @oppakulinerThe best night market here i guess, i spend my 3-5 hours here to eat some great foods (their gingseng soup and chicken are so good) and accompany my friend to buy a lot of cosmetics. The crowded can be handle because the place is so spacious"
251,5.0,"You'll find multiple stores of common korean cosmetic brands including Banila Co.Brands like Cosrx can be found in Aland.For foreigners who spend above 30,000krw, you can get immediate tax refund when you produce your passport at payment. They may not always ask for your passport so you're better off producing it anyway.The street food can get a bit pricey but it was enjoyable!"
252,3.0,"Myeongdong is always a good location for tourists due to its proximity to city center, many shopping and restaurants, as well as plenty of money exchange with best price.It is a paradise for girls/women as there are many skin care and fashion shops. The shops close late at night so there plenty of time for making choices. The apparent good side is exactly its shortcomings. There is nothing else to do from shopping skin care. It is actually small and one can walk through every single alleys within one hour. If shopping skin care is not the ultimate purpose, Dongdaemun in fact has a design complex which adds a bit more cultural content. For vibrancy and youth culture, area around Hongik University is my first pick."
253,5.0,"If you're up to shopping, this place is a must. Well for beauty products, this is very a must. I still find some buys in Philippines are cheaper but in here they give you too many freebies if you buy just a single item. As for the street foods, the egg bun is way cheaper in Insadong than here. KPOP albums are cheap in here too!"
254,5.0,"There is so much shopping to be done in Myeongdong especially if you are a K beauty fanatic.  Every major brand is in the area so you can really stock up on all your favourites.  Also, there are enough restaurants and coffee places to keep you entertained.  Very touristy so if that's not something you are into, then this isn't the area for you.  It can get pretty crowded and chaotic but thats part of the experience."
255,4.0,Filled with Korea cosmetic shops. All products are cheaper compared to Singapore also. They have different sales promotion like 1+1 / 2+2
256,5.0,"Food, clothes, cosmetics, music... there is everything! Around 6pm the streets start to be really full of people. Went there 3 times in 4 days!"
257,3.0,"When you came to Korea, it is a fun place to go.  You can buy good cosmetics at very reasonable price. You can go to the department store, Lotte, I personaly like 新世界departmentstore.  I love shopping on the basement floor at the department stores.  good food, and easy shopping.  But if you are an experienced visitor,  Myondong might be little bit tiring."
258,4.0,"Myeongdong, a shopping district heaven I would say. This is a must-go-to-place when you are at Seoul. From fashion to food, to cosmetic and cafes, this is like a one stop point!Had the latest trend food - Issac Toast as part of our breakfast and there are 2 outlets at Myeongdong. The one which is always long-queued, is located near Days Hotel, facing road. So we headed to the one inside which queue is 3 times shorter. Had porridge as our breakfast at 多味粥 and it is located at a basement storey. We had our lunch at 明洞饺子 and their noodle is really yummy. These restaurants you many use google map to find them. Do remember to bring a bag pack with you if you have a long shopping list.CheersJazlyn"
259,5.0,"It is the famos shopping place in Seoul who visit to Korea, recommen to shopping here. It is the center of various popular products such as cosmetics, shoes. All the streets in Myeongdong, fashion for men and women The clothes are the most popular brands in Korea and from abroad. I was very crazy to bought 3 pairs of shoes here and many cosmetics for souvenirs for my friends. I thought going back to shopping here again soon. It is cheap and good quality. Ah! don't miss to eat many local foods at Myeongdong food street. Very delicious."

261,5.0,"Getting to Myeongdong Shopping Street is fairly easy, just get off the Myeongdong Station and any Exit will lead you to it, some nearer than the others but just look at the directions from the subway and you won't get lost!You need to come here HUNGRY...my cousin and I strategically planned :) and that means, eating whatever we can on the first night then come back on the second until we have exhausted everything..well, guess what, we never did tasted everything, but I am sure we did abt 98%! What we did was buy one of each from stall and shared that way we're able to taste a lot in one go, we came back for the next 3 days and still wasn't enough. we keep coming back for some like the pastry shaped like fish and had red bean or sweet potato inside..so yummy!! the steak and veg was so good too! it's an experience and a real good one at that. one tip or maybe two:bring water and bring a bag for your rubbish. stalls doesn't always have bin bags and if you're like us who likes to walk whilst eating then dispose of your rubbish well.Myeongdong just doesn't stop with the street food..it is littered with shops,,anything you want can be had here, most specially skin care...and don't just buy from one store, shop around coz you'll see some deals in one shop that you won't see in the next! and when you see it, buy it because going back is chaotic...there's so many shops of the same name and the streets are quite confusing most specially at night when a lot of people are roaming around!Have good fun and eat plenty!!"
262,5.0,"Definitely one of the best shopping and eating area in Seoul. You can find numerous shop here. And some cosmetic shop give customers free mask sheet to invite them into their store. Some good bargains can be found here.There are many famous and traditional Korean restaurant here namely Kyoja, Sinseon Seolleotang, Hadongkwan...However, I didn’t see any bar or pub here."
263,5.0,"Myeongdong has everything from food to shopping. You'll find every possible thing for beauty and skincare routines, through all price ranges. The street food there is amazing.. a mix of sweet and savoury. It is the most lively during evening, around 6-7pm.. and most shops are open till 9 or post 9pm too. It was one of my favourite places in Seoul!"
264,3.0,Lots activties but roads are not even and i had a sprain.Lots of street food to try!Don't feel it is an ideal place for elerly.
265,5.0,"I love this market the most. I’ve been to all recommended markets but Myeongdong is the best for me. I really enjoy shopping there. There are many cosmetic shops, clothes and also restaurants. In the evening you can find lots of the street food. The price is reasonable too. You can spend a day there!"
266,4.0,Had a taste of fried milk which was nice since I hv never tried that before. Lots of street food and Korean skin care products
267,4.0,"You will find many things what u need here. Beauty store, shoes store, street food and many more. Mostly tourist will come here. Too good walk here. So crowded"
268,2.0,I dislike crowded places so this was one of the places in Seoul I do not want to go back ever again but the proximity of the beauty product shops ranging from Nature Republic to Skin Food and tons of other brands is astounding. I love the Lush Store here.
269,5.0,"This place has a lot more to offer. Food, clothing, beauty products, shoes and etc. you can find here. Its easy also here to exchange money from PHP to KRW with competitive rate. I love the strawberry with chocolate which you can buy in one of stall in the street."

271,5.0,"I enjoyed Myeongdong area because I love eating and shopping. It’s a good place to find stuffs for yourself and your family. From branded items to local brands you can find it here. You can visit huge malls in the area particularly Lotte Department Store/Mall. You can also find souvenirs especially at the Underground shopping center. If you get hungry then it’s not a problem as well because there’s a lot of restaurant, coffee shops, food stalls, and a lot more to choose from. Everyone who’ve been there loves it and I’m sure you will too."
272,3.0,"I have been there many times, so feel like this place is for Koreans who want to see many foreigners. If you want to feel Korean natural vibe, then this place is not for you, even though it is quite fun to visit this market."
273,4.0,"Visited the area over several days and found the area had a lot of choice for both shopping and restaurants. The staff selling face masks at every second shop can be a little daunting as they can be aggressive. They offer free samples but if you don't go into the shop, they take them from you.You can find many beauty product shops here as well as all the international branded chains.In the evening the food stalls come out and these are great and offer a variety of cuisines and all relatively inexpensive."
274,5.0,"You dont go to Seoul without going to Myeongdong and experiencing it. What a dynamic place that is teeming with shoppers, tourists, vendors all seemingly at their most vibrant when in Myeongdong. The prices are reasonable and a whole range of stuff to buy. It is a widely known fact, in Myeongdong, one doesnt just get to bring home all the cosmetic goodies that one buys. You get loads of freebies as well."
275,5.0,"Variety of street food (corn, spicy rice cake, fruit, etc.).  Great place to buy socks, makeup, etc.."
276,5.0,"If you are a boy or girl that loves food and all things beauty, then what are you waiting for! This place is a must! I spent a whole day here and also put a bit of dent in my wallet but it was well worth it! There are many of the same shops just down the street from another but that doesn't bother me. This place is a MUST! and just typing this gives me post Myeongdong depression. I will definitely be back!"
277,5.0,"If you love SHOPPING, then this is the place for you. Indeed, Myeondong Shopping District is heaven for those who loves to shop. You can find anything and everything here. From shoes, clothes, K-Pop K-Star memorabilia and of course BEAUTY Products. Cosmetics Power Houses such as Face Shop, Etude and all over the place. Tip, if you find yourself falling in love with the prices offered in one Face Shop, hold yourself first and walk further, look for other Face Shops they might offer cheaper prices of their face masks and make-up. Same shop but offers different prices. What I love about this district is they offer plenty of samples for free to shoppers inside the shops and even on the street. This place is crowded but safe and clean. If you are a tourist, don't forget to bring your passports with you. The shops here offers discount to foreigners just present your passport."
278,5.0,"From Kpop, Kdrama and of course the K Beauty products are all daunting in Myeongdong. A lot of sale offers in different stores that can result to hauling. Also try out the variety of street foods espescially the beefsteak."
279,5.0,"We came around 11am Sunday morning , it's not crowded , two tourist information people dress in red to help you and guide you where you want to go which was very helpful of them and save my time looking for the shops like Aland, adidas, olive young,artbox ,Myeongdong kyoja noodle for lunch . Spend almost the entire day here which was worth it . So many boutiques, cafes , cosmetics stores etc . Didn't try the street food here though as I realized the price at the higher range ."
280,5.0,"This shopping district is full of shops and vendors. I found there is a huge emphasis on beauty and makeup products but also clothing. The street food is amazing - definitely try the pastry fish filled with custard or Nutella! If you prefer a really busy, crowded area I recommend going to this area after 3PM as that is when it really picks up. If you prefer less people, go before 3PM but the street food vendors usually aren't there until after 3PM when it gets much busier."
281,5.0,"It is very bustling at night with so many people, a lot tourists. Street food is good but need more variety I think. Shopping is a must-do and there is sale everywhere. Beauty products are a must-buy."
282,5.0,It’s always lively throughout the day but the real fun starts at night with Street food and crazy shopping at every corner
283,5.0,We spent wayyyy yo much time here. It's a busy area with lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. I do find that some prices (mostly clothing) are slightly higher than other non-touristy areas. Lots of street food and restaurants too. It opens till 10pm. Definitely a good spot to hang out at night after visiting all the palaces during the day. Be ready to receive free masks/samples ;)
284,5.0,Good chance to see and taste the local way of life with many outdoor entrepreneurs with local foods and goods
285,5.0,"If you’re not careful, you could break the bank on your first day. Myeongdong deserves at least 5 days of exploration if you are into shopping. The quality of the Korean clothing brand are awesome. You will need to do a lot of research with the skin care and cosmetics, though. Otherwise, you’ll end up buying everything you see. There are lots of restaurants to choose from or you can opt for street food. We were hungry all the time, so everything tasted awesome to us."
286,4.0,Myeong-dong shopping street is the place to go for everything you may want especially in brand clothing. This is a very modern area of Seoul and not where you would typically go to see a traditional street market. The fashion can be a bit on the higher end but a definite place to go to shop for clothes.
287,5.0,"Korean is known for beauty products and fashion, when it comes to clothing. I like their style, a European and American inspired clothes. Their taste of clothes quite similar maybe because they have the same 4 seasons in a year. There's a variety of clothes to choose on, can bargain as well but don't ask to low. Don't forget to make an spectacles for yourself also, coz they do it very fast and a variety of choices for frames for their fashion taste. Give yourself a try!😉"

I would say in the late afternoon 4pm onwards the street vendors come out in droves and everything is delicious. Highly recommend the chicken and leek skewer, the fish shaped pastry stuffed with red beans(very sweet) and the grilled cheese with rice cakes. This street has many small bars and cafes on it as well as loads of shopping. Ladies this is the place to go for skin care, there are many stores dedicated to skin care here. Fun tip, they will give you a free face mask if you walk around the store for about 2 min. with no obligation to buy! You can not bargin on food prices here but can bargin on goods. Excellent way to spend the early evening."

You should try the street food its really good (maybe due to winter weather, i got hungry very often😹) Slightly expensive since it touristy area."

As the evening progresses so as the number of shoppers grew to astronomic proportions. It is a place to enjoy and satisty one’s craving for traditional food and shopping. You can see from the faces of the crowd the enthusiasm and eagerness to find the best piece of item they are looking for. My friends and I arrived in that famous street one cold evening this February just in time to join the frenzy and excitement of the different nationalities of people walking and bargaining for the best available price all around the place. It was exhausting but definitely exciting.
