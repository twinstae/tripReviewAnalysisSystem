0,5.0,"Nice overview of Korean history. Lovely exhibits and objects to view. Highly interactive - including one exhibit about Korean astronomy and star mapping - including star magnitudes. Of course there was a bit of Korean dream analysis, too. Very interesting."
1,5.0,"Fun fact: This museum is built in modern days. Although for ordinary people, this museum may blend in with Gyongbuk Palace. But for historians, the style of this building do not follow traits of traditional Korean palaces. Rather, it is more of a Buddhism-style building. There's a long debate in Korea on rebuilding and relocating the museum."
2,5.0,Check this place out preferably on a warm day when its not raining.  A lot of walking and out door things but again someplace that is must see in Korea.
3,4.0,"If you're visiting the Palace, go see the museum as well. It's walking distance and within the palace grounds.  Shows cultural and historical pieces. Does not take a long time to explore the place - and on a hot day, they have good air conditioning, clean bathrooms and the cafe at the lobby/entrance offer a variety of hot and cold beverages."

9,3.0,This is a sweet little museum. It's clean and of a good quality. The exhibitions are just a bit ordinary. It seems like much of the history of Korea has been lost. This is on the same site as theGyeongbokgung Palace.
10,4.0,"Situated next to the Gyeongbok Palace, it is another place to consider spending some time to visit to understand the history and culture of the country."
11,4.0,"This is a good museum to understand about History of Korean People.  Here we can see the culture of Korean people since long time ago.

This is very good museum."

Great overview of history and culture - perfect background for new business ventures and the information provided for great dinner conversation with our hosts the following day.
22,3.0,"This museum was an interesting museum and I tend to like Folk museums but much of the museum was taken up by a special exhibit on Blue Jeans which I did not care for. Regular exhibits were interesting but the Royal palace Museum is better.Has a cafe, bathrooms and other facilities which are nice and clean."

The area are separated by rooms, u'll travel from room to room with a different stories."
