0,5.0,You may access to most the popular attractions with their seoul metro. They are cheap and fast .  Clear English signage and easy to understand how to transfer one subway to another.
1,4.0,Looks complicated at first especially when we need to change a few lines to get to our station but using the naver map makes it easier for us to check train timings and the best way to get to our destination. Train cabin is usually clean and comfortable. Not all exit has a lift/escalator or sometimes there are stairs leading to the platform so you may need to carry your luggage up and down the steps.
2,5.0,I loved how reliable the public transportation system was in Korea - every train station has a number!
3,5.0,"The Subway in Korea at first glance can be overwhelming. But once you find the right way of using it, it becomes a cheap and fast way of getting around Seoul. The trains are very frequent, om time and extremely clean, like everything else in this fantastic city. As long as you know which exit to use, that's the main thing that can be tricky because every underground station also has a multitude of shops. I suggest using the  KakaoMetro App, along with a good map and some good old common sense."
4,5.0,"Efficient transport system that is real easy to navigate. Do consider the timing - if you’re taking a late train, check whether it’ll bring you to your destination or they may just stop halfway and you’ll be stranded and forced to take a taxi. Buses may be a better option if you’re taking a train around 11pm."
5,5.0,"Have used the metro extensively over the last two weeks,  so well signposted and set up that we have not gone wrong once. Superb value dor money too, this puts the UK to shame!Get the Subway app, it is exceptionally good for planning your trip with live information and timetables. Never before have I enjoyed using a subway."
6,3.0,Don't use at peak time 6-8am and 6-9pm . You will know how to be stuck in a box over load people . But impressed with Seoul citizens the way they follow the social behavior
7,5.0,It was so cool honestly all i need to do is learn hangul and ill be a pro...but it is so cheap and so easy to use...but you have to be fast pace you dont want to miss your train.
8,4.0,Timely accurate and fast to get you where you're going. Sometimes that journy can take a significant amount of time as the city is so large.
9,5.0,One of the best MRT networks in the world. Trains are constant and clean. Some stations are located pretty far away from train platforms so be weary of that.
10,5.0,"Seoul has a good subway system.  It does what a subway is intended to do: it gets you where you are going.  For the eight days that I visited Seoul I had frequent occasion to use this transportation service. If you look at the subway map, you will see how it crisscrosses the city, with the various crisscrossing lines.  This means with a transfer or two you can go from any part of the city covered by the subway to any other part.The trains are quiet and clean. There are seats reserved for the elderly and the infirm, and seats reserved for pregnant women.Regretfully, there is at least one fly in the ointment, and that is the paucity of escalators at some stations.  At those stations there is often a steep and long climb by stair."
11,4.0,"This subway system is extensive and cheap. It took a couple of days to figure it out but once you do it's really easy to use and can get you anywhere you need to go, including the airport. The biggest obstacle is the sheer number of stations and lines available. Also, if you buy single trip cards, you must return them to an automated machine to get your deposit back each and every time.  If I had to do it over again I'd just get the reloadable card. Avoid rush hours as the trains are also EXTREMELY full and personal space is non-existent as with a lot of other subway systems in Asia during peak hours."
12,5.0,Just get a prepaid ticket from most convenience stores and you are on your way. Can get tight in rush hour and stops at midnight.
13,5.0,Superb network of trains with 9 lines differentiated in 9 colour codes. The trains are very clean. Many passers by also helped in purchasing the ticket.
14,4.0,I am always considering the Metro a good way to visit a city. You can see the people and the quality of life of the city.Seoul Metro give me the same feeling.
15,5.0,"Amazing compared to any system in the worldThe metro is cheap and efficient, the only downside is that it stops running at midnight"
16,5.0,The Seoul metro is very convenient. I purchased a card at a convenience store and had it loaded. I find the Seoul metro diagram fairly easy to read. Using the card is simple and can be easily reloaded from a vending type machine.
17,5.0,Super convenient and very fast paced to get anywhere. All lines are connected so it makes it very easy to transfer between lines to get to any stop to almost any part of town
18,5.0,The good thing about metro is they hardly get late. The metro is always on time and that's one of the praiseworthy issues. The stations are clean with the availability of basic amenities.
19,4.0,Visiting South Korea for work and stayed about an hour from Seoul. The public transport system was a great way to get around and relatively easy to understand. Convenient to move in and around the city and cheap fares. Make sure you get a T money card to tap on/off.
20,5.0,"Just on time and a lot of lines. Great option to meet the city. Use KakaoMetro as app to move, plan your trip and know how much is the ticket."
21,5.0,The metro are clean and safe. At the rush hour the trains are very full.  Especially Line 2 (green line)
22,5.0,All you need is a t-money card and Naver maps app in your phone. So easy to get around.The exits are numbered but it really helps to know where you're going before you hop on.
23,5.0,"Great and well-connected metro...easy to use by any traveller. Clean, reliable, and efficient, highly reccomended"
24,5.0,It's easy to understand. But the first time i.ve lost cause i didnt understand well the system. Once you get the system it will be easy
25,5.0,Such a good service - just load up your T-money card and away you go.So clean and reliable.  Easy to work out the lines to be on too.
26,4.0,"We did not take the T money card, It costs 2500 KRWs and in non refundable. We took about 10 rides @ 1350KRW per ride. they ask you for 500 KRW deposit which is paid back when you end the ride at the machine, like 30 seconds more it takes to get back money.Clean metros, 90% folks on the train on smart phones :) welcome to Samsung Land."
27,5.0,"Buy a card because you will be using this mode of transportation every day and it is worth your time to be prepared instead of buying a ticket every time you go somewhere. It is clean, safe and relatively easy to figure out. I wish we had this mode of transportation in the USA where I live."
28,4.0,"Clean, easy to navigate and fast too. You can use just this mode of transportation to get to any place in Seoul. Avoid old people when walking though, some may bump into you on purpose."
29,5.0,"The Seoul subway is a cheap, fast, and easy way to travel around Seoul. The stations are clean and feel safe (we are two women). The hardest part for us was finding the subway stations we wanted. When you buy your ticket, you pay a 500 won deposit and when you exit, you quickly stick your card in a refund machine and a 500 won coin pops out. Very efficient!"
30,5.0,Traffic is generally terrible in Seoul so the Metro a relatively cheap and easy way to get around covering most of the city. You can buy single trip tickets which you can reload and when you are finished with them you can redeem your card deposit 1500Won (about £1). The trains are very clean and fellow passengers very courteous. Be careful not to sit in the seats reserved for pregnant travellers (marked in pink) or the seats reserved for elderly travellers...you will get disapproving looks.
31,5.0,Very organised and toilets are super clean! Has a large underground shopping centre and thats where u can find Lotte mart and departmental store too
32,5.0,"Some stations may be a bit difficult to navigate at first, but there are signs everywhere. The fair is 1250 won, so about 10 SEK.Tip: there are restrooms on every station, which are always clean!"
33,5.0,"Use this service.  It is extensive, 100% on schedule, easy, cheap.  If you miss out onanything or got loss, the people of Seoul are friendly and helpful, even those who do not speak English.  Some even walk us through to the right route."
34,5.0,"Not really an activity but I would say this is the easiest way to get around in Seoul. Once you know where to get the T-Money card (at a convenience store) it is super easy to get around. There are signs in English everywhere (although learning Hangeul is always convenient). Be aware that changing from one line to another requires a lot of walking. Make sure to get a good app like Kakao Metro, it really helps a lot."
35,5.0,Easy to get around Seoul.  All machines are English and if you are not sure I am sure someone will stop to help.  One of the cleanest subways I have been on.
36,5.0,"It is a rather vast network of underground rails! However, it is quite friendly with the tourists, as it provides translation in English, Korean and Chinese!"
37,5.0,The Seoul metro is easy to use. You have to buy a refillable card to get around because it does not make sense to have single journey tickets. You can only refill the card with cash not credit card. The arex (airport express train) is reasonably priced and you can use it to the city instead of the all stop train. I enjoyed the AREX with the extra I spent. The all stop train feels forever.
38,3.0,"Seoul train is not comfort enough than mrt (singapore), but its still ok. The problem is ... a few alphabet signage :p lol... if you go to seoul , you must learn about train route first.."
39,4.0,"We found that riding the buses was easier than the subways as we could keep our maps open to make sure we were going the right direction. However, we got on the wrong subway quite a few times because some of the stations do not have signs of the direction the subway is going in, and maps don't work underground. One time we asked a young adult and he nodded that we were going the right direction, but we hopped on only to realize, it was going the opposite direction!"
40,4.0,"If you use the metro/subway to move around in Seoul, you MUST download the apps which is very useful cos can use it offline. Best! Make sure to buy the T money card. If you buy the ticket, its a hassle to always having to get a refund 500₩ at the machine. Moreover, theres a discount of 100₩ if you use the T money card. A minimium fare of 1250₩ (discounted) is charged and additional fare 100₩ or more is charged depending on distance travelled."
41,5.0,"Very accessible except for loys of stairs, but a great way to get around the cityWe were able to navigate easily on our iwn"
42,5.0,"Compare to Japan subway system, Seoul metro is very easy to follow. Just know where you're going, which line you're taking and familiarize your exit. We stayed close to Seoul Station, which is the transportation hub of Seoul. Google maps doesn't work well in Seoul, but I used ""rome2rio"" for trip planning. There's also free apps for Seoul metro that we've tried using but after 3 days, we got comfortable and confident without using any help. The only bad experience we had using their metro was the airport limo bus drivers. They were not being helpful, very impatient when we did not understand them. I mean these drivers are dealing with tourists all the time, they should have some basic English knowledge or at least have some friendly dispositions, towards guests. Other than this disappointing experience, taking the metro is the cheapest way to get around Seoul."
43,5.0,"A ride is about 1,250 KRW. Pretty easy to navigate and topping up is simple. Make sure to download the latest subway map as new stations are always added."
44,5.0,"The best way to travel round Seoul is to use the metro. It is easy to navigate, runs like clockwork, is clean, safe and can get you anywhere without being stuck in traffic."
45,4.0,"From Canada and found the metro easy to use, signage in English,  just make sure you know your start and stop stations, easy to get ticket machines have English just need to select.   Enjoy the metro"
46,5.0,The fastest way to travel from one tourist spot to another within Seoul with very low cost. Avoid the peak time and the ride brings pleasure.
47,3.0,"When we visited Seoul we tried to  use the metro, it was no good experience, it was difficult to use the ticket machine and no one around to help, moreover, the tickets that we cut did not open the gate for us, we looked around the station to find a staff to help us we couldn't find till we reached their office at the end of the station."
48,5.0,"I love the subway system in Seoul.  With a subway map and some money, you can get anywhere.  It is clean and feels so safe compared to NYC.  This is my main mode of transportation when I’m in Seoul"
49,5.0,"The metro is easy to navigate, very safe, and clean. It takes a little time but you don't have to worry about traffic or finding parking. Plus you get the bonuses of a core workout if you have to stand and people watching!"
50,5.0,"First time for me to ride a Metro in Seoul and I was amazed by the cleanliness and well organized system. I am not an adventure person although I love to travel... and for me to take a metro with my friend took a lot of courage.  But to my surprise, metro in Seoul has English transitions everywhere and super easy to ride. Only tricky part is getting the ticket at the machine but once you read it carefully and figure out how it works, it is the best way to travel. I recommend to avoid rush hours as it can get crowded and remember to keep the ticket till you get out as you need to exit but also to retrieve your refund. 😎"
51,5.0,The next section asks when did you travel. I have to supply a month! I use it all the time in Seoul. The best and cheapest subway system I have used in the world. Efficient - most lines a train every five minutes or so. Clean. By far the best way to travel around Seoul
52,5.0,Easiest way to travel . Clean and every route labeled in english. Took express train from airport to Seoul station and easily used metro map to arrive at every location
53,5.0,"It definitely made our trip to Seoul much easier and cheaper. It was easy to get to our hotel from the airport in the Metro also. And from there, only you learn how to read the lines and connections it is very easy. And it runs almost every 5 minutes. Just try to avoid going before 9am, as it is super crowded."
54,5.0,You can go everywhere in Seoul by metro and it always will take less time than going by car.The metro is in good conditions and easy to understand.There is an app to check the stations and the transfers that you need to do.
55,5.0,"I mainly stayed in Seoul and traveled using the subway. It connects most of the areas in and near Seoul.To be honest, I loved using the subway system more than the bus."
56,5.0,Korea has one of the best subway system in the world at the really cheap price only problem is the they don't service from midnight to 4am.
57,5.0,"Clean, very well organized, efficient and affordable. Stop information is given in 4 languages. Plenty of clean restroom facilities."
58,5.0,"Love their trains! Always on time, spacious cabins and the routes are easy to negotiate even for a first timer."
59,5.0,"Nothing much to say, it's a really good metro system, clean and on time. I find it really clear and easy to use (compares to others such as Tokyo). I recommend you buy a T-money card and charge it to have a really eas experience"
60,5.0,"I liked it!! It was very nice, not too crowded as I expected, it make a characteristic sound when the train approached ha ha was funny, some train stations have restroom 👌👌"
61,5.0,Great way to get around the city. Signs are in English and so are the announcements so you'll know where you're going. The trains are also really clean
62,4.0,"The subway system in Korea is efficient. It is easy to understand the whole system with lines and exits. We survived just by using a map. We used Tmoney when taking the subs, it was a much easier choice for us. You can actually use the Tmoney card to pay when you shop in any convenience store (if you have money in your card, of course). I did not appreciate how the locals there push others as getting in the train.. and forcing themselves to get into the train..if the train coach is too packed, meaning there’s no more room, stop pushing others just so you can get in. I’ve encountered this situation too many times. The train is clean, however there’s a funky smell in the train.. im not sure what smell it is, sometimes it’s there.. and sometimes it gets stronger. Some stations do not provide elevators , so it is kind of a challenge for those who travel with huge luggage. Overall , I love how efficient and clean the seoul metro is."
63,5.0,"This was one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever had on public transportation! Riders qued both inside and outside the train so that getting on and off was efficient and orderly. Many of the stops on the maps inside the train we rode had the stop name in English which was helpful. Nonetheless, there were several passengers who helped us understand where to go as well. The website is also quite user-friendly. I advise giving yourself an extra 30 minutes to get to your destination in peak times."
64,4.0,"It's easy access, fast, comfortable and convenient. There's a public transportation card exclusively for international visitors, MPASS can be used to take up to 20 city bus and subway rides in April and the surrounding areas."
65,5.0,The best exercise place is the walking in the metro and now I know why Korean girls legs are so slim.
66,4.0,"Easy to use, clean, safe and fast.Cards sometimes dont work but you can use the special gate in that case.Difficult for tourists to find the right exit."
67,5.0,"The Seoul Metro has a very distinct and recognizable chime when trains pull in to the stations. That, coupled with the station name announcements on the trains, will stick in your head for days after you've left the country. Guaranteed!"
68,5.0,"System can take you everywhere you need to go, it is clean and easy to figure out. All the maps and signs are in Korean and English"
69,1.0,"They do not provide AC or cooler temperatures like the subways in HK and Taiwan does. People push you very hard during rush hour trains and your stuck with nowhere to go. I had a panick attack while being pushed in the train and having pretty much no space and air to breathe... I honestly felt I was going to suffocate to death, I very much dislike Seoul Metro and decided after that to take Taxi whereever I go. Never taking Seoul Metro again!!!"
70,5.0,"Just input station where you want to go to. (Use google maps or Rome2Rio for directions.) then machine will ask for how many person then after which card, change and receipt will be printed. The latter, if requested.😊"
71,5.0,"Want to make the most of your trip in Seoul, learn the Metro. Visitors can pick up a special foreigners T-card at the airport on arrival. It costs 4000 won (about $4) and you can load it there. This will allow you to travel on the Metro as well as buses and some cabs. The service is super fast in terms of travel time and we never had to wait more then 10 minutes for the next train to arrive. The stations are super clean but can get a bit confusing. Be sure to look at the top of the entrance door, you will see the name of the previous station, your station and the next station with a small arrow telling you the direction. Each trip we took was under 2000 won per person so totally worth it. You have to scan going in and going out, be sure to do that so you don't get charge for a full trip to the end of the line. Most stations do have elevators, but not really easy to find so be prepared for a lot of steps to use."
72,5.0,Runs on time is spacious has air con is big is clean... what else do you want. In fact I want it in London! Shame on the London tube!!!!!!!!
73,4.0,"Firstly, get the T-money card from any of the convenience shop/ airport and top up. You can easily top up at the machine at every station, just change the language to English. It is easy to do the top up. Don't try to figure out the fares, only you will not get through the gate if there is not enough credit. Don't panic, just press the help button at the gate. Someone will come out to help."
74,4.0,Seoul metro is exceptionaly good. In my experiance the metros are on time  there are 2 types normal and express the normal metro stops at all stops the express at main stops. The cars are clean and comfortable but can get very busy during rush hours. Geting tickets is very easy with the machines in the station. Best way to travel around Seoul.
75,4.0,"Study a map to see where you need to go and even if you cannot read Korean there are some clues that you should look for.Each line has a different colour and line number.  Each station has a number so when you are going from one stop to another look for the station numbers they are located on the station signs and also on the sliding door so that you can see them when standing in the train before the doors open.When transiting from one line to another, look for the transit signs to the various colour lines and there are also brass plaques in the floor pointing the way,It is advisabe to take a photo of the station name so that you can show locals if you need directions back to that location and t is helpful to look at an App to see which exit you need to use. These are all numbered and easy to locate form the signs in the stations or underground tunnels."
76,4.0,"It is one of the best way to get around Seoul city. There are chances where you might be confused with certain stations for tourists, especially if you are a foreigner. We had to get that single entry cad where you hace to make a 500 won deposit on top of tri[ fare but you could get the deposit back once you come out from the station"
77,4.0,Navigating through Seoul is easy with the color coded train lines and buying tickets was also super easy via the machines that sell tickets in multiple languages.
78,4.0,South Korea have a very reliable subway system.You can use the subway to many tourist destinations.Some of the subway stations are connected to underground shopping area and this is a plus points.
79,5.0,"Being a tourist, metro station is giving us a hard time because we need to be familiarize every one of it. But Seoul Metro give us the easiest and fastest way to be in our next target place."
80,5.0,"The Seoul metro has introduced the Seoul airport  railroad from Incheon airport to Seoul station. Unlike the airport express train, it stops on all station. If you are not in a hurry, this  is a cheaper way to reach the city centre. It is Won 4500 per person and the journey takes an hour. The express train is Won 8500 per person and takes 43 minutes. The Seoul metro is well developed with an extensive web of lines that cover most of the tourists spots. The numbering system for each destination helps a lot for tourists like me who do not know the Korean language. It will be more user friendly if the metro has more elevators and escalators to facitate the senior travelers."
81,3.0,Seoul metro is very easy to use even for first timers. The maps are laid out and everything is in english too. Only downside is rush hour is INSANE and Seoul is so large it takes forever to get across the city.
82,4.0,"Be sure to get your T-money when you arrive at the airport to use at metro stations and convenient stores. The vending machines at stations are plenty (with English option). The network is huge and easy (like all other subways). English signages are everywhere, you just have to be alert. There’re many many steps and stairs to go up and down during transfers, sometimes it was difficult to find where the escalators or elevators were."
83,5.0,"A wonderful transport system. Although most of it is in Korean, there is enough in English to make journeys manageable. There are lots of different lines, named by number and colour. Travel is so cheap. Trains run regularly and on time. I travelled with an elderly person and there is disabled access and lifts at all stations we visited. Most people wait in the marked queues and get on board in an orderly fashion.One warning, beware of older Koreans. They are incredibly rude, will push in, push people over and elbow their way through. Other Koreans say nothing because they must respect their elders. Twice the 82 year old I was with was pushed over by them!"
84,5.0,"I rode both around the city and to the airport. The system is easy to use and very reasonable priced. There are stops close to pretty much anywhere. Announcements in Korean, English and Japanese"
85,5.0,"Disclaimer: We did learn to read hangul(the Korean alphabet) before coming and I think that helped. I can't quite remember,  but it's possible that some important signage didn't have English translation. The metro was relatively easy to figure out... as long as you knew where you wanted to end up. We got ourselves tmoney cards and a portable wifi ($6 a day) which meant we could always Google a route and it would tell us which train or bus we needed to take and which exit to use. It only took a day or two to become comfortable getting around this way."
86,5.0,Easy to navigate and goes almost anywhere you need. The price is great as well. Everything is so new and technological. The map is easy to read and even transfers are great.
87,5.0,"I and my bestfriend met in Seoul after my solo trip in Busan. The train system in Korea is really reliable and helpful. Imagine travelling alone and you just read official site and signages. Though you ask the locals for details, it is only for  confirmation. I have uploaded the basic things you need when travelling via train whether it by SRT (second fastest train) or the subway."
88,2.0,So it's take some time before you can understand it. And the system with returning system of you ticket???? And so few ticket machine on the station and a lot of people. Hard to find the station on the machine. Have experience a lot better metro system.
89,4.0,"the running of metro system is well done, efficient, clean and not noisy.  Though the stations signs and announcements are in both korean and english languages, somehow the announcements in english is incomplete hence slight confusion caused. Overall experience is still good."
90,5.0,Seoul metro is very clean and easy to use. The trains come very often and everything is well sign posted.
91,4.0,"Very convenient, a nice change to European standards. Always on time and can take u literally anywhere in Korea!NICE!"
92,5.0,Easy to use and navigate. Stations and trains are clean and trains run very frequently. Easy to transfer and buy tickets.
93,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is really easy to get around.  All the stations have English; the Korean people will be more than willing to help you find your way.  Even if the person you ask doesn't speak English, s/he will find someone who does.  ENJOY GETTING AROUND IN SEOUL"
94,5.0,You can pretty much get anywhere from anywhere and it is fairly inexpensive. You need to buy a transit card but you can get them for relatively inexpensive. Gets very busy during rush hour but the rest of the day this is calm. Closes at midnight!
95,5.0,You will not get lost. Very efficient subway system. I cannot imagine the planning and construction done on this. You can transfer from one line to another. Very convenient.
96,4.0,"Seoul Metro is the fastest and easiest way to get around Seoul. Trains are on time, clean and modern!"
97,4.0,Easy to use. English also included in both signs and onboard announcement. Fast and ontime arrival and departure. Wifi available.
98,5.0,"The best subway system I've experienced. Clean, fast, and essential for any trip to Seoul! Get a T-Money card, one per person, and enjoy the ride."
99,5.0,"Most easy and convenient to go around Seoul. There are many lines, but easy to understand and most are interchangeable. You just need t-money and you can tap tap."
100,5.0,If you compare to any other city in Europe or USA. Subway here is clean clean clean and very safe and convenient.
101,5.0,so fast and convenient! at first it was kinda confusing we often doubt ourselves if we took the right bus (they call the train bus according to our itx ticket).. it's a dream transpo for my country
102,3.0,"Avoid peak hours for taxi, the jam is so so bad that u are wasting time! Take the metro during peak hours - best way"
103,5.0,"Staff service standard is Vert high . Provide correct information to traveler.alway smile ,nice uniform"
104,5.0,"Get a T-Money Card at 7-Eleven or G25 store and experience traveling Seoul on the Metro for jus a few dollars. It takes you everywhere within the city conveniently. Just try to avoid rush hours. It will get crowded if you’re claustrophobic. Overall, the best way to travel in Seoul on a cheap budget."
105,4.0,I have used this system often and the only drawback is the time it take to get from place to place. They have recently changed things so you cannot travel directly to the airport from other regions in Korea. I believe this is a huge mistake on their part and am now more inclined to take the bus (it will drop me directly at the terminal) versus having to take 3 trains just to get to the terminal. This would really be a challenge if I had bags or small children.
106,5.0,"We decided to take a tour of Seoul and use the metro. Very easy to navigate, extremely cost effective. Everyone is willing to help and give advice, it can be a little intimating being in such a large city. But you don't' want to drive or take a taxi in Seoul. Just ask the concierges for help before leaving the hotel and you'll be good. The metro stops are everywhere."
107,5.0,A choice form of transport that brings you to most places a tourist would need including shopping areas and night markets. Affordable as well
108,5.0,"Just wanna share to all foreigners visiting who cant understand korean lang pls do not top up value using 50,000won note for amount selection less than 10,000won. I did that and got my 50,000won stuck in the machine n have to get korean stranger to help me speak to the helpdesk."
109,5.0,Seoul is well connected with the Metro At first I thought it won’t be possible to travel with the metro following the Korean instructions but then I learned the trick of buying the tickets then it was the best option to travel ANYWHERE in Seoul ManalOman
110,5.0,Seoul is so huge that  in order to relocate you will have to use Seoul metro. It is so convenient as there's an application you can/have to download from Play market and viola you know exactly how to use this huge net of metro. The net is so wide that metro stations exit number varies  between 6 to 25. But the best part is that no matter how complicated it may look it has signs and directions in English everywhere and also people are so friendly that they will render their help whenever you need it
111,5.0,"Fast, cheap, efficient and safe - plus it goes literally everywhere! What else could you want from a public transit system?"
112,5.0,"Seoul Metro have several lines but quite easy to understand, even for a first timer.It's very convinience."
113,4.0,"The metro is efficient and well linked. And for someone who does not understand korean- no worries, as there are english and chinese words around that can guide you around. N it makes travelling easy too. Only downsides are the lack of escalators and as i was recovering from a leg injury, so it was quite tough for me."
114,5.0,"The Seoul metro is awesome. I stayed for 5 weeks in 2016 and I have never experienced a better one. Maybe Tokyo is up there too. It is silent, spacious and punctual. The tunes that plays before the trains arrive are really charming and very Korea :)"
115,5.0,"The basic is easy to use. Metro connects to all the famous tourist destinations in Seoul, in addition to metro, you should also combine the bus as well as cheap and convenient."
116,5.0,The most convenient mode of transport to get around in Seoul. A good option for tourists as it is easy to use & connects you to all the Tourist areas in Seoul. Fares start from around 1250KRW a trip if you use the T-Money card.
117,5.0,"It has improved alot since my last trip in 2010 to Korea. The subways are much cleaner, the announcements and signs are in English. Really the best way to get around the seoul metropolitan area and quickest"
118,5.0,"Super clean metro, convenient, all the cars always on time, loved taking it around and also very easy to understand which is key when you are a foreigner and don't speak the language"
119,4.0,depends on the line but sometimes it gets crowded and some transfer stations  have very very long walks and tons of stairs. but overall it is a good cheap way to travel. would give 5 stars if it didnt stop so early...
120,3.0,"Some trains are good and quieter but others are noisy.Stations are not great places ... even though they are tidy but very drab looking.Signs, especially in English, need much improvement.... have to strain to look which station we are in, when in the train."
121,5.0,Once you work out where you need to go the subway becomes an easy inexpensive way to move around Seoul and cities beyond. The numbers and colour coding are extremely easy to follow and the Korean Subway app is a useful addition. A few of the stations have markets in them too...worth a look. Topping up your travel card is simple....machines at every station with different language options available.  This is a fast efficient and comfortable way to travel
122,3.0,Very extensive system. Can get you anywhere but is not the most user friendly system for tourists or non-locals.
123,5.0,"Seoul metro is one of the most clean, quiet and fast metros I have ever used. You can get a single ride ticket to any place in Seoul, then get off and receive a reimburse of $500 won when you use the refund machine, or you can buy a card, charge it and recharge it as much as you want.The wagons are big, always clean, people is into their own business, stops are clear and in English and Korean, maps are everywhere so you can’t get lost that easily.Excellent way of transportation for tourists and locals."
124,5.0,"It is clean, safe and convenient. It runs even after midnight with same price! How wonderful Metro system is~!!"
125,4.0,"Just like London, constructing a metro network in a city with hundred years of history is a very difficult task!  When I first looked at the metro map, I gave up.  However, if you got a metro map with Korean, your own language and the station number, you can go everywhere within Seoul."
126,5.0,"The trains were very clean and it really helps if you want to travel to different places in one day. The trains were also really cheap compared to where I am from and the best thing is that it doesn't really cost extra to change lines! But the seats were pretty hard so if you need to take a long trip and decide to sit for the whole train ride just be sure to get ready (although it wasn't that bad).  Yes, the routes are confusing but during my whole trip I used the app ""Kakao Metro"" which literally saved my life."
127,5.0,"The metro subways and buses are so easy to use. Everything is color coded and they come like every 4 minutes so if you miss one no worry another will be by soon. We traveled using this mode for an entire week, i dont even use this back home in Los Angeles. You purchase the tourist prepaid transit card (TMoney) then load money on it. The card can be used for ALL modes of transport and like a credit card at certain stores. You get discount throughout the city when you show the card. It comes with a map to help you get around and a list of the stores where u can use it. The bus and subway are only a couple of bucks roundtrip."
128,5.0,Very convenient way to get around Seoul. Easier to navigate with the NAVER map or the KakaoMetro app. Otherwise would be a little confusing for tourist.
129,5.0,"the Seoul Metro is a marvel of the world, after using the system for more than 10 years, it’s still one of the best, clean, reliable, systems in the world, it can be crowded at time, for the uninitiated, it may take a trip to two to figure out. All signs are in English. Take note that some transfer stations to different lines can mean a long walk, also pay attention to exit numbers, many stations have many exits, some exits are far from another, so try to pinpoint where you going to get off the right exit"
130,3.0,Maybe it wasn't as convenient as hk metro. But is sure also tourist friendly. Also the underground shopping mall is great if you are looking for a good deal in a cheap price.
131,5.0,"My mother and I took a lot of subway in Seoul in our 5 day visit. The subway is really convenient to get around. There are also designated seats for elderly, children and disabled, and I do see young people rather stading than taking those seats. The only down side is that we couldn't always find lift at the station. Some stations have escalator, but only up not down. With my mother's bad knee it was really not great. If you don't have stroller or wheelchair it is quite good.Overall, i think it's better than Japan's subway, but worse than Hong Kong's. Still far better than New York subway, which is a dump."
132,4.0,"Easy to navigate, clean and efficient. People are really respectful even in  rush hour. Very quiet and warm seats. Download Subway Korea, i found it very useful."
133,3.0,Need more English signs for directions. A lot of stairs which is typical but inconvenient. Directions are confusing for visitor as well as locals.
134,5.0,"Free wifi, easy to understand communication for stops in multiple languages, app in English to make planning trips easier including transfers"

136,5.0,Well connected routes spread accross the city.. on time.. clean and spacious..The route numbers and colors help a lot for any one who doesn't read Korean
137,4.0,"The seoul metro is probably the most convenience way to travel for tourist whilst in Seoul, you can differentiate the route by the colours. You can buy and top up your card in any convenience store for a multi trip tickets and you can bring back home for souvenir, or you can buy one in the station if you want to buy a single trip ticket."
138,5.0,"Seoul's vast metro network makes traveling around the large megalopolis city easily. In the summer, the tunnels are very hot bit the cars are comfortably air conditioned."
139,5.0,The metro in Seoul is really nice and easy to use it is both in Korean and English. You can buy the tickets outside and the menu is in different languages. You can buy a card to refill with cash ( you can use it to pay taxis and buses) or buy one for a single trip. They charge you a deposit of 500 when you use that card buy as soon as you exit there is a machine to give you your deposit. They charge you depending on your destination if it is less than 10k it is the standard charge but if is more far away the tariff changes.
140,4.0,"Transportation is very easy at Seoul. Just make sure you have your T-Card loaded and download an offline map of their metro. For those who don't have their TCard, there's a vending machine at the Station where you can buy/load.Note:TCard prices vary based on their design...Trains runs in a number of colorful lines (at least 9) but don't get overwhelmed. There's translation of the train's destination on the platform. Once you find which Line/Color you'll be travelling, check both ends of that line so you'll know the train's direction/platform. You can enter any car since there's no separate one for male/female. Special seats are reserved for elderly on each car. If you need to transfer to another Line/Color,don't tap out.Just look for the arrow indicating where to transfer, otherwise, your TCard will be deducted. If you have your luggage/trolly, there's a special gate where you can tap and exit smoothly. Station officers are also very attentive to assist. Seoul subway have at least 6 exits so make sure to check your destination to save time.=)."
141,5.0,"This trip I took more of the Metro System as I have retired and doing more sightseeing. Coming from Singapore where MRT system experience frequent stoppages due to ineffective management, the Seoul Metro was a breeze and great.If only Singapore can learn from experienced folks rather than think it has Military Generals who can be helicopter in to fix the problem. Indeed I think it got worst."
142,5.0,"I really like Seoul metro and subway. They are clean, have easy-to-follow directions and are really tourist friendly. It’s not complicated. People actually respect ways that are put in place that make it organized."
143,3.0,It's very convenient to travel if your hotel is near the station.Very clean.The only disadvantage is there are lots of steps to go up and down.Not all station has lift or escalator.Problem for elderly and people having knee problem.Hope they will look into itCheers!
144,5.0,"easy and comfortable to connect various routes and stations around the city, fair cost of journey and best to connect to Inchon airport."
145,5.0,Right time service... Easy to take for any tourists... We took it with T-money card that can be bought from any convenience stores....
146,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is widely used by both the locals and the tourists. This is because it is an extremely easy, convenient and efficient means of transportation. And it isn't just the train and/or the train's timetable. The infrastructure of the stations also make it easy for handicapped and elderly persons to get around on their own as there are elevators at nearly every station. All the stops are labelled in both English and Hanguk (Korean) so it's easy for us foreigners as well. But just like many major cities, it gets really crowded during peak hours. Operating hours are between 5am and 12am (midnight) though this might change depending on the station."
147,4.0,Cover most route in seoul and dont forget your tmoney for use this transportation.Very crowded on rush hour
148,4.0,I took the metro from itaewon to Gangnam for the first time. It took a bit but I got the hang of all of the transfers and which lines to get on. It was cool new way to travel for me. It got a little crowded at times but I guess that is expected ha.
149,5.0,"It's my third time in Seoul, but it was my first time to ride their subway station. I was really impressed, it's so easy to use. English is widely available on their maps and in every stop they announced the location in Korean, in Chinese and in English. It's one of the cheapest means to go around the city beside the bus of course."
150,5.0,"As someone who came from country that doesn't own subway, Seoul metro is always amaze me everytime I use it.There are lines that connect to each other destination.You can pay with t money and the top up machine are everywhere beside the subway entrance."

152,5.0,"Seoul’s metro system is extensive throughout the greater Seoul metro area. It’s very fast and on time. Take note of the signs (with pictures) that label seats designated for elderly, disabled, and pregnant. Do yourself a favor and buy a reusable card."
153,5.0,Great way to get around Seoul. Just remember most trains stop running around midnight. Helpful and courteous information staff. Easy for foreigners.
154,3.0,"I see the really high scores on other reviews and I wonder what this metro system has tht you can't find in Singapore and Hong Kong (which I find superior). It doesn't come as often, to change lines you have to walk quite a bit and to find one from the city is not that easy."
155,4.0,Easy and most convenient choice to get around in Seoul. Cheap fare and no traffic issues. Subway train comes every ~6mins.
156,4.0,On our first time to take the subway we had difficulty in figuring out where we wanted to go. But become easy after we’ve been using it for the rest of our stay.

158,5.0,A lot of signs are everywhere! You can easily find your way! And it's very cheap! Train comes music is our favorite ;)
159,5.0,First time visit with minimal previous metro experience and we were able to get around.  Just double check your stations and lines to make sure you get on in the right direction.  Very clean.
160,5.0,The train system is easy to figure out and there are information booths everywhere. If you don’t see one just press the red button on the machine and an English speaking employee will go to you. All the stops are close to major destinations no need to walk so far.
161,3.0,"Connecting trains are somewhat far for some stations. Quick and there's announcements for every stop in various language (Korean, Japanese,Chinese and English) but it's not loud so you'll have to strain your ears..."
162,5.0,"Best way to explore Seoul, the metro is connected in all major destination around Seoul. You can download the app Seoul Metro (yellow in Playstore) Blue in Apps store.. Enjoy traveling.."

165,4.0,"If you need to get somewhere at a specific time, it isn't the best, however if you need to get somewhere, the Metro will do just fine. Might be a little tough if you don't speak Korean but it is manageable."
166,4.0,"I prefer taking the cab in Seoul as cabs are cheap, and my friends and i usually split every ride. But the Seoul metro is good if you're travelling alone. I wish they had more things such as station name written and/or announced in English too. You can also do a lot of super affordable shopping around the metro area."
167,5.0,"the Seoul metro is organized and great, but many parts will demand you walk a LOT. Some exits don't have escalators so you'll have to walk up 4 flights of stairs to get to ground exit."
168,5.0,"At least I need to said for my five days in Seoul,Metro is a good friend for me. Only ₩1250 can take my to any where.  if can let English bigger in map and let me quick understand which station should we transfer is more wonderful."

171,5.0,Very close and easy to get around and we asked a lot of questions.. the walk to the main road was easy
172,5.0,"Very clean subway system that is easy to navigate once you get used to it. The trains are incredibly prompt and you'll hear a lovely jingle before your train arrives. The map lights up on board so its really clear which stop is coming up next. The stations are very clean and you'll actively see cleaners wiping down the subways on a daily basis (London could learn a thing or two from this). We're not sure if its permitted or not but we never saw anyone eating or drinking on the subway and we used it a lot, so its something to be way of. The underground stations are HUGE and take 5-10 minutes walking when you're swapping lines, something to think about if you're in a hurry.You have to use the T Money card to use the subway, topping up at stations or convenience stores with cash. Also - absolutely do not sit in the seats designated for the elderly/pregnant (even if they are empty during your trip). This is frowned upon."
173,4.0,"Used the metro to go from the main downtown area of seoul(city hall) to Gangnam and found the train efficient, clean and easy to use. Heating was good during the cold days and the announcements in both English and Korean were appreciated. This metro is also a inexpensive way to move around Seoul."
174,4.0,"The subway system is very easy, affordable, and well connected. It takes time to get used to crowds."
175,3.0,I didn’t go on this trip. I backed away at the last minute. It was so crowded. You have never seen so many people in a wee space. Not for the claustrophobic.
176,4.0,"Although the Seoul Metro is very similar to the HK MTR - IMHO, the Seoul Metro is by far much better.  It is much more affordable, good coverage, and very easy to navigate.  Most importance, the stores in each station are difference and local.  Not like HK where every station has similar services (brand name stores)"
177,5.0,"Total cleanliness, quick, accessible; plus very reasonable prices! What else should public transportation promise?!"
178,5.0,"The subway in Seoul is really well-functioning public transport. I recommend this type of transport to all travelers in Seoul. It is simple, fast, cheap and pleasant👍"

180,5.0,Easy access to all kinds of attractions in Korea. Cheap and affordable mode of transportation. Just be mindful of the seats for elderly and pregnant women must not be used by young visitors
181,5.0,"This is such a well put together system, it makes it so that you never have to take a taxi or bus anywhere."
182,5.0,"I downloaded the Korean subway app & Naver map app , its very useful to direct you which transit ,how many stop and save time . 1st I buy the T money card 💳 , its saves you 100 won each trip from the usual price for adults , teenagers each trip 750 won from the usual 1350 won. Need comfortable walking shoes as some underground station is quite far away and lots of stairs for transit to another line . I even use this metro for airport transfer to gimpo airport which was cheap and on time ."
183,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is brilliantly designed to offer easy access to almost anywhere in the city. We were in Seoul for 8 days and travelled almost exclusively by subway. We got around quickly and easily. The trains run on time, are fast and efficient, and the fare is very reasonable. The stations, the trains and the busses are all very clean. They are not crowded either because there are trains running every 2-3 minutes. I recommend purchasing a T-Money card (available to buy at kiosks in any station) which you load with money and use for subway trains, city busses and even some taxis. The subway stations are easy to navigate with English sub-titles on all of the signage. The train stops are all announced in English as well as Korean and there's plenty of signage and way-finding available in the stations to help you find your way. I 100% recommend taking the Seoul Metro!"
184,4.0,"The seoul metro is the most confusing in the country but once you get the hang of it, it is no problem. All stations and trains are clean and very efficient. A necessity for travelling around the city."
185,4.0,"The train carriages were very spacious we were so impressed and even joked about being able to dance ""in like a dancefloor"" inside. Service was efficient and stations are ""user friendly"". It gets easier going from place to place with time and practice. It's cheaper too. Not all stations have lifts though, so if you're carrying luggages, you'll have to have a bit of a workout."
186,5.0,"The metro system is great as long as I used KakaoMetro app. You enter the starting station and the destination station and you get times, stations on the way, car to ride in and any transfers necessary."
187,4.0,"Vibrant asian metropolis like Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong to name a few, have a lot in common. One of them is an efficient metro rail transportation system. In South Korea, the Seoul Metro runs the whole length and width of the city. And it runs within seconds of a pre-recorded music announcing its arrival in all its stations bringing hundreds of thousand of people during its daily operations. It is quite clean and comfortable and fast. Its amazing to note that in spite of its daily grind to alleviate the lives of the commuting public, hardly a news that trumpet issues in safety can be seen in the local news. The metro is a rapid mass transit that is efficient and contributes immensely to the economy of South Korea. The only hard part is for a foreigner to read and interpret the huge map of its destinations that looks like a maze in itself."
188,5.0,This is ordinary transportation but I was so amused. But the map was pretty confusing tho haha but stilll!! I love it
189,5.0,"Better than Chinese metro, spacious and well staffed. Easy to find, and little security. Nice to have such a well run system"
190,5.0,"One of the best subway, easy to find his directionMany apps well detailled for Seoul subway and in english as well."
191,5.0,"In a country with excellent public transportation all around, the Seoul Metro is second only to the KTX (Korean bullet train).  It's a little over one dollar per one-way ride anywhere in the city, goes pretty much everywhere, and relatively clean.  You can find some older, shabbier trains at times, but for the most part is quick and efficient, with English-language ticket machines if you need them."
192,4.0,"Easy to navigate and work through, the Seoul metro is a hubbub of activities.Some of the main/interchange stations have little shops you could have a little pit stop at.Would certainly recommend you to stay away from the subway at peak times such as 5.30 to 6.30pm. My sister and I had to truly push our way through to get in the trains and when inside, we truly had perspective on what ""no space"" means. If you want a challenge, certainly try going on the trains during these times and see if you could Korean style you way out of these trains at your station."
193,5.0,"One of my favourite metro systems on the planet. Efficient, generally clean, affordable, always evolving, multi language, amazing. It’s the circulatory system of one of the most dense cities on the planet. Hell yes 5 star. I’d give it 6 if I could."
194,5.0,"Organized, fast, clean, cheap and easy access to the main area!I enjoyed taking the metro in Seoul is easier than taxi!"
195,3.0,"The Seoul Metro is a great way to get around Seoul and surrounding area. They have plenty of routes/stops. However, be careful to which routes you need to take as one of the lines (I think it was line 1) has more than one route. They have signs in english for ease of understanding."

199,5.0,"The metro system is clean and nice and wonderfully easy to use. The ticket machines all have an English option and you can just touch the screen to select your destination, no need to worry about spelling or if you spent the right amount. Signs are in English and verbal notices are done in both Korean and English. The Metro is so clean you can even use the bathroom there!!"
200,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is excellent! Clean, wide, punctual, good air conditioner and so safe. I lived 5 months in Seoul and could visit many places around the city thanks to the subway!!!"
201,5.0,"Trains and stations are super clean and easy to use! I use an iphone app (there are several free ones) and wifi on the trains and stations means you can update your location. Used in conjunction with busses, you can get around Seoul cheaply and easily."
202,5.0,"The metros are fast, every 5 minutes there is another one coming. The stations are clean and the metros are punctual. T-money makes it convenient for you to get anywhere you want (transportation is crazy cheap!) and you can access anywhere in Seoul easily."
203,5.0,taking metro is the best and easiest way to travel in seoul. it may be little confusing at first but metro map or application can help. t-money card/cashbee card is a must have. you can buy it from convenience stores or at metro stations. recharging money is very  easy since the machine has english language.
204,5.0,"We've been to a lot of cities, but Seoul's metro is the most comprehensive, connected, clean, and safe. Unlike other cities that use different Subway systems, Seoul is all one company, and your fares work for buses as well. Our only issue with it is the colors, which are quite similar to each other. :)"
205,5.0,An ideal way to commute to attractions in Seoul. Just buy T-money and use it for all stations. Most of the attractions in Seoul is nearby one or two Metro stations
206,4.0,"Be careful to find your way in this big transit station. There are different metro lines, airport rail and train stations. Find your way carefully, read road signs, find your direction and do not get lost. Road signs are in multi-languages. Suggest to buy a T-money card to accelerate the access. 在這個大型轉車站要小心找路，這裏有不同的地鐵線路、機場鐵路和火車站。 仔細找路，閱讀路標，找到方向，不要迷路。 道路標誌是多語言的。 建議購買T-money卡出入閘。"
207,5.0,The most convenient and inexpensive commuting options on the planet. And I have ridden on Japanese rails.
208,5.0,"Very clean and modern metro. convenient and most reliable transportation in the city of seoul. Metro runs every few minutes in every corner of Seoul through center, many different lines of route covers the whole city like spiderweb. Clear announcements on each and every stop. Most effective way to explore Seoul. Fair is cheap."
209,4.0,"Looks complicated initially but when you understand the map, its so easy to go around Seoul by train ☺️☺️☺️I loved that seats were heated because its freezing cold outside! Carts are clean too! Stations were not as chaotic as new york but not as well maintained and clean as japan ☺️Oh and so many shops in the stations, and I’m not sure its a good thing because I tend to spend more time on the stations looking around 😂😂😂"
210,4.0,"The metro in Korea almost cover everywhereIt's easy to find exit, transfer and entrance to many place"
211,5.0,Efficient. Easy to use with their mini map given with the T card. Took some of the rides during peak hours and it’s not a good experience as it was jam packed. Will recommend buying the T card instead of single trips as it’s slightly cheaper.
212,5.0,"The metro system is so much easier to use then I expected, as you just by a t-money card and top it up as you need to. As well as the maps are in both Korean and English, as well as approaching stations on the train, it will be announced in English. The metro is also very clean"
213,4.0,got to say it wasnt hard taking the subway in seoul. although the english language sign are rather small to read but if you pay enough attention you wont get lost.
214,4.0,"The best way to get around Seoul City. The transportation is cheap, easy to access and efficient. The train is clean, the station is clean, and could be the fastest and cheapest way to get around the city since taxi fare is quite expensive and the traffic is heavy. I recommend you to buy electronic payment card that can be toped-up to make your payment easier."
215,5.0,Seoul is very easy to navigate if you take the Metro.  It's organized and affordable if you can handle the stairs
216,5.0,"Cheap, easy, and efficient. Everyone is so polite and the trains are super clean. Definitely the fastest and probably the safest way to get around the city."
217,1.0,"For 1st timer to seoul. Download seoul subway from google play. Easy to move around. Or download seoul subway map also can. Easy to refer. You cant get subway map from station. Due to, too many lines in seoul. Definate you will confuse."
218,5.0,I went to Korea with my friend in September and to be honest we were really scared of Seoul Metro when we were planning our trip. At first we felt like Alice in Wonderland but it's not that complicated as it looks. 'Korea tour - offline maps' app was very helpful. Of cousre it was extremely crowded sometimes but we were counting with that. The underground shopping centers are awesome!!! Plus they have soo cute metro cards~~
219,3.0,Best way to go around the city (if required only!)  It is very clean but you have to listen carefully for stops as the sound system is a bit faint
220,5.0,"Compared to the one in France, its so clean and high tech! Wifi everywhere in the metro! It's also super easy to navigate and if you don't understand, koreans will gladly help you :)"
221,5.0,"Yes the seoul metro can be intimitating and complicated for some. All you need is to google the place you are visiting and the nearest metro station. The next tool you need is the KakaoMetro-Subway Navigation. It tells you how to get to the other subway station and also where to transfer. It also provide you with an estimate of timing. Also for transfer like an interchange station, you do not need to exit thru the gantry. There is usually a passage way or linkway for you to transfer to the next line. Lastly, ensure you remeber the exit no to exit. Else be prepare to walk in circles or walk alot of extra miles!"
222,4.0,"For me Seoul Metro is the chepeast, most convenient and fastest ride you can get to you enjoy and travel around Seoul.The structure of this subway system inside-out is very tourist friendly that even a solo-firtst time tourist wont get lost.The Subway is equiped with easy to understand directions both inside the train or at the terminal. Inside the train, stations are announced in english, there are also navigation system at every door that will give you the information of the stations that the train will passby which include the stations with connecting lines and the door where people will get off are also shown on the screen where the station names are being flashed. While at the terminal, they have maps of the stations which are posted at the pilars supporting the terminal. There are also infoTV showing the train's current location and estimated arrival. Tourist attractions in the vicinity are shown in a map including landmarks and are also listed down and categorized per Exit# so that you would know which exit to take in case you dont know. People in Seoul follows train etiquette which really amazes me because even kids know where to seat."
223,4.0,The best way to get to different places around Seoul. You buy the t pass which cost about 3000 to 10000 won. Once you purchased the t pass add money to it.  There ride is about 1.25 usd per ride. It is user friendly train systems. There are different color trains. Each going to different destinations. All the trains are located underground. Bring your sneakers because you will do a good amount of walking.
224,5.0,"Taking metro in Seoul is easy. Not only ticket machine can be in English, it’s user friendly. Furthermore, metro station and train tracks are organized and clean. We felt very safe taking the metro. I highly recommend as it can save time and money!"
225,5.0,Convenient | Easy | Fast | Covers almost all the part of the city | Easy escape from Traffic on Road | Decently Crowded | Manageable | Safe for Female/
226,5.0,Your first use of a new subway is always a bit daunting but Seoul subway is great. Get yourself a prepaid card and hop on and off whenever you like. Can be very cramped at rush hour times. This is the easiest and best way to get around Seoul.
227,5.0,"From Inchong to Seoul Station Non-Stop. Clean, safe, easy to negotiate, reserved seating, fast, and comfortable. Advice, if you're not young and agile (we're older), choose a departure time that gives you the time you'll need to get to the track. This is NOT a negative, just common sense."
228,4.0,"Easy to use, you can even download some app so you can search the subway direction easier. This is the fastest transportation, we can save our travel time so we can visit more place. It's a good way to lose some weight too, because sometimes you need to walk then take a stairs to change a line haha. But after all this is still the best and fastest transportation if you want to explore Seoul."
229,5.0,"The Korean metro system is extensive - with 21 lines, and is all you’ll ever need here to get around. The metro even goes quite far in the countryside.In essence - during a 2 week stay with plenty of travel, we never had to take any public transport other than the metro."
230,5.0,"I am a buffoon when it comes to tranaport, and rhe Seoul Metro is English Idiot proof, simple Maps simple connections and more importantly ita cheap"
231,5.0,If you're in Seoul then I thoroughly recommend using the Metro to get around as it cheap and really easy to use and not overcrowded like other underground railways I could mention.
232,4.0,very extensive metro line and tourist attraction sites are reachable with the metro. however it is not that disabled-friendly. Some flights of stairs at some stations without elevators or escalators
233,3.0,"The Seoul metro is easy to use, read and understand. It helps to know which exit your destination is close to. The exits are well marked and directional sign posted. There is a difference in trains though. On some one can easily follow the journey with lighted indicators. The sound system that announces the stations is not easily heard. Best to have a T card for quick in and out of stations. The system is similar to many other metro systems in the world."
234,4.0,"Beware the harmless looking little old ladies who will attempt to mow you down if you're in their path. Also, people may not allow you to exit before barging in.  Get ready to fight your way out during peak hour.  And also.. the central heating makes the trains extremely hot and stuffy. Try not to faint. Also some train apps integrate the AREX lines with the metro lines. Beware that although it's stations with the same name, they are not always integrated (ala in the same location)."
235,5.0,You download the app and it’a a very convenient way of transportation when you want to go to different places. You just need to know where you’re going.
236,3.0,"This is the most reliable transport facilities outside Japan that is reliable, efficient and affordable. The station is user friendly, there is an underground shopping thats serves the opportunity for any last minuite shopping.They have 9 lines that connects Seoul to almost every part of the city. Not as busy as the Japanese lines."
237,5.0,Real new york style food. It's so delicious.Every food is tasty clean. small space but food is real good.!!!
238,5.0,Easy find......if u have app subway of koreaEnjoy your vacation First time U must ready by yourself
239,4.0,"Korea has a complex metro system but it's highly reliable. There are many interchange stations and be prepared for extensive walking and climbing of stairs. Not easy to find elevator and escalator in the stations. If you are travelling with kids or elderly, it's easier to take the cab. Train cabins were packed during weekends. If you intend to lug heavy luggages to take airport train back, i would highly recommend the airport bus instead. T Money left cannot be used in Incheon airport transit area except for Starbucks. If you intend to keep the cute T Money card, utilise it at the nearest convenience store or take the airport bus ₩10000."
240,4.0,"Seoul subway is great. Wide cars, I would say wider then in other cities. I always compare it with London tube which makes my claustrophobic each time i use it. I know it's old and all that, but still it's cramped, humid with no aircon... The signs in Seoul subway are in korean and English, everything is clear, easy no find. I gets very crowded in the morning and early evening when people finish work, but not in all areas of the city. Nowadays there's fewer people selling stuff inside the cars so it's good. All cars have wifi available. Aircon works well in summer, it can get a little too hot in winter with the heating on.Overall it's clean, dependable and very safe. Wish it was operating 24/7 but it's not gonna happen as all the taxi drivers would go on strike."
241,5.0,"Love the Metro - get a Suica card for easy use of the trains. The subway maps look intimidating, but after awhile you can use the service like a local."
242,5.0,"The Seoul metro system is very extensive and well-developed. Use a T-money card (purchase at any 7-eleven or other convenience store), load up with money at a recharge machine, and you just tap in and out at the gates. Minimum charge is 1200 won, after a few stops more will be added. At stations, exits are numerous, and in contrast to places like Hong Kong, outside at street level and very close to each other. Inside, stations are well marked in English, but outside the entrances can be hard to spot. If it's nice outside, and you're in the central areas, consider walking outside instead of going 1 or 2 stops. It's only a few blocks between stations, and you might come across something interesting."
243,3.0,"Just like most major cities, Seoul has a subway system. You can load up a T- Money card or just use the recycled cards. Either way, it's fast and easy to get around the city. Most of the train lines say the stops in English and Japanese in addition to Korean. The newer trains also shop stops in all three languages as well. Trains run fairly frequently in city center. The further out you get, the longer the time in between trains. Also rush hour can be a bit mad."
244,5.0,"It is hard to really get excited about a metro in a large city, but this system was clean and comfortable.  Easy to get around with English on every sign.  It was a great way to move about the city for very little cost.  Truly was enjoyable.  The train cars are a lot wider than any others that I have ever ridden.  Almost too clean if that is possible."
245,5.0,"The coloured and numbered subways are great, but the stairs to the train going the correct direction can be confusing. Give yourself an extra 20 minutes to stumble through which direction the train is going. Some trains move on the left rail some on the right rail, so you cannot use that as a guide."
246,4.0,"We were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness, orderliness, and efficiency of the metro.  The signage was easy to read and the announcements in English helped.  Many Koreans speak English well and were kind and helpful.  Long walks from ticket machines to the trains."
247,3.0,"supposedly you can get the T-money refunded at the end of your stay but we never managed to do this - even the tourist information desk at Seoul station didn't have a good answer (they said we could get a refund at a convenience store, but none of the stores in the area would do it, they all said you have to go to the station to get the refund.) You can use the T-money card to pay for things at convenience stores, though, so this is probably the easiest way to use all the money up before you leave."
248,5.0,"As a tourist, it is very easy to use seoul metro. Just buy T-Money for 2500won in convinience store and you can travel around Seoul. It will bring you to anywhere you want. Dont forget to use Subway app to see the subway map and the time table. Ohya, it's very on time!"
249,5.0,"Everything was very well labeled in english, chinese and korean (at least at those stations we were)."
250,5.0,"Is there any one word to describe different feeling?...We had a 4-day tour to Korea with our Tour Specialist Matt Cho and we felt, amazed, happy, enjoy, and satisfied.. there are still more but I think the review page is not enough. Our tour is not the normal tour that a normal first timer will do. What we had was making our KDrama addiction into reality and with the help of This Is Korea tour agency they allow us to customized our own Itinerary. They made sure that we will enjoy our stay. They are very accomodating and fast in answering my email inquiry. We requested to assign one of their good Tour Specialist but they assigned us one of the BEST TS -Matt Cho. He was very patience,  jolly and knowledgeable. While driving, he was able to educate/share to us some of the history in Korea. We really enjoyed his company and we did not felt the language barrier since he speak english fluently. He is also funny and we feel his sincere concern and care while on tour. He is even going above and beyond his duty and task just to make sure that we are happy and fulfilled. In terms of time, he is very very punctual. He is always early from the actual call time and he knows how to maximize our time given the heavy traffic.He even made his own research for additional KDrama series and made sure to bring us at the location and capture the same exact shot.Matt and This is Korea is highly recommendable.Thank you for everything Matt.See you again.."
251,3.0,"The train helped us maximize our time for tours. However, the train lines can get really confusing. We had to walk around 15 to 30 mins to the other side if we were in the wrong direction. If you have a roll-on luggage do not expect to easily find a lift or escalators. We had to carry our heavy luggage around and people are too busy to give a helping hand. Better travel light if you plan to commute via train with your luggage and just like in any other cities, avoid rush hour. I like the fact that it has an express trains too!"
252,5.0,"Easy to navigate and signs are written in English.  Well organized, and clean. Most trains have a car with less AC (good to avoid in summer)"
253,5.0,Fast and trains are very compatible rates are very low we can use very simple Forigin peoples  can use very  easy...
254,4.0,"The metro in Seoul and Busan are efficient and well connected. They have announcement in Korean, Japanese and English. This is an advantage for foreign visitors who cannot soeak Korean. The numbering system for each stop also helps in reaching my destination. It will definitely help if more Enflish or Chinese signage can be placed in the station for directionand transfer. More escalators installed for the elderly and people with walking disabilities is appreciated."
255,5.0,Cherry blossoms is my favourite part of my Korea trip... This place is beyond beautiful no words to describe.. the cleanliness and food. Very busy the time we were there but it’s ok. You just have to be strong so that you can take a nice picture of yours 🤣🤣🤣 anyways you should visit seoul.. you will definitely tell yourself that you have to be back!!! ❤️❤️
256,5.0,Easy to learn and to ride. Although less English language but still easy to understand. Has the looping green line whenever you need it or got lost. Buy T-money card anywhere to start ride.
257,4.0,"The metro in Seoul is super efficient and clean. The prices are very low and if you buy a metro card, remember to turn it back in at the end of the ride in the machines and you'll get a refund on a portion of the ride. Not a bad deal.The metro lines are clearly marked and the metro appears to go just about everywhere in Seoul, so you'll be able to get to where you want to be quite easily. You may have to change lines a few times, but if you follow the app and the signs, you'll be fine.The trains themselves are fairly clean and the people file in/out very quickly. Do not take too long getting on/off, or you may get trapped. The announcements on the train are written in English and Korean, so you'll know where you're stopping next and if you need to transfer or not. Additionally, the trains have little arrows on the signs to let you know which side will open at the next station, so you can preposition to get off.Overall, this was a great and affordable way to get around Seoul if you had some time and wanted to avoid rush hour traffic. I still preferred the taxi system, but that may not be the best choice, depending on time of day and distance."
258,4.0,"It is cheap and convenient for backpackers. However, some stations are quite far. But it is ok cuz the scenery in Seoul is nice for some walk. Need to check the exit for better experience."
259,5.0,"Though my most recent visit was in August 2017. I have used the Seoul Metro to get around the city at various times over the past six years.It's quite easy for an English-speaker to grasp & utilize effectively (including transfers to other lines) so give it a whirl if you're unsure. Three trips in, you'll be a pro!Rated against Paris or London, Seoul's metro system FAR exceeds for newness/cleanliness of the trains/stations.I've also been engaged in very charming conversations while waiting for trains in Seoul - often with grandparents pushing little kids up to me to practice speaking English, while they beamed proudly from a few feet away! You just don't get that level of interaction with locals by taking a taxi. Safe, easy & efficient, the Seoul Metro is your best value transit around the city."
260,5.0,"The Seoul Metro, for someone who doesn't live there, can seem quite daunting. Whenever I visit Seoul, the lines I usually use are 3, 4, 5, 6, 9. The last time I visited Seoul, my friend and I traveled from the Express Bus Terminal station to Itaewon. For that, one needs to transfer lines in Yaksu. Later in the afternoon, we took the metro from Yaksu to Hyochang Park and made our way to Yongsan station on foot. It was not difficult to do at all, nor far. Our end destination was Youinaru to go to the ferry. It was a lot of searching and required an acute awareness of stops. Some people helped us along the way. It was rush hour, too, so the subway cars were packed full, nowhere to sit.After our ferry ride, we decided to take the metro back to the Express Bus terminal. Fortunately, it was just one transfer then one straight line of seven stops. In our fatigued state from the days' activities, that was a small relief. In general, the subway is easy to use, as long as you are careful to know which direction you are heading in and  which stop to get off at. There are seats reserved for the elderly, physically challenged and pregnant women. And there are elevators available at most stops. To have an easy at-your-fingertips subway map, download one of the apps. I used the one Seoul Subway by MyWay. It sufficed."
261,4.0,So many lines but it was friendly public transport.  Fare is ok. T money is like a prepaid card. Can top up in most convenient shop. Also get discount if use t money compare purchase ticket tru machine daily.
262,5.0,The track is so fast. I like it.i went to Suwon with my friends they were also so happy about it. It takes around 24 min to reach there from Yeoungdeungpo. The express train were so fast and luxurious.
263,5.0,ppl here walking fast as fast as their train. if you not sure which station to go you can simply ask to their customer service. they will help you. or just get the map to make sure you dont go to the wrong direction.
264,5.0,Very useful to travel arround The City. If you are lost u can always check the information for tourists kioske or the map
265,5.0,"we took the metro everywhere during our stay and were most impressed. it has a stop for the key attractions. we did not have to join a tour as we gained access to them via the metro. we paid 1450 won single trip to most sights! we just have to know the station's code to purchase the ticket from the machine. it is most user friendly. there is also a refund machine by the exit for the ticket deposit of 500 won. so, do not throw away the ticket. it is the most well planned metro network in the world! each station even has emergency supplies stored in visible and accessible area. highly recommend."
266,5.0,"The instructions and guidelines are clear, the station names is shown by Korean, English as well as Chinese. The subway reaches many famous tourist sight-seeing spots and it is very convenient. Like many subway build-in in other countries,  that elevators are not easily found in every exit in Korea subway system. It would be helpful if more elevators can be placed to facilitate passengers to travel more easily with luggage."
267,5.0,"I've travelled around the world quite a bit, and Seoul's system is easy to navigate and gets you wherever you need to go at an affordable price. With each ride at W1250, it's cheap and easy to get places. Also very English-friendly - you can literally look anywhere (up, down, left or right) and find some kind of subway map and directions in both English and Korean. Also the numbered entrances / exits make it easy to get out and know exactly which direction you're heading in. Enjoy!"
268,3.0,"The metro is very easy and understandable in Seoul. Just don't hesitate. It's much cheaper than taxi. Just buy a T card, put some money on it and off  you go.Best way to discover the city."
269,5.0,"Taking the metro in Seoul is very easy. Everything is in English even the tickets machines have multiple languages to choose from.Best to buy a T Money card which you can use for the metro, bus, purchases at convenience stores etc. Your ride on the metro is also discounted by like ₩100 each trip."
270,4.0,"It was four of us using the metro for a period of 2 weeks. We needed reliable and cheap transportation to go back and forth from Seoul to Osan. We had a plan to visit a number of sites, and were glad to have had such a reliable way to commute safely. Our son who lives in Korea explained the basics to us, so thankfully, we were able to learn the ropes. Riding the metro in Korea is an excellent way to see the country, to observe the culture and to learn about the way of living in that country. We all thought it was quite convenient and cheap. While the metro was convenient and great to move about, we were amazed how unfriendly Koreans were on the metro in general. Not willing to talk to people or help when we asked questions, not very friendly at all. Compared to other cities we've visited around the world, this was disappointing. They don't even talk to each other! Weird! However, given how well instructions are made available to users, the ease with which we can buy the tickets and read information, how good the system is with regard to punctuality, we highly recommend using the Seoul metro. Excellent!"
271,5.0,"Very convenient mode of transportation here in Korea. You don't have to go.On a tour honestly as the attractions are very accessible by metro. It's clean and the map is easy to read.Each ride costs you about 1,500Krw one way. Please ensure you know which direction you're going to because if you wanna switch over, you have to tap out then in again, paying again! Get your T-money card at the airport or any convenient stores. Expect a lot.of pushing here by the locals.There is a seat dedicated to pregnant women and elderly. You can sit there when they're not there but you'd still get stares. Not sure if.I'm sitting there or just cause I'm a foreigner"
272,5.0,"I am always very impressed by the speed and efficiency of the Korea transport system. The train arrival notification tune is definitely useful, coupled with the location of the train on their monitors at the platform. Very reliable information provided. I don't even need to take a cab. However, for the sake of elderly vistors, I hope Korea would replace the stairs with escalators at the subway station. I saw an elderly almost falling on my last visit and worry for her / them."
273,5.0,"The good thing about the subway is that you can choose an exit leading to your destination directly, the exits are in the main spots. You can NOT discover seoul without using the metro, t-money happen to be really easy to handle, you can get from any convenience store, recharge it there or in any machine in the metro stations.The metro is sometimes really crowded but it's ok coz it's fast and clean, the metro is so cheap"
274,4.0,The metro system is huge and the cars are clean but often crowded.  I also like the little convenience stores in the middle. It was much like ant other subway system I have used.
275,5.0,"Although one may get a little overwhelmed initially at the number of stops and lines, it is surprisingly easy to navigate with the help of apps such as Subway Korea. It also helps that all signs are in Korean, English, Chinese & Japanese, and all stops are also read out in these 4 languages. Only gripe is that you have to walk quite a long distances in order to transfer to other lines, and sometimes up and down many stairs."
276,5.0,"Seoul Metro was really easy to use. All signs were in both Korean and English so it was a breeze to navigate. The stations were really convenient with stores and restaurants underground. However, would recommend avoiding high traffic times if you are not used to big crowds and appreciate your personal space because the cars get pretty full."
277,3.0,"If you understand how Tokyo bus systems work, they are very much alike. Biggest difference is there are less English Translations. You should really research where you are going ahead of time to prevent too much confusion."
278,3.0,The routes are really complicated and you have to walk a long way to change to another line... I would prefer to take taxi instead if you are not going too far...
279,5.0,Its so amazing that almost everywhere in seoul is interconnected with their MRT! Its very clean and also at some stations they have friendly guides that can help with directions. Amazed how even old people really make use of the stairs. People here are so health conscious that they encourage the use of stairs rather than use the escalators.
280,4.0,I enjoyed using the metro as it moves fast and the train arrives punctually. I used the metro to travel around and it was super convenient. I don't like to pay 1250 Won per ride which I consider rather pricey since I pay an average of $0.77 in my country Singapore for a short ride.
281,5.0,There are lots of lines that can take you wherever you need to go. It is a very modern system and is on time.
282,5.0,"Just like the Japan metro, this transport is just as efficient and should I say confusing sometimes. So download the Korea Subway App that can be used even offline for you to navigate the train system in Seoul. What I like most is this takes you to the Inchon Airport."
283,5.0,"Get a T-money card and go. Easy to navigate and get around plus wonderful value for money.You can also use the T-money cards to buy things in convenience store, some fast food restaurants, buses and taxis."
284,5.0,"I tried the Seoul Metro in June 2017. The route taken was Samseong Station to Myeong Dong/Dongdaemun Market. We were a bit hesitant at first whether going on the Seoul Metro or other transport/taxi. But our friend convinced us to take the Metro. We went down to Samseong Station, catching the Line 2/Green then transfer to Line 4/Blue. Tickets are avaliable just before the entrance to concourse. We were very surprised that there was an officer, an old man, who speaks English and helped us on the ticketing process. First we must buy the TMobile card for 3000KRW and then ""recharge"" the card for the fare. Desirable amounts for recharge is available from 2000KRW. To enter the concourse, just simply swipe the card at the gate. The Metro schedule is very flexible, it  arrives and departs in every 5 to 10 minutes. The Metro was very clean and comfortable, in busy hours, just expect it will be full so standing up is just the option throughout your journey. The lines are  connected to each other. Just look at the map, which is free in every station, then you are good to go to every station, take attention for the station you passed and where you can transfer between lines. The Metro is reliable, fast, and cheap."
285,5.0,"The Seoul metro is clean, fast and safe.  Highly recommend to get around the city.  Everybody is quite respectful and quiet during their rides."
286,4.0,"Easy to move around using the subway. Payment via T-money card (similar to Octopus card in HK and Touch and Go card in Malaysia). Basic min.fixed fee is Won1,250 per trip. It will deduct immediately upon tapping the card at the gate when entering the station. If journey to outskirts, it will deduct more upon exit."
287,4.0,Busy time early in the morning and after 6!! Be mindful of reserved seats for elderly people!!! Have your map with you at all times. Know where you are going before getting on. It's a little bit complicated. Wheelchair access.
288,5.0,Easy access to metro which is connected to the mall in the hotel.  We took it daily to get around and very inexpensive compared to taking taxi in the city.
289,4.0,"We worked out the Seoul Metro - easy when you know how!Initially we bought tickets at the station; then we learnt we could buy a Tmoney card.  It's 2500won at a convenience store (7 Eleven), then you load your amount on to the card.  The card can be scanned going through the turnstile: much easier!  The cost of the fare can be seen when leaving the station, and the total amount left on the card.Train lines are named.  Stations have numbers.  Tracks are numbered.  And the exits are numbered too (maybe take a photo of the exit when you enter).And if you're not sure which platform side you should be on, have a look on the poles/columns: at the stations are there."
290,5.0,Good transportation easy to use u can paid with t money. To avoid traffic seoul metro is the best way to go anywhere.
291,4.0,A good way to travel but can do better with more instructions in english. We had to keep asking about the directions of the trains as instructions was not written on every pillar.
292,4.0,"Convenient. Clear instructions. You'd better buy a T-money card, it'll let your travel much more convenient!!"
293,5.0,"Seoul has one of the good subway networks in the south korea. It covers well the greater Seoul area. I always use Seoul Metro to go to almost everywhere and very clean and fastest, Most of underground stations have underground shopping market."
294,4.0,Best way to travel around Seoul and I strongley reccommend using the Metro from the airport to hotel
