0,4.0,Took bus #6011 from Namdaemun Market bus stop. It is the last stop.Love the view of the city. Recommend to go up around 5pm to catch the sunset and stay on till night for night view.Bought churros but pricey as it is tourist place anyway.It is very cold as night falls so make sure you wear winter clothes when visiting during winter.
1,4.0,"I stayed at Myondong, near from Namsan Park. I climbed Namsan for a walk feeling after breakfast.Altitude of Namsan is 243m, but was very tired.The atmosphere on the mountain is nice and the scenery of Seoul city was very good.There is the cable car, but I recommend mountain climbing to a tough-footed person.繁華街明洞に宿泊していたので、朝食後、散歩気分でで登山しました。標高は243mですが、意外にきつかったです。山の上の雰囲気はいい感じで爽快なソウル市内の景色は最高でした。ケーブルカーもありますが、健脚な方には登山をお勧めします。"
2,5.0,"accessible by bus or by  cacle car so its friendly to visit even for children, elderly and disabled visitors."
3,5.0,"The walk up the mountain is not very difficult, and can be completed in about 30 minutes if you walk at a good pace and choose the right path. We went up in a path along the Seoul city wall, starting near Namdaemun Market. A refreshing breeze followed us to the top on that day. We passed by statues of Korean leaders, an office building (with vending machines outside), an exercise area (with bathrooms nearby), a photo island (for photos of the city and geo-reference), and a covered rest pavillion, before getting to the Cable car entrance near the top of the mountain (with vending machines outside). Most of the walk is on paved terrain and there are lots of stairs. But the view from the top is amazing, and there are a lot of fun activities and food that can be tried once you get there. If you want to climb it early, keep in mind that the stores (or the tower) are not open until 9 AM or later. Aside from the restocking trucks and maintenance personnel however, the early hours afford more space and time to enjoy the mountain to yourself."
4,3.0,"Went around Namsan Park. Nice, but average park, as compared to other public parks -- Hyde Park of London, Jardin des Tuileries of Paris, Botanical Gardens of Sydney and Canberra, Shinjuku Gyoen Garden of Tokyo."
5,3.0,Visited this place in the evening.  The view of the city below is very breath taking.If you are a fan of Korean Drama this is the place where the leave their love padlock to express their love with their partner.There is a small souvenir shop and also a 7-11 at the foot of the tower it self.
6,4.0,"We were a bit tired so we just walked up to the tram and bought round trip tickets to the peak and back.  Cost was around W9000 each but it saved our feet from climbing up the steep hill after already logging 20k steps that day according to our pedometers!After getting off at the top, the girls first plan of action was to acquire a lock and place it next to  the one placed in March during the other daughters trip.  After a bit of hunting we found the original location but her heart had been removed!  It was quite disappointing since we looked all around the area to figure where it could have gone.  The girls finally settled on a new location for theirs and hopefully it was off to the side and won’t be disturbed to be found in a future visit.We walked to the tower and found a lot more love locks forming trees, locked on hand railings and benches.  Pretty much any conceivable spot that would accept a lock.We opted not to go up the tower as the day was smoggy which would have limited our views.  We did find the views from the base were good at various vantage points.  A deck with glass walls extended partially out from the base of the tower which had seats to enjoy the views.  We also saw the path leading up to the tower and agreed we made the right decision that day.  Maybe next time we will try the climb and experience the natural portion of the park.The ride back down was less crowded so we were able to get front row views."
7,4.0,"We caught bus #2 (or 5) from Namsan Public Library to mountain top. Then either walk down or catch bus #2 or 5 (only 1 stop). There was lots of food outlets, can enjoy view and have lunch/dinner in food court."
8,4.0,We were fortunate to be still able to view magnificent cherry blossom at Namsan. The sakura trees lined the road and over the vast areas of the hill; enchanting!
9,5.0,Namsan Park is where the Seoul Tower is located. The experience started with the cable car ride. The added perks were the offering of free wearing of the Korean National costume and the photo opportunities. Also on this park is the Hello Kitty Island where you can find the Hello Kitty Museum and house. Love locks can be found on an area and also the magnificent view of Seoul from above. There are also shops and restaurants in the area plus the first LED tunnel . Over all this place is recommended
10,4.0,Catch the cable car up and see the views from the top of Seoul Tower. You need to pick your day and ensure you will have clear views from the top. We did not encounter long ques for either the cable car of lifts for the tower. We went in the morning so would expect longer ques at dusk when Seoul is lite up. You can reach the tower by feeder buses from a couple of metro stations.
11,4.0,"I was initially confused when reading the reviews about Namsan Park and N Seoul Tower in Tripadvisor which in fact are at the same place. I almost wanted to skip this tourist attraction but decided to go and there was no regrets. It was snowing earlier and when we reached there, the place looked beautiful.My family decided to try taking the bus as we wanted to save money by not taking a taxi or the cable car. Indeed a good decision!  Since we were staying in Myeongdong, we took the Namsan Circulation bus, a bus that travels on a loop. We almost gave up trying to find the bus stop and asking the locals was futile. I guess only tourists know about this bus. To take this bus, go straight from exit 3 of Myeongdong station. The bus stop will have  a sign  written number 05. The fee is only about KRW1100 by T-money card. We also took the same bus back. We saved so much and it was a pleasant ride to see Seoul city."
12,4.0,"Built during 1960s, this tower was first used as a broadcasting tower to send out Radio and TV signals and then opened to public. This tower which is around 237 meters tall stand on the Namsan mountain providing a panoramic view of Seoul city from a height of around 480 meters.Considered as the first tower attraction of Korea, visit this place to enjoy the 360 degree view of the seoul city. The entrance fee is a bit on the higher side, but the view from the top well compensates for it. The tower complex has lot of shops and food options and a walk up to the tower and back would be relaxing one in the evening.This tourist attraction is well connected by both metro and city bus services. Or you can opt for Cable Car also. The best time to visit would be in the evening. But if you are using metro or city bus take care not to wait for the last service as getting connecting metro or bus services to your hotel may become difficult."
13,4.0,Namsam park provides a nice place to take a walk. The view at the top is also stunning. Great to have a place where people can go for a hike.
14,5.0,Excellent view and surrounding in Nami island...The scenery is beautiful...enjoy out trip there...there is also stalls for you to eat and drinks..
15,4.0,"The park itself is not very big and there's nothing much to DO there if you don't enter the tower (we didn't). It was cold AF in winter (-10C excluding wind chill) but the views were excellent, and oh yes! The Geographical centre of Seoul is right there, in a quiet corner in front of a wooden shed. I'd say, just don't go when temps are below zero."
16,5.0,"We visited on a very cold Monday.If you want to use Namsan cable car, take subway line 4 to Myeongdong Station (exit 4). Walk straight westwards towards the Hoehyeon intersection (Shinsegae Dept. Store and Woori Bank are on the opp corner). Don't cross the road, turn left - walking southwards in the direction of the Namsan Park/Namsan Tunnel 3 - up the hill. The free Namsan Oreumi is located at the entrance of Namsan Tunnel #3 (near the Hoehyeong 119 Safety Center).  It is like a mini Penang Hill Railway.  They are closed for maintenance for a few hours every Monday.Alternatively, you can walk or take the Namsan bus.  I did not take the bus so I am not familiar with it.It is a must see especially for the view and many many locks.  You can purchase light plastic locks at the Namsan Park.  There are many eating places."
17,4.0,You can get a nice scenery of the city up on the park and get up close with the city iconic tower.  Nice place to get some shots.  It was snowing when we were there which made our photos more beautiful.
18,4.0,A Beautiful 360 view and experience of Seoul from the top. Affordable round trip on the Namsan cable car and a must do.
19,5.0,Very colorful and green. Ideal to catch some fresh air. A place where you can relax and capture good pics.
20,5.0,"Namsan Park has many entry points. We walked here from Namdaemun Market which was quite a walk but a beautiful one since we came in the fall. There is a hiking trail where yoy could get a good workout. If you're not up for too much physical exercise, you can take a taxi to the parking spot on top."
21,5.0,"We had a wonderful time taking the cable car to the top of Seoul Tower, the staff were friendly and it was easy to navigate."
22,5.0,I dont mind doing it again. Very nice walk . Meet lots of people . The Surrounding is good for picture. we really enjoy the walk.
23,4.0,"Just a short walk (15mins) from Myeongdong subway station, towards Pacific Hotel, you’ll reach the cable car station. To continue to walk up to Namsan Park, just cross the cross."
24,3.0,Worth for visit but way to go to cable car quite hard to find and long distance to walk but good quality time with family and worth to come in case for enjoy autumn winter feels will definitely come back
25,5.0,Was going Namsan Tower and chance upon this park. Very relaxing and clean park with beautiful sceneries too. Will recommend people with time and small children too.
26,4.0,Have a short fun to the top. We take cable car up and walk down. Hope to enjoy the autumn leave but sadly it not full bloom yet. Walking down can take 20 minute.
27,4.0,"So blessed that i be able to catch autumn leaves. Went on 19 Oct.  Many nice places to take good picture.  Take bus there from Myeongdong is very convenience. No need entrance fee. Only pay if u want to take the cable car or go up to the tower.  There is one foodstall selling tteobokki  ,eomuk and twister potatoes near the love 🔒 with affordable price and chairs with tables for relax."
28,4.0,Best to go here on mid-day wherein you could take good photos with the sun out. I also recommend staying till night so you can see the whole view of the city lights in Seoul. Love locks - one of the most famous thing to visit here.
29,5.0,"namsan seoul tower is an iconic landmark in seoul and well wortht the visit. The nearest metro is Meongdeong and a short walk brings you to the elevator which in turn brings you to the cable car station . The top of the hill is over 300 m and is a fairly large flat area with a plethora of shops, eateries and places to hang out. You can easily spend two hours or so up there. Walking around you can enjoy a 360 degree view of Seoul and its surrounding mountains. If this is not enough , you can go up the tower itself which is another 300 m plus in height ."
30,4.0,"The quickest way to get into Namsan Park with its famous Namsan Tower is by Namsan cable car. The park has Love padlock area just like in Paris, and we can go up to the Seoul Namsan Tower which has great view from the height. If you don't feel to go up, you can explore the area under the tower. The park is also undoubtedly beautiful."
31,5.0,The park is situated on a hilly terrain but is a great way to get to the N Seoul tower with the green areas and the views.
32,5.0,"This is where Korean dramas like to show you thousands of locks. If you go there with a partner/spouse, bring a lock!"
33,5.0,You have to buy tickets for the cable car at the park and then it will take you to Namsan Tower where you can buy locks and put it after writing your name on it or whatever you want. You can also enjoy the view at the top where the weather is very nice and windy there. I would say it is a must go place in Seoul.
34,5.0,We went at night and it was beautiful. You can see the entire skyline of Seoul. It was fun and not expensive.
35,5.0,"This is at the top of the hill.  When you ate on top, you will be able to catch a good view of Seoul city and the surrounding area. You can continue a steep walk up approximately 300 m to the Seoul communication tower and also the love locks area."
36,5.0,"We went in the late afternoon.in myongdong there is a namsan bus that takes you to the tower every 30minutes.various stops .the one that I was going to use was opposite the prince hotel across the road from myongdong main subway station exit 10.but I realised at that stop there is a 7/11 store,where just next to it there is a small lane which leads you to the cable cars.up the way,quite a bit.you should see it sign posted.we went up then and took the cable car from the station,a five minute ride,but wonderful views.namsan tower was lonely with nice eateries nice views,some decent expensive shopping,and the highlight was the VR ride and a 5d 3screen show in one of the shopping areas,a nice day out there."
37,4.0,"Me and my parents took the gondola ride to get to North Seoul Tower from Namsan Park.  Not plenty of parking spots though. If you're looking for parking, go to the science hall a little further up the hill.  And there was a loong line of people trying to ride the gondola so make sure you wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Worth the wait though!"
38,5.0,"Excellent place to come to see the skylights of Seoul at night.  When you get on the tram on the way up make sure to go to the back of the tram and look backwards, and the opposite on the way down, to get the best night-view of the entire city.On top you can buy another ticket to go on the elevator to go up a tower with viewing areas to get a 360 view of the city.Beware, the place is packed, and I mean packed, on weekends.  My wife and her family had to wait 1.5 hours for the tram, and 1 hour for the elevator up the tower, and not much less coming down from neither places.  So if you can, avoid going there on weekends, but do enjoy on weekdays."
39,4.0,an icon of seoul. worth to go. and a place where you can place your love lock. Never seen a place with so much lock before : )
40,3.0,"If you have been up the peak in hkg or mt faber in singapore, this is exactly the types of views you will get, city views. But in Namsan, you get views of some other mountains as well. Up there, you get clear views of the city buildings landscape. If you are searching for a breathtaking nature view, skip this. I find it a waste of time and money. The place is flocked with tourists and locals. Lots of lovers gg up there to ‘lock their love’ so for a family especially with young kids, i think its ok to skip this attraction. I would suggest going to seoraksan at gangwon do for a spectacular view of nature instead."
41,5.0,this is best place to do morning walk in Seoul and you will see a lot of bird and different type of tree.
42,4.0,It is really good to see this sprawling metropolis from up on high.  The cool air and the ability to locate all of the areas of the city and connect them in your mind's eye is great.  Bring a map to really get the best use of the view.
43,4.0,Romantic place. there is so many cutie Panda under the tower. You must lock your heart in here. yeay..
44,5.0,"The park is nice, walk through the path and alot of trees surrounds the area, theres a few rest area too."
45,3.0,Just go for the sight seeing and feel the nature and love is in the air. HihihiIf you stay at myeongdong you can take bus to go back. Bus No. 05.
46,5.0,"Since we were travelling with senior citizens, we took the cable car up the mountain. Its a short 5 mins ride uphill. We had reached the cable car station at 1000am and didn't have to wait in the queue.  It was quite cold in early April, but still got clear views of the Seoul city …. could easily spot the few landmarks - our Hotel, Blue House, Parliament building, Shilla hotel, Lotte world tower, bridges over Han river etc. Lots and lots of love locks creating a colourful atmosphere. The K-drama places add to the charm. Its worth visiting for first timers to Seoul. Walking up the hill would offer viewing cherry blossoms in spring time, which we could only enjoy from the cable car. I guess the evening and night time would be even more charming with the lights lit up. it was an enjoyable visit including the souvenir shopping."
47,5.0,"There are several routes to reach Namsan Park. We took the subway to Line 4 Myeongdong Station. We chose Exit 4 and walked straight and keep left when reached a cross junction. There, we continued to walk, following the direction of N Seoul Tower far in front of us. There was a slope which took us about 10 minutes to walk, then we reached a lift to go to cable car centre.  The fee for one-way ticket is KRW6000, and KRW8500 for a return ticket. The waiting line was acceptable in view of that we went on a weekday. We saw many young local couples here. Not hard to guess as the famous love locks can be found here. There are machines selling love locks together with a marker pen. There are several restaurants, and shops for the visitors. It was enjoyable to be at the Namsan Park. The night was lovely and the weather was cool. For those would like to go up to the N Seoul Tower, the entrance fee is KRW10000."
48,5.0,"Walked to the bottom of the park (or wall) via Seoullo. Dont let the steep looking steps scare you - it is actually a very easy and gentle climb, especially after the steps. Went up with my 2YO and 3YO and they did it effortlessly. After the steps are paths and you can choose the one with a gentle slope. There we resting areas/viewing decks every ~30 meters. We were short of time so we only went up to the Paikbum Kim Gu statue. Coming down we took the steps right next to the wall."
49,5.0,"It's an excellent place to enjoy with family and friends, The view is incredible and you can feel the clean air from the mountain :)"
50,4.0,"The tower observatory is almost always crowded since it is a popular date spot and tourist destination. Views from the observation deck of Seoul are excellent when you can get to a clear spot by the windows. Time your trip up right and you can catch a beautiful transition, as Seoul wakes up for the night. You take a short tram ride up to the ticket office then take another tram up to the foot of the tower itself. There are multiple areas to buy and lock away your love for couples. Coffee stands dot the area. The best views of the tower itself are right off the top of the stairs by covered sitting area. New light displays change colors of the tower often so you don't get the same views each night."
51,5.0,We walked up to the N Seoul Tower which is located in this park. It was a lovely walk - very quiet and safe at night.
52,5.0,Make sure you have a lot of energy cause you will need to do a lot of walking up inclined roads to reach the top of Namsan Park.  But its worth every step!  Great place to take photographs of the city view of Seoul and especially if you take the elevator up to the top of the tower!
53,5.0,"Very good location to get a feel for how expansive Seoul is. When we visited the air pollution was extreme, so could not see much of the city. However, when at street level the pollution was not particularly obvious"
54,5.0,I always visit this Park when I am in South Korea. Specially enjoyed taking the Cable Car ride to enjoy the breathtaking views of the whole City in Seoul.
55,5.0,"The Namsan park is a hilly park leading up to the Namsan tower. It is fun with kids, you can do your workouts there, watch the locals or join in on the fitness equipment. It has small ponds, and is beautifully arranged. It is enjoyable at any season."
56,4.0,We got lost on our way to the tower but good thing is that we were able to explore other area which is also nice and beautiful.
57,5.0,"Loved the views as it had been 25 years since I was here, amazing to see how the city had changed from above... and how much it had stayed the same."
58,5.0,"We bought the two ways cable car ride but ended walking down from the peak of Namsan Park as we could not resist the beautiful scenery and view. The walk down the main road was very pleasant and we were greeted with colourful autumn trees along the way. The cable car which is a single large car was packed with people standing close to each other. Fortunately it was only a short ride of less than 10 minutes. Once we reached the peak, we were rewarded with amazing beautiful scenery of the whole city and the place was very clean and well maintained.  Recommendation: Take a one way cable car up to the TOP and then walk down. As the peak is already very high and provided a very good view of the whole city, I suggest to skip the N Seoul Tower which will not make much of a different and you can save some cost as you need to buy ticket for the N Seoul Tower.Go in the evening to catch the sunset."
59,4.0,"You should be able to finish the circling trail in to three hours comfortably. i would recommend to begin from nandaemun, take the free lift up to the cable car ticket box, take left direction of the trail, visit historical Hanbok village enroute, and finish your trip at Seoul tower. At night you may take a bus down to a tourist destination. I asked the tower ticket box for the information of bus."
60,4.0,"My mom jokingly told us that she was trying to save our spending money by asking us to walk up the mountain to Namsan tower.  It was actually so that we can pass by the ancient city walls and to see the sun set.  The hike was tiring but the paved steps made it easier.  Views were breathtaking once you arrive at the deck area. Definitely try this afternoon hike.  Photos end up amazing, you get some exercise and you save a couple thousand won. Haha"
61,4.0,"We spent half a day there till evening. Tickets bought from Klook, good deal. My daughter was the only reason why we went to Hello Kitty Land (and she thinks this is the best vacation ever!). We have been to bigger Hello Kitty spaces before and personally I wasn't impressed but then again I'm not 6. We were very lucky to be treated with a comedian magician and spent half an hour sitting and watching his show. Namsan Observatory was a great view of Seoul. We ate at one of the Korean restaurants and food was excellent.. I was annoyed at myself for buying ONE lock while queueing up for the cable car for $10USD at the cable car . You can actually buy from a lovely variety when you reach the top. For $10USD u can at least get 2 big locks AND a marker. Overall, it was a wonderful memory for our family."
62,5.0,"Great park with cable car to the top with access to the N tower, restaurant, coffee shops and gift shop."
63,5.0,"Nice place with a great view! You can go around and see lots of lovely locks and trees! The cue for the cable car going up was a bit long but it's okay because it was moving. From Myeong-Dong, suggest you wait for the free shuttle going to Namsan Park as it is uphill. You can get it by subway exit 2."
64,5.0,"The view from the top was magnificent and lovely despite it being a cloudy/foggy day. Its a good place to rest from the busy city. Plenty of things to do in the park, and shops within the mall in the tower! Great cable car up, but also would be a nice place to hike to as well!"
65,5.0,Had a fun day with my son at Namsan Park.. Food at this area is a bit expensive.. But the view is awesome..☝️
66,4.0,Went to namsan park in June and was surprised to see a free hanbok experience at the park! We were honored to be invited to join the drum beating ceremony. The park is a simple and nice place with cooling air even when it's June. The colorful locks on the railings and trees makes photo taking beautiful. Went up to the tower and had a bird eye view of Seoul. It was a pretty nice trip there.
67,5.0,"While visiting Seoul, I rode the cable car up to Namsan Tower to view Seoul at night.  The city was spread out below, sparkling with a million points of light---well worth the time!!!  Seoul in July, however, was a tropical FURNACE!  If you go, I would caution against going in the summer-----MISERABLE heat deterred a lot of activities."
68,4.0,The park is very beautiful.  There is a tram that takes you to the top which is the base of the Seoul Tower.  We went during a very hot day (90+ degrees Fahrenheit and extremely humid). The tram does not have air conditioning.    Even though taking the tram was better than walk up the mountain on the very hot day.
69,5.0,This park in the middle of city offers coffee shops and eateries in the outskirts of the park that lead to great hiking trails.  Many place to stop and enjoy nature or views of the city. You can walk all the way up to the base of the N Seoul Tower.
70,5.0,"lovely to visit if you are in N seoul tower already. a good place to walk and for family with kids. Other than that, it is just a park"
71,5.0,"We went to Namsan Park and took the cable car up to N Seoul tower. There were nice views of Seoul in the cable car and even at the base of the tower. It was a bit pricey but fun. An adult round trip ticket was about 8,000W."
72,5.0,"amazing views of the entire city, pleasant breeze, nice walking around, nice shops, easily accessible"
73,4.0,"If you're looking for a place where you want to chill, take in the city view and walk around, this is the place for you! The park surrounds the Namsan Seoul Tower (N seoul tower). It is also completely free by taking the stairs however you can take the cable car if you don't feel like hiking the stairs (because there are alot!) The cable car is not free but the amount is worth it, you can choose if you want a one way or a round trip ticket. This park is extremely big so morning exercises can be done here! It's best to visit this park early in the morning or at night for the city view!"
74,5.0,The cable car is one of the must-sees in Seoul. It was not that expensive but gives you access to the beautiful views of the city.
75,4.0,We went on a cold rainy day and still enjoyed it. I suggest take a cab to the gondola. Pay to ride the gondola. It will be cramped!!!!  Squish yourself next to the windows to get pictures. Once you depart the gondola there is still a little bit of a hike up a bunch of steps. I didn't see an elevator that will take you up further than where the gondola will drop you off. The restaurants at the base of the tower would be fine and of course that a little spendy and busy. The elevator up the in Tower is really cool because on the ceiling of the elevator have a video as if you are going up through the atmosphere into outer space. Right before you get on the elevator you walkthrough Corridor following the arrows you quickly stop to get a picture that they will try to sell you at the top. We didn't know that they were going to try to sell us that picture but we did find out later that we could go back down retake the picture and then go back up and buy it again. Compared to Disney World and a lot of the other places that take your picture and try to sell you this one was reasonable so we bought two. The viewing deck is pretty cool because it wasn't so cramped and they had names of different countries on the glass above the viewing line so you can easily stand underneath them and point to the ones that you've been to and get cool pictures with the country's name and a view through the glass. The gift store at the top had a lot of unique gifts they even had special discounts on some of their gifts and had something unique for yourselves or just about anyone you want to buy for. Overall definitely a place to go at least once and more times if you have friends or family then come to visit.
76,3.0,Could do. better evening time. Preferably weekday to avoid long queues. Nothing impressive. don't expect HK Peak view.
77,4.0,This place is great place for hiking or just take a walk. But I don't suggest when it's summer. It will take about 40 minutes and You will also meet the great view!Most of people will love Namsan Park I guess.
78,3.0,You can access to cable car by free shuttle bus from Myeongdong station. There are 2 options to reach Namsan Tower which are by hiking or cable car. Need to wait patiently for cable car due to very long queue and visitors have to stand for about 2 minutes in a crampy cable car.
79,4.0,It's one of the ways to get to the sky tower and I would say the preferable way. There is a bit of waiting (30-45mins) so plan accordingly esp if you are going in the evening as people try to see the sunset from the top. You get good views of the city as you go up. Plan to stand facing the city vs the tower as the tower side is just bushes
80,4.0,The cable car ride was short but it gave you a great view of the city as you go up the N Seoul Tower.
81,5.0,"it is a good place to go and have some quite and refreshing time when you are really tired, and stressed."
82,5.0,"Namsan Park is a quite good place to see Sakura and take photos for cameramen, if you have a chance, wear your wedding clothing to Namsan Park at around Early-Mid Apr to take photos with Sakura and the couples. If you can't go up to N Seoul Tower, the ground floor also can see the whole view of Seoul. Tips: You should wear a sport shoes up to Namsan Park Cuz you need tkt walk from bus stop to the ground floor of N Seoul Tower. Tips 2:You should see the weather forecast to n plan before you go. Raining and foggy can't see anything!"
83,5.0,Nice and tidy park with plenty of open space. Taxi don't go here so remember to take the tram or hike up there. Worth the visit if going up to the tower. Cherry blossom during April was beautiful.
84,5.0,"From the cable car to the tower on the top of Namsan, the whole experience was pleasurable and affordable. With a stall that offers visitors the experience to dress in traditional Korean garb and traditional dancers and a military like parades being performed, it made the cultural aspect of the visit all the more vivid and exciting."
85,5.0,"Wonderful place to explore , day and night view is fantastic.. weather during winter time is the best 🙂and the lover bridge Lock 🔐 is amazing .. and there is seoul plaza for u to eat , shopping and view ."
86,5.0,"Found an easy direction to Mt Namsan.  It was during Winter last Dec, 2016.  We packed kebabs and bought hot teas on the way up.  It was super super cold !  We just walked slowly and enjoyed the views and took many pictures on the way up.  Air was very dry as it was during the Winter.  Our host told us it was the wrong time to climb up Mt Namsan as it will be extremely cold.  But we just don't care.  Found a spot to placed our locks too.  It was an experience which we will remember.  We will be back in March (Spring) to place another lock.  See you there !"
87,5.0,"Great addition to the Namsam tower trip, taking the cable car is veyr nice and gives you a good view of Seoul. The park itself is beautiful and is a really scenic spot"
88,5.0,We visited Namsan Tower in the early to last evening so we could enjoy the colorful lights.  We were actually there when the tower was green and turned to yellow.  So much fun and great views.
89,4.0,"It was one of the coldest day and we were advised not to walk up, which normally takes about an hour.  We parked at the bottom of the cable car station and took the cable car up.  Cable car runs every 10 minutes and provided a great view of Myeongdong going up  Once on the top, there were many good ""picture spots"".  There were also many love locks, a resemblance of ""Post de l'Archeveche"" of Paris.  We also took the elevator up the Seoul Tower and were able to see a 360 view of Seoul.  Kids took the opportunity to write and post postcards to their grandparents at the tower.  Professional photos were taken and we got one for KRW12,000.   I would try walking up / down the park or visiting during night time next time."
90,4.0,"Recommend taking taxi from City center, like Myeong-dong to the cable car station of Namshan, which is close. The people traffic administration was dong not too humanise that, in order to keep discipline between going uphill and downhill, they close straight the elevator, and making people in needed absolutely inconvenient and difficult. Cable car was running stable and and good, a short ride leading you uphill, but the light around seems not good enough for you taking pictures. The size of Namshan Park was not big, filled with tourist center, shops and restaurants, and also admission office for tickets sold boxing up N Tower. But a good place Taking photos, which you need to equip with night low night function."
91,3.0,Lots of little traditional villages around Seoul so if you are doing the tower then spend some time in Namsan and knock off two things in one..
92,4.0,"We arrived before 5pm and the queue was 1h long. As the queue snakes up from the ticketing area to the boarding area, Korean ahjumas simply skipped the queue and barged past. After 20min, we reached the second level of waiting room where there is a snack bar and washroom. Then it was another 30min to board the cable car.Do not expect luxurious ride. They packed around 30 odd passengers in each cable car. If you do not get near to the sides of the cable car, the only view you will have is people's armpit. Please try to squeeze to the sides to have a decent view.The 8500 KRW is for two way ride without the tower. By the time we each the park, it was dark. We were planning to see the transition of day into night. Perhaps you will need to start one hour earlier. From the park, you get a magnificent view of the city. Beautifully lighted up. Fortunately the queue for the descent was not as long. About 5min."
93,4.0,"It was a very cold afternoon but we braved the weather to be at Namsan Park and Tower.  Rode the cable car to the top.  The park wasn't a great site as winter had set in but the other attractions in Namsan were still worth looking out - the love locks, the Christmas tree and the beautifully-lighted tower.  We drank our hot cocoa and coffee while looking at the city of Seoul from the tower.  The lights  were so nice."
94,4.0,Took this ride rather than pay $200 to go up Taipei 101 for the four of us. Cheap and relaxing up and down. Get a return ticket as it can be difficult to get alternatives down and it saves lining up for the tickets again.
95,5.0,"It took us about 2 hours to hike at an easy pace all the up to Seoul Tower fromThe foot of the hill.  The paths are easy  and the walk was easy for my youngest kid who is 8 years old.  At this time of the year the maples are still hanging on to some autumnal colours so there are hues of yellow and red in the surrounding vegetation.  At the summit, there is the rewarding view of Seoul, several eateries and the interesting chimneys that were historically used as fire and smoke signals."
96,5.0,"I love this park. can be accessed for free via hiking, or for a small amount via a cable car ride. at the park, there are some performances by locals showcasing korean culture, dances, acrobatics. if you are lucky enough, there's a booth that lets yo wear the hanbok for free! totally awesome. there is also a toy museum, for toy fanatics."
97,4.0,A nice walk to reach to the N Seoul Tower. NIce autumn leaves and good view of the city from the top. Fresh air and good exercises.
98,4.0,"To access to N Seoul Tower, you will need take the cable car. Can see nice view through the cable car."
99,4.0,"View was nice, went there on a day when the weather was good! Beautiful city views but a bit too crowded! So did not manage to get a lot of photos..."
100,4.0,"The tower and its views are the reason to visit.But it gets heavingly  busy around sunset for obvious picturesque reasons. So go after sunset, but still be prepared for queues to get up the tower. The queues for the lifts down again are twice as long as those to get up. There is no staircase option.The views on a clear night are stunning and photos can't really capture this or do it justice.If you use the men's loos's (the urinals with the best view in the ?world) don't be surprised by people taking paicture, it's not you it's the views."
101,5.0,Beautiful park with nice view of Seoul from top. Parks are clean and well maintained. You can take cable car to the top or slow stroll enjoy the beautiful green surrounding
102,4.0,It is a short walk from Myongdong and in your way you can visit Animation Center. You can take the stairway going up or the cable car. It worths the trip and you will enjoy the nature in cloudy summer day as I did with my kids in hiking up the mountain.
103,5.0,You have to know that every Korean work till old age and many seniors work to keep the streets and the park clean. This park is perfect if you want to relax or workout with beautiful view points on the city. I normally go early morning. It gets crowded (not much anyway) only during the weekends.
104,4.0,"It has good view for Seoul, there are painters if you love having a painting for yourself and some coffee shops. also the famous love locks are there"
105,5.0,"Namsan Park was beautiful in the summer, and we loved the historic glimpses of the ancient walls protecting Old Seoul. The beacon lighting ceremony was canceled due to high heat, so you may want to phone the park to ask about the beacons (interesting even un-lit). Many couples proclaim their undying love there by attaching colorful locks to the various displays up top, then throwing the keys away down the mountainside. There are many stairs even after taking the cable car up the mountain.  If you are mobility impaired, you may need the help of a Korean guide to navigate the elevators and alternate pathways."
106,4.0,"This park completely surrounds the Namsan Tower and gives you many ways up and down,  I would bet the most popular is the one beneath the cable car.  We chose to take the cable car up and walked down.  We visited the tower at night and slowly enjoyed the view on the walk down. I would encourage you to take this option you see the view and it is the least strenuous way to enjoy the park."
107,4.0,"We took the cable car (8500 won for return trip) to the top of Namsan Park.  The Namsan Cable Car Station was about 15 minutes uphill walk from Myeongdong area. (If you don't want to walk to the station, there is a slanted elevator connecting Namsan Tunnel 3 to Namsan Cable Car Station, the elevator is located in front of the commemorative monument at the entrance of Namsan Tunnel 3. ) We went there during a week day and the place was not crowded. The park was a good place to view the city .  The 'love knots' square was an attraction to those who loved watching Korean TV drama. There are public buses to Namsan Park and the Tour bus also stopped there."
108,4.0,"We previously took the cable car to the top, but feeling energetic decided to walk this time.  Note that you can take various routes to the top.  The short routes involve lots of stairs.  We did that going up and were huffing and puffing.  We took the gorgeous rubber coated path going down and it was much more pleasant, with lots of people watching, waterfalls and restrooms.  When we got to the top there was an demonstartion of traditional Korean swordsmanship.  Nice surprise!"
109,4.0,"Best place to view the city.  Not sure about all the ""love locks"" - a metal recycler's dream!  Loved the ancient wall remains.  Also loved the view from washroom in the tower!"
110,5.0,"It is just opposite Grand Hyatt where I stayed, it has a nice trail leading to the tower. The scenary is beautiful, make a pleasant morning walk for me. There are lot of facilities along the way as well."
111,4.0,This is a gorgeous park to walk in the heart of Seoul. The gardens are well kept and there's almost no traffic (except city busses). We didn't go up the tower as we felt it was too pricey. The view of the city can be seen from the decks around the top of the mountain anyway.
112,5.0,There is a wonderful view. Flowers and monuments are beautiful. Near to the N Seoul Tower (like 15-30 minutes).
113,4.0,"We took the cable car up to the bottom of N Seoul Tower and found that the ""park"" area at the top is super small. The ""locks"" area is so crowded that it's hard to find a spot to take a good photo.If you feel strong and have ample amount of time, I would recommend walking up to the park along the old castle walls."
114,5.0,"We actually live very near here.....day or night it is a beautiful location with many things to enjoy. Peaceful trails, well lit at night, incredible landscaping, waterfalls and all within easy access from the subway system.Can't go wrong with a visit here!"
115,5.0,This is a very nice park with lots of green space.  We walked through the park up to North Seoul tour.  It was very nice and relaxing.
116,5.0,"I highly recommend the Namsan Park.  The park is well maintained, the hike to the top is not too difficult, and its a little bit of nature in otherwise urban Seoul.  The hike up isn't overly crowded, although it is always crowded at the top (with buses and the gondola delivering many visitors).  If you are in Seoul, it is a must do."
117,4.0,"The cable car up to the top is fun on its own, although it's not compulsory of you feel energetic. It's not a big park, but a good way to see the city. It's very popular with young couples and livers, whom place their padlocks and pledges of love onto railings etc., which is quite cute, but still a nice place to go if you have a spare couple of hours."
118,5.0,"We unwittingly walked through the park - originally meant to go to the last stop at N Seoul Tower, but we got off at the second last stop. However, this meant that we had the park almost to ourselves (we were the only tourists around and the rest were Koreans enjoying the view). The view along our stroll to the tower (which was around 3km approximately) was beautiful! Highly recommended!"
119,3.0,"We waited for the elevator service as we were pretty walked out from previous day's sojourn, it's already a fair bit of stair climbing when you get off the cable car. At the top they have done a good job to make it interesting, from viewing platforms, restaurants, love locks, a short cultural show and of course the tower. We skipped the tower as it was really hazy so nothing to see, it appeared that others were of the same mind."
120,4.0,"Not to far from downtown Seoul, you can reach Namsan Tower easily by bus. Great view and scenery. Up hill by foot or bike will be a good exercise for your heart."
121,4.0,See surrounding view from hilltop of Seoul. Quite a hike if you walk it like we did. Winding paths take you up to the top. See locks of love. At bottom of hill are restaurants and namdaemun market.
122,5.0,It's worth the cost of the tram ticket to get to the base of N Seoul Tower for the views alone.  Walking around the area where all of the locks were is nice and it is a nice walk back down the hill.
123,4.0,seoul have a nice park and i envy them. how can a nice park exist in a city. it on the top of the mountain where N seoul tower is located as well. really nice for relaxation and sightseeing.
124,4.0,"As I come from a part of the world where it does not ever snow, my review is slanted towards fascination with snow. We were very fortunate to arrive in Korea on 2nd Dec 2015, for it started snowing that same night, and continued with greater intensity the next morning. (The next 5 days of our stay saw ""beautiful"" weather - sunny with clear blue skies!) And so when we reached Namsan Park at around midday, much of it was covered in snow. Under these circumstances the bus ride up the mountain was all the more special."
125,5.0,refreshing seeing all those scenic view from above Seoul. its even nicer at night when the tower comes to life with those lights. Its also in the heart of seoul so better walk if you want to go to Myeongdong which we did.
126,4.0,"This is a great park to get a good hike or run. There are trails running all through the park, many of which end up at the tower. Many are not stroller friendly but good for walkers or runners groups without small kids unless you take the road to the top."
127,4.0,"Spring is a good time to visit Namsam Park. There's cherry blossom trees that line the walkways and it's provides a beautiful sight of nature at it's best. Also, the weather is good to walk about Namsam Park, there's restaurants and cafes to get food and scheduled performances of traditional arts/dances so do check out the timings when you're planning a trip there!"
128,4.0,"Picturesque 20-30 minute walk/hike to Namsan Tower with a few lookout spots with commanding views of the city and portions of the fortress wall. Note that as of 26DEC2015, the main stairway/path to the tower is closed, forcing you to go around the backside of the mountain, which is also under heavy construction, lots of large machinery and unpleasant construction noise for the first 1/3 of the hike. This path takes an additional 10 minutes, but does provide a nicer stroll passing portions of the fortress wall.  Else, you can take the gondola and bypass the closure and construction to reach the tower."
129,4.0,"Cable car is overpriced for the 3 mins ride. Not much of a view as it is often crowded with tourist and before you know it, you've reached the top. Better off taking a slow walk up and down. Or take it up and walk down the hill."
130,4.0,"The park is really big, very well maintained, feeld very secure and has many plants to look at. We went from the Grand Hyatt to the Tower and back - very nice walk, though steep at times. app. 90 min. Being in the center of Seoul, the woods really pleased us because the City is exhausting..."
131,5.0,"+ very colorful autumn leaves+ we took the cable car down oneway at 6000won per person,  it is slightly cheaper if return at 8500won per person, but the way up was definitely more crowded than the way down. besides it is much cheaper by bus 1200won per person bus no 5"
132,3.0,"As for the surrounding park, it can be most aptly described as 'average' (as the 3/5 rating would suggest).The cable car has a tendency to get outrageously packed especially during peak seasons (early autumn and summer holidays). Furthermore, activities are few and far between. As a standalone park, it's mediocre at best so unfortunately it's difficult to recommend to visitors."
133,5.0,"We went up there yesterday, it's not over priced, you can walk up and down or get the cable car one way or return. The view from the first area is great if that's all you choose to do but we felt that as we had made the effort to get there we really had to go to the top so we paid the extra to go up the tower, well I'm so glad we did. It is an amazing view from the tower, you can walk the entire floor to get the view from every aspect. There is food, coffee, souvenirs & snacks up there if you want to spend a longer duration enjoying the view. I would imagine it's awesome at night if they stay open which I imagine they surely would? There are numerous restaurants and coffee houses at the bottom."
134,5.0,"A wonderful place to visit, either during the day or at night, irregardless of whichever way you went up from."
135,5.0,"We took 2 types of cable cars up to the N Tower, enjoyed martial art performance, doing a Korean style of locking our name in the bridge underneath N Tower, then walked down 5min & took the bus downworth to enjoy the hilly way. 3 hours maximum coz my kid really enjoy the royal martial art performance."
136,4.0,"We came here around 4pm in the afternoon, we walked around and took day view's picture, before sunset then we bought ticket go up to the Namsan Tower(their amazing lift juz take a few second go to the top), night time u can see Seoul's beautiful night view.."
137,5.0,"I have been to Namsan Park several times. I've taken the cable car to Seoul Tower, and I have also hiked to the tower from the base of the park near the Grand Hyatt Hotel.  I really recommend hiking there because the base of the park is just as if not more beautiful than the area where the tower is. The landscaping around the base of the park has so many types of flowers and trees, and there is also a wonderful botanical garden to walk around. It probably takes about 20 minutes to walk around the base of the park, and then it takes another 35 - 40 minutes to walk up to the tower. On the walk up, there is  great look-out point, and there usually aren't too many people there. If it seems like it will take too long to walk up, consider that there is often quite a long line to take the cable car up to the tower, and so walking is better (and free)!"
138,4.0,Nice to do especially when it's hot (35 C). This ticket does NOT include the entrance to the N-Tower! It should suffice to go one way (up) and stroll back down. Clean and quick.
139,5.0,"Namsan Tower provides and awesome panoramic view of Seoul.Make sure you go on a clear day.  We took the Cable Car up the mountain.  Beautiful pics of the landscape.  However, we did not visit the restaurant."
140,5.0,"It is a long walk from where you get off at the cable car, but the view of the city is well worth the price, which seemed reasonable compared to th CN Tower in Toronto."
141,5.0,"Come here and put love locks if you are visiting with your lover. This place is definitely a must to go place if you ever visit seoul. You can see the city of Seoul from the top, it looks pretty especially at night."
142,3.0,"Place is really crowded with tourist. Can barely take a decent photo. We took the cable car both ways (large standing type), and we were packed like canned sardines.On arrival, there is still need to climb up the steps. And do not bring you all the way up the N tower. We didn't bother asking if we can go any further up coz visibility was poor, doubt we can see much anyway.Took a pic of the famous N Tower and pictures with the thousands of color locks as background, then head back down."
143,5.0,"Prepare to climb, prepare to walk.  There is a motorcar that takes you up the mountain so you dont have to climb those gazillion stairs. The view is awesome and a lot of history if you are into that sort of thing"
144,4.0,"Its worth the trip in the cable car to get to the namsan tower.  You have to pay again to go to the top of the tower but once you get up there, you get an appreciation for how large Seoul actually is.  You're paying for just a view so if you are into views than this is worth it."
145,4.0,"There is construction along the city wall, so we didn't go up the way we had planned, but we had a nice walk up to the top of the hill with a great view.  At the top there were lots of cultural demonstrations of dancing and fighting which really intrigued the kids.  We were able to walk down the way we had planned to come up."
146,4.0,I loved the walk with the botanical garden feel. Cute pond with fish and turtles and lots of beautiful flowers.
147,4.0,The Namsan Tower is very small but my kids really enjoyed going up to see the panoramic view.  The park at the top of the cable cars seemed small but we were still happy to experience an iconic part of Seoul!
148,3.0,"Decide to have fun at Namsan Park if you're going to visit. You have to go up up up to see the fences and trees of million love padlocks. Some are new but many are rusting. There are also tiles of love messages. You can join the trend and place your own lock or tile - bring your own or buy there. There's a little alive museum, a small café, a view from above and thousands of people visiting the place. The ice cream with churros was toothsome."
149,4.0,Namsan Park has a great view of the whole cityscape. The park is clean and has good food establishments on top. Definitely a good place to go to for a couple especially if interested in adding to the love locks in the park.We came on a bus with our tour but I heard that some of my other friends got there through cable car. There were a lot of other tour busses when we went there. It was packed with tourists and locals. Only got to stay there for around 30 minutes but it's a good place to eat dinner and spend around an hour with a loved one.
150,4.0,"If you've watched enough k-dramas, then this place will be familiar to you and worth going to. Buy a lock to add to their wall of locks. You have to pay to going up inside the tower. It wasn't that impressive and bit pricey but worth doing at least once. You can look all around Seoul from up there but you can get a similar view from outside the tower without having to pay, plus no smudgy glass to get in the way. We went during the day but the view from up in the tower is probably more impressive at night. However, we did get a bird's-eye-view of a martial arts performance they were doing in the grounds at the entrance of the tower. We also took a the cable car for a roundtrip tour. I wouldn't do that again unless I was tired or short on time or possibly during the spring when everything is in bloom (we went in November). But with the car being crowded, unless you get a window view, it's not really worth it, unless  you are using it for convenience. Otherwise, the hike looked like it would be a much better experience. The gift shop has some cute things as well."
151,3.0,The Seoul tower is really prominent that you can see it from every corner of the city. I think the tower is OK but to climb to the tower is really hard time for me. Quite regret coming here but I need place to kill time.
152,3.0,We didn't go up the Namsan Tower but just enjoying the surrounding park.  Pretty spring flowers in bloom.
153,4.0,But 0.5 hour is enough.Hiking would be nicer (About 1 hour~1.5 hour)Recommended at night time.  you can see all couple from all of the world
154,3.0,"Cable car ride up is less than 5 minutes, so get a window stand.  Better to walk down or up for the treelined views.The top is historical, but it gets lost with the modern edifice.  This reminds me of the Space Needle and other high points of cities.  If you miss it, it's not big deal.My second time.   The first time, I went to the top tower for a meal.  Your not going to get good meals on any spinning restaurant in the world, but you are paying for the view."
155,5.0,We had a pleasant few hours hiking up the Namsan Park trail on an early Spring day with cherry blossoms in full bloom.  Very safe and clean.  Some stretches with steps that could be challenging for some. Also took the ride up the tower for view of the city.  I am an urban planner so the view was of interest to me.  The vast scale of the city beyond the downtown is a surprise. Others might not find the tower worth the time and cost.
156,5.0,Love the views and weather. It was also nice to go on a hike all the way up. Bit of exercise and coupled with serenity and reverence is a perfect opportunity to relax!
157,5.0,"If you like hiling, especially when the blossoms are blooming, the weather is mild, yet getting warmer, then go take a hike. Buy a lock and tie it to one of the fencing rails at the top."
158,3.0,"It is rather a park for daily exercise than for tourist.  If you eat too much after shopping, I recommend you to walk here and take nice pictures of Seoul city."
159,4.0,"we spent 1-2 hours herewe took taxi from myeongdong area for only around 4 usd dollarYou will need to purchase cable car ticket return around 7 usd dollarHere you can buy a lock then write you name on it then you attach it to to the fenceYou can view seoul city from here.For older people,be careful there are plenty of stair steps"
160,5.0,Took the cable car ride up to Namsan Tower. Very nice scenic view. Tourists and senior citizens above 65 (if I do not recall wrongly) can purchase a cheaper cable ride.The walk to Namsan Tower is good exercise to take in the beauty that the park can offer. The legendary locks put up by visitors and loving couple is a usual scene in a lot of Korean Dramas. There is also a Teddy Bear Museum. Remember to take in the top-of-the-world view of Seoul from here.
161,3.0,"We have been to Seoul for the Lunar New Year, so queues were long at major attractions. So in case you see people lining up outside the building, the waiting time will be at least 60-90 min.The tower did not look very far from the cable car station, so we decided to walk. The way up is a little bit steep and you many stairs. But some nice stops on the way make the climbing worthwhile. There are an outdoor gym and some nice photo points. You might need 40-60 min for the way. The walk is ok, but we thought that the view from the top is not very spectacular.Consider going up if it is a misty day. Our hotel was opposite the hill and most of the time we could not see the tower."
162,4.0,Namsan Park gives you the best scenery of Seoul and you can see the whole Seoul at a glance.  It is also very well know for the great jogging path for the people who jog.This is exceptionally great place to enjoy the colorful leaves during fall which is from late September to early November.
163,4.0,"Took a taxi up to the cable car tower. A big cable car for a big group of people. Short distance but magnificent view during the night time.Tickets for the cable car are cheap for to and fro, anytime you can go back but just before they close at 11pm (IIRC).Ate at the burger outlet there, food aint fantastic.If anyone would like to enhance their experience with N-Grill, please get a prior reservation and approach the Korea Tourism Board for discount.FYI: There are places for you to hang locks with what you want to write for couples. Overall: Night view is always the nicest with those lights."
164,3.0,"We didn't really come to the Namsan Park to visit the park but to get to the cable car station to take us up to Seoul Tower. The nearest subway station is the Myeongdong station, line 4, exit 3. Walk towards the Pacific Hotel on the right of it. It's a hard uphill slough so be prepared for some hard work."
165,5.0,Loved the little parks with exercise equipment. Very peaceful and enjoyable walk up to the Tower.  The views of Seoul on the way up were good too.
166,5.0,Great view from the top. Nice Lunch option available at a reasonable price with no pressure to leave. Cable Car a good way to get up.
167,4.0,"My family without two young kids walked from the Millennium Hilton Hotel were we were checking out the Christmas train. We walk across from the Hilton NAND followed signs toward the park walking along the reconstructed wall. We walked by the Patriot Ahn Jung-geun Memorial Hall and the Namsan Public Library. It looks like it would be a lovely park to stroll through in the warmer months. There was barely anyone on use paths we took.  We were trying to find the bottom of the cable car to take it up but instead we were walking on a sidewalk on a street that was heading up the hill and found an entrance to the park that was all steps. We ended up walking this way all the way to the top and came out by the cable car station. There were just a few locals on the stairs we took and there were many lookout points to see in a few directions. Vey nice and peaceful.  Once at the top we saw the lovers locks that you can buy for 5,000-7,000 to hang. Also some shops for food.  The demonstration show was going on by the bottom of the tower which my oldest enjoyed watching the traditional dressed guys use weapons. The observation deck for the tower costs 9,000 per adult and wasn't worth it. Saw so much just on huge walk up. The cable car was 6,000 per adult and wasn't worth it as you are crammed in standing up and can't see out. At the tower are some restaurants and Cold Stone Creamery along with the usual expensive souvenir shops. I recommend spending the time walking up the back unused stairs to avoid the crowds and enjoy the scenery."
168,4.0,"My second time here in two years.Took cable car up, a short journey from the base . But to get to cable car station requires climbing up slope n stairs , quite tiring tough.They have replaced the teddy bear museum with ALIVE MUSEUM. We enjoyed it .Took the public bus no 5 down to Myeongdong. We had to endure a terribly long 45 minutes wait under chilly -2 degree temperature. Lousy experience !"
169,5.0,Must visit place in seoul.... in namsan park is N Seoul Tower... U can use cable car or climb up the hill to reach to the tower....
170,4.0,"If you want to see the love locks ""museum"" to see the lock of love of couples  tourist and locals and have a view on the N Seoul Tower,  come here!"
171,4.0,"A nice place to see the view of Seoul, entrance fees are a bit pricey and you need to pay to take the cable car or the bus to it. Its a bit of a walk to the cable car station from Myeongdong, or if you take the bus, from the bus station to the tower itself."
172,4.0,"If you watch Korean drama, then you'll immediately recognize the place. The cable car is a good transportation up to the tower. Great place for lovers too if you want to lock your names with an amazing picture view of the city. There are also various food places to eat and places to walk around. As a FYI, the teddy bear museum closed down but there is still a gift shop. Definitely still a good place to visit when in Seoul."
173,4.0,"A great walk up to the top, especially at sunrise. Skip the tram on the way and and hoof it up! Take the tram down, but it's a beautiful walk."
174,4.0,"I went to Seoul in late October, the time when the red leaves in Korea was starting to get full blown. If you only got time for touring around the city but still want to look out for red leaves, it is a place to be. When you first arrive at the cable car station you would already see the Namsan covered with trees in red leaves. As you are riding the cable car the scenery just get prettier as you are going onto the top of the mountain. I went to the park as my first stop of my Seoul trip, we were just off the planes in the afternoon so there wasn't a lot of time on hand to visit the place before sunset (the sun usually sets at six in late October), but I would guess going up by cable car and then stroll down the mountain would be a very good way to enjoy the red leaves. We brought some snacks for picnic, and also saw the sun set  -  a very relaxing way to end our first day at Seoul"
175,5.0,The view from the top of the North Tower is incredible once you get there. Take your time and walk up to the tower. There are many photo opportunities and  it is great exercise. Fall colors made this trek even more enjoyable. The cable car was reasonably priced and again great photo ops just be sure to get ahead of the crowd and in the front of the cable car. I would do Namsan and the North Tower again!
176,5.0,"If you want to escape from city and relax in the woods Namsan is the best place also you can make Gym at open area gym center, it's free."
177,5.0,very clean place and good view and good experience in N Seoul Tower
178,3.0,"Went there on a morning and it was heaven, very picturesque! I love how autumn made the trees there look extra beautiful. ^_^Two things though: the observation deck is, sadly, a tourist trap, and the teddy bear museum was closed! =(The entrance fee to the observation deck is a rip-off! For a small place to roam at and no free activities to do while you're at it, a tourist's 9000 won is not worth it. The management should start doing something about it and add more interactive, free, and tourist-friendly activities there.And why was the teddy bear museum closed? Sad. =("
179,4.0,We had a lot of fun walking around here and there were a lot of things to see. Seoul Tower was the best!
180,4.0,"If you an adventure and nature junkie, hike up Namsan Park towards the tower. You can enjoy sightseeing some nice architecture and sceneries along the way."
181,4.0,"This park offers 3 interesting features.  Firstly, it offers an very challenging and interesting walk uphill if you start from the street level.  Alternatively you can catch a cab or the public bus that takes you uphill to a station that is just a short climb to the peak.  The climb is breath taking.  The reward of the view at the peak is alright.  It offers a common enough hilltop view of Seoul. Secondly, visitors could time their visit to watch the free cultural song and dance show coupled with a martial arts demonstration.  The show is entertaining and spectators had fun.  Thirdly, a the park is beautiful, peaceful and scenic. There is quite a lot of visitors but there is still plenty of room            to move around in a relaxed pace."
182,5.0,"Easy walk from the Myeongdong Metro Station, Line #4, exit #7.  Cross the main road and walk up the hill towards the Seoul Tower - about 5 minutes.  You can take the cable car tram up the mountain to the top of the park.  At the top are fantastic views of Seoul, many attractions, museums, the Seoul Sky Tower, restaurants and cultural shows in ancient costume.  You and your loved one can buy a small lock and place it on the fence on the top of the mountain to symbolize your eternal love for each other !!"
183,4.0,"Did a small hike up to N Seoul Tower via Namsan Park. It is not that intimidating if you are able bodied. Walking up the trail somewhere directly opposite the Millenium Seoul hilton hotel, you will reach a cable car station maybe 1/3 of the climb. If you so decide, you can take a cable car up."
184,4.0,"Area around Seoul Tower. Lovely park area in the center of a Seoul. Very populqr with tourists. We took the cable car up and walked down. A bit disorienting as to where we were when we reached ""bottom"" but that's why we have smart phones, right?"
185,4.0,"Nice park, clean. Take a break from the city. But if you are going to walk up to the N Seoul Tower which is here at the park, be prepared for the climb, Its all uphill!Alternatively you can grab a bus from the bus stop in the park."
186,5.0,A modest walk from the Sejong Hotel.  Took cable car to Seoul Tower and walked back down.  Try to visit when it is less crowded.  Views from Seoul Tower at night were beautiful.  Walking back down is a little challenging but okay.  Lots of stairs that are not evenly spaced.
187,3.0,Go at times when they have cultural performances. We missed one (light beacon ceremony) which is at 4pm. I believe they have it in the morning around 11? Do check before heading there.Nice romantic views from the top with lots of love locks around. Other than that it was rather boring and overrated.The cable car was disappointing. There is only ONE cable car and for every ride they tried to fit in as many people as possible into it. It felt like as if you're in the metro (so packed like a sardin can) but you're paying 8000 won for a round trip. Not very value for money if you ask me- the ride was short (3mins) and the view you get a you go up is kinda average. I suggest taking a one way trip up if you really want to try out the cable car (for the sake of all K dramas and runningman) and then ride a bus down.
188,4.0,"We trekked the kids up Namsan one Sunday and loved it. The locals prefer to ride the cable car up and walk down for a Sunday afternoon which seemed much more civilized but we were going for the burn so we walked the whole thing.  Amazing views of the city all around. Two went up in the tower and liked it. We enjoyed Cold Stone Creamery ice cream while we admired the love locks around the plaza, and I loved the historic chimneys representing what was used to communicate between mountainsides in the old times. My son enjoyed the misting circle with the little kids on the plaza and we enjoyed a short rest at the temple up top. The street music was less than impressive but you get what you pay for! I have a friend who runs Namsan every morning, doable when there are no crowds and the humidity and smog haven't settled in yet. A must do for your Seoul bucket list!"
189,4.0,We took the cable to Namsan Park in order to visit the Seoul Tower.  Since if was a Saturday they was a rush and it took us a long time before we could get into the cable car.  The only draw back is that the no. of cable car is very less.  The scenery above is worth the wait.
190,4.0,"A place for everyone of every age group. Like most of the parks in South Korea, this park also has a open gym, place for cycling,skating and other required facilities."
191,4.0,"Go to the entrance of Namsan Tunnel No.3, and you will find a funicular that will take you to the base station of  the cable car. The funicular is short , only 1 min long, and free of charge. It's an easy and fun way to go uphill especially If you accompany small children and elderly. I didn't go up to the observatory tower because I found the ticket overpriced. Still, I could see the great view of Seoul and enjoyed strolling down the hill. You can also find many interesting places on the way downhill."
192,4.0,"From namsan tower, to walks in park to local restaruants...it was one of our favorite places to visit."
193,5.0,Namsan Park is a nicely made park in the hills over Itewon. Easy access even with a baby. The park is beutiful made with water and paths among flowers and beautiful trees. I was most suprised when I went to the toilet to see how clean a public toilet can be - That is not common in my home country.
194,5.0,Have tried the cable car and went to the Seoul Tower. The panoramic views of Seoul are just fantastic. My visit to the Alive Museum (adjacent to the Seoul Tower) was full of fun. A must-see attraction for visitors~
195,5.0,Good to have a short walk around the park! Some people prefer taking cable car to there and walk downwards to the town.  A nice and leisure walk in the city.
196,4.0,"There are couple locks trees and on fence for the love birds and photo taking spot. You need to do a bit of walking around the area, up hill after the cable car... a note for elder, need a good pair of walking shoe."
197,4.0,Must visit before sunset and you will be see the beautiful view from seoul especialy by night .Must visit the namsan tower
198,5.0,"When I was stationed here, 55 years ago, the only attraction up here was the statue of Syngman Rhee. Now, that statue has been relocated and the Seoul Tower has appeared. My son-in-law and I went up in the tower and took pictures for every angle. Although the landscape has changed tremendously in 55 years, some landmarks still exist. I'd recommend visiting this park if you're in Seoul."
199,5.0,"Namsan Park is a wonderful breakaway from the city of Seoul. However, this mountain and hiking route is in the middle of the city. It is so great to go their on a Saturday or Sunday morning and walk to the top. There are always some events or activities at the tower. If you don't want to walk, you can always use the cable car to the top."
200,5.0,"I've lived in Seoul for almost 3 years, and I never tire of Namsan Park, whatever the season.  We probably go to the park at least once a week, and sometimes more often.  Most tourists visit the park specifically for the purpose of visiting Seoul Tower at the top, but Namsan Park (which is built on Namsan Mountain) is much more than that! At the foot of the mountain, you can enter the park from many different places - I usually approach from the Itaewon area, near the Grand Hyatt.  If you're not a hiker, the park area at the base of the mountain offers some reasonably flat and beautifully landscaped strolling paths as well as a 'Children's Forest' playground, benches and gazebos, a stream and a pond.  A very nice break for tired kids who want to run and play! As with most attractions in Seoul, public restrooms are clean and plentiful, and well-marked. The landscaping is a mix of natural pine forest and landscaped beds, with stairs and viewing decks situated throughout. Namsan also has the distinction of being one of the parks in Seoul that permits dogs - not all of them do - and this is one of our dog's favorite strolls.  Even if you don't hike/walk/bus/cable car to the top, you can still get a nice view of Seoul from one of the lower observation decks, located throughout the park at the foot of the mountain.  You can reach the top of the mountain (and the tower plaza) via a series of stairs and hiking trails (steep!) which eventually feed out onto the road leading to the plaza.  At the top of Namsan, you can see some of the rebuilt city walls, as well as the replicas of the 16th(?) century stone fixtures in which signal fires were lit to warn of impending attack.  These are lit daily (except for Mondays) at noon, and include a ceremony (it's free.)  Also up at the plaza, you'll find convenience stores, public toilets, restaurants, and, of course, the Seoul Tower.  For a fee (about $10US) you can go to the top of the tower, which offers spectacular views of the city.  I've never eaten in the restaurant but have heard it's very good - and of course, the views cannot be beat! If you are traveling on a budget, the (free)views you will get from the observation deck at the base of the tower are also very good (although you may have to elbow through some tourists to find a good vantage spot for your photos.)  At the base of the tower, you will also find the fences covered with 'love locks' - locks fastened onto the fence by couples and friends professing undying love/friendship with notes written on them in various languages, similar to those you will find in many cities (London, Paris, Munich, as well as many others) throughout the world.  Bring your own lock or buy one (at an inflated price) at the store in the tower.  Namsan Park is beautiful during all seasons of the year - cherry blossoms in the spring, lush and shady in the summer, gorgeous foilage in the fall - and the winter is beautiful, too! It is sometimes hard to believe you are in one of the world's biggest, most crowded cities when you are hiking a peaceful trail through a pine forest.   We had a fantastic experience on Namsan in the falling snow on a New Year's Day morning, when we joined in with hundreds of others in the Korean tradition of welcoming in in the New Year by watching the sun rise at the top of the mountain (traditionally, people go to the Easternmost part of the country to see the very first rays of the sun, but many locals come to Namsan or one of the other mountains in Seoul.) Hiking clubs, civic groups, and families were there, along with local TV cameras, a DJ, and booths handing out free hot coffee and tea.  Namsan ('south mountain' used to be the marker of the southernmost border of Seoul, but today it is really more in the center of the city, and very close to its heart.  Whether you are a hiker, a fitness buff, a casual tourist, or a parent with kids who need to burn off some energy, Namsan Park is a lovely spot and a great choice for a vist."
201,4.0,"This park is something that makes tourists be able to have the time to relax, breathe in fresh cold air, roam around the park, with their food chains, desserts, sightseeing, and so on. Really nice for the family, for friends and for lovers, of course."
202,4.0,You must visit here when you go to Seoul. It's very fantastic. You can view the city from the tower location and also you can visit the park that very popular with the Lock.
203,5.0,"Spent a pleasant lunch time at Namsan Park. Didn't walk the whole way (actually, didn't walk at all since we took the cable car!) but we happened to catch the lovely cherry blossoms in full bloom at the top. They were also having a cultural show with smoke signals and one could also borrow for free a traditional dress (for both guys and girls) and take photos with them. Bought the couple package which included return cable car tickets a lunch at the Italian restaurant for 2. Not good value in my opinion."
204,4.0,"Go now! The cherry blossoms are in bloom.  Attractions at top are free.   You can walk to top, take a bus, or ride cable car.  This trip we road cable car one way up for 6,000w per adult, 3500w per child.  Cable car was nothing that great, but did offer views.  We then walked down the main exit road through beautiful cherry trees.  If you do this plan accordingly as the cable car and road don't end at same spot so you would need to figure out your transportation to and from at the bottom.  There is a good martial art and traditional show at 3PM that I recommend.  There is an early show that covers the lighting of the beacons but we missed it.  Great views if the fog and pollution are not a problem.  It was hazy the day we went so the view was not that great so plan for a clear day if you can.  There is a fee to go up the tower and for museum that looked like a trick eye museum, but we didn't go to them.  There is plenty of viewing areas without going up unless you really want to and it would be better if the sky is clear.  There are multiple trails you can go up by foot including the access roads but be aware it an be steep or involve many stairs.  Hurry as the cherry blossoms won't last and they were best along the access road as we walked down."
205,4.0,"I've been there with my family and the place is famous for placing locks with wishes and hopes being written on it. Most of the couples visit this place and of course friends and families. It's kinda an eye opener as there is a great view of the whole of Seoul. Both day and night are welcomed to visit! The locks are also for sale there if you need it. However, choices of food there are limited."
206,3.0,Namsun Park is quite a nice place to visit.  It has the Teddy Bear Museum and a good view of Seoul City.  Nice atmosphere.
207,5.0,"I enjoyed the climb up. The ride up the tower was reasonably priced, the observatory was not too crowded, and the view were excellent."
208,5.0,"One of the highlights in seoul is namsan park...we were able to cover many neighbouring attractions such as the namsangol village,seoul time capsule and also namsan tower.it was really worth it,the children enjoyed every bit ofthe trip"
209,5.0,This would be a must place to visit.  Take the subway and a short walk (but up hill) to the tram to take you to the top of the mountain.  A separate fee for the tram and to ride the elevator to the top of the tower.  Even from the base of the tower the views in every direction are of the beautiful and HUGE city or Seoul.  Great place for pictures.
210,4.0,Loved the walk up the hill as the scenery during autumn was beautiful. The only downside was the journey via bus as the driver was pretty reckless. Also a little too crowded. Better to go early in the morning on weekdays.
211,4.0,Namsan is easy trip by cable car or tour bus. A great spot for 360 degree view of Seoul. There were some traditional costumed soldiers doing marching around. You can go up to the top of tower (charge) and better view of the city.
212,5.0,"This park is extensive.  There are a wide number of walking /hiking/ or running trails that range around Namsan mountain.  Seoul Tower (also known as Namsan tower) is at the top of the mountain and provides excellent views to the surrounding area. Outside the tower is a very nice square with restaurants and small shops, as well as an area where they do performances and a large pavilion you can stop to eat lunch at.  The whole park is great for pictures!  With multiple trails there are always new things to see.  There are also large sections of the original fortress walls still in existence, and they have one area where they still do changing of the guard on the watch-fires during the summer.  There are sometimes cultural ambassadors up near the watch-fires with costumes that tourists can try on of the traditional clothing too!  My kids absolutely loved this.  The walk up the mountain can be steep, but there are also the trams and the city bus tour that get pretty close to the top if you don't want to walk all the way up.  A great chance to see a bit of history as well as a bit of the modern world, and to enjoy nature!"

214,5.0,We went to N-tower one late evening in June of 2013. We were lucky to arrive so late that the wait at the cable car was less than 10 minutes.At the tower we got to admire and take in the wonderful view of Seoul at night-time. It was so beautiful and lovely to just walk around and have your picture taken with Seoul in the background. It was also cool to see all the couples' padlocks placed on the fence of the tower.The ride back down with the cablecar gave us a great view of Seoul as well. Highly recommend you go here if you visit Seoul.
215,3.0,"You can visit Namsan Park for free.To go to Namsan Park, you can walk or take cable car. I choose to take cable car. At Namsan Park, you can visit Seoul Tower and teddy Bear Museum. Your kids will enjoy the Teddy Bear Museum. Trust me.From the Seoul Tower, you can view the whole city from the observation deck.The view at this place was really lovely."
216,4.0,"park is excellent, but there's too many stairs with no elevators which makes going around with baby on stroller a bit tiring and difficult."
217,4.0,"The view is excellent and the park was relaxing and a good hang out place. It has some cool stuff, such as a display of trees plastered with locks for which you can write you wish on a piece of plaque and ""lock"" it up on the tree.  The park also has the Teddy Bear Museum, which was average and it has 2 sections to it.  The museum was pretty empty so I guess everyone else was too busy visiting the N-Tower.  The cable car was a nice ride and the line up was short on the day we went (we visited on a week day).  If you are walking to the cable car station, make sure you take the ""glass"" evelator which takes up up the the hill from the street. On the day we went, it was closed so we had to walk up the hill and many stairs to get to the station. However, by the time we came back, it was operating again so we took it down stream."
218,4.0,"Took Gondola up to the summit of Nasam Park.  Going up, good views of city from left of gondola on way up.  They pack in 15-20 people, so positioning in Gondola on correct side is important to get a good view.  At the top, impressive smoke signal from 14c/15c to warn of oncoming attackers.  Did not go up tower as it was quite hazy.  Got to try on ancient costumes and take pictures, not sure if this is regular."
219,4.0,"We were lucky that the day we went, the weather is beautiful and everything simply looks for for picture taking. We were there with kids, who at first complained abt climbing the steps to reach the park and but started running abt and exploring every locks that is tied to the fences. Even my hubby and I could not resist and have to take a kwiyomi post in the unique bended bench! Nice!"
220,5.0,"good work out, we loved the views,  more than you think, got to see the lovers locks and the teddy bear museums, enjoyable"
221,5.0,"I have been there several time, and it is different every time. Once I managed to see an excellent street performance - the music band from South America I guess. It was great! Another time - it was a dancing show, which was nice too. It worth visiting!"
222,5.0,"Took the short cable car ride leading up to the park. The view was great although it would have been better had it not been people-packed. Not a good idea to visit the park on a Saturday, I guess. Hied of to N-Grill for lunch-- the revolving restaurant that's on the highest floor of the tower. It was worth the price-- spectacular views with great modern-French food. Good selection of fine wines too, that surprisingly are reasonably priced. Rode the cable car going down-- although a hike would have been more fun and scenic."
223,5.0,"We went through the park twice on our visit.  There is the N-tower, parts of old fortress walls, the love locks, and the cable car at the top, which are all neat to visit (but beware there is a fee for the tower and the cable car).  The park also offers tons of hiking trails that go to various site in the park (old style village, etc).  There are also tennis courts and outdoor work out areas located on these trails.  It is fun to hike but be sure to bring a map!  It is very easy to get misdirected and the trails can be long.  Also bring water in summertime since it can get very hot and humid."
224,3.0,"Again, not accessible. Had a stroller and got tired lugging it on the steps. Rode the cable car and yet it was far from the top."
225,4.0,We went to the park on April 22st It was a warm day (16C) it was spectacular my son really enjoyed the walk down. Unfortunately we didn't use the Cable car(I am told is was fabulous) The path is well arranged and properly sign posted. You really get the entire view of the city and the region on the top You really need not go the tower. If I had some more time I would have visited again. If you are in Seoul please don't miss this walk.
226,5.0,"We went twice -- once, a week before the cherry trees bloomed and ten again when the trees throughout Seoul were in bloom. The view was breathtaking and because it was spring on a weekday, no major crowds to deal with."
227,5.0,Very pretty.  Always people there.  Shows Koreans love their green space.   Many trees and flowers.  Great track for running
228,5.0,"Since I went in April the weather was still not great and it was much colder at the top.  The views from Namsan are stunning and if you really want to, you can hike all the way up instead of taking the cable car."
229,4.0,"Took a tram up and down.  Nice views of the city.  You can really appreciate the city sprawl from the top.  The tram was a bit crowded and uncomfortable.  We watched a cultural show at the top that lasted about an hour.  They had a games display, a marshall arts display and dance display.   It was well done.   The  collection of locks is neat to look at too!"
230,5.0,It has nice view of Seoul and during winter the scenery is spectacular. Took the cable car up if you have kids for a relaxing climb instead of walking up. Very cold though but OK
231,4.0,"We strolling at Namsan Park before going to Seoul Tower.The trees are yellow and red in color during autumn season.The air was so refreshing.Some old folks also came out for exercising.I like the very ""unique"" restroom inside the park."
232,5.0,"On our first day / night in Seoul, we spend our time in Namsan Park / Namsan tower. Since we arrived in the afternoon and our guest house is near, we decided to go here first. We walked from Namsan Guest and took the Namsan Cable car. When we got off the cable car, our first impression was WOW! It was cold at that time but it is so refreshing. I like the autumn color of the park. A good place to rest and to play. When we went down from Namsan tower it was already dark. A lot of people were there to stroll and to spend the very nice cold weather of the park. Over all, very nice!"
233,4.0,"Thousand of locks, teddy bear Museum, bird's eye view of Seoul, cable car rides. Nice place to visit and chill out, have coffee with a loved one."
234,5.0,"I really wanted to see this place because of my favorite Koreanovela ""Boys over flowers"". Going there really satisfied my obsession in their shoot locations... I love this place... It was also our first snow experience :-)"
235,5.0,"We took a taxi to Namsan Cable Car station (if not, there are free shuttle buses from some subway stations too), and took a cable car to Namsan Park. It offers amazing and gorgeous views of Seoul. When we came down from the park, there were helpful staff asking us where we were heading to. Apparently, there is a free shuttle bus to Myeongdong subway station."
236,4.0,"took the cable car up to the tower.  Great view.  Had dinner up on the tower.  It's a great date location.  The restaurant had these two seater couches all facing out the window.  Perfectly private dinner setting.  But I was with a group of people and we got one of the tall big tables, still an awesome view. It's a great place to walk around and get a view of the city.  We walked down the mountain.  Long walk but if you are wearing comfortable shoes, it's a real nice stroll with place to sit along the way."
237,4.0,This park like any other park in Seoul is really clean.It's safe to stroll and enjoy the scenery amidst falling leaves in Autumn.
238,4.0,There are a few different ways to get up to the tower through the park but I took what felt like the world's longest flight of stairs. It was a great workout and definitely worth it. When you get to the top you can see all of Seoul. It's nice.
239,4.0,We were really surprised how lovely this was.  We had shopped ourself silly and were ready for some time out and this was just right.  A place of solace in the madness that is Seoul!
240,5.0,"We live close to Namsan, and are so thankful that we have such a great place to get our green fix in a city where that is hard to come by.  The hike to the top is somewhat of an exertion, but well worth it for the view.  The restaurant right oat the bottom of the tower (The Place) has great views and is much more affordable than up at the top.  At the base of Namsan, near the Hyatt, there are many beautiful walks to choose from."
241,4.0,"Nice walk to reach the tower, it is very fresh and clean.  There is a teddy bear museum where my little daughter's very happy visiting there. Go and see, you won't forget that place."
242,4.0,"Great outing to get away from the busy city life. The walk up is a good workout if you are in need of some exercise on your trip, there is also a cable car that takes you to the tower at the top. There are restaurants and snack bars in the tower complex. Well worth a visit when in Seoul"
243,5.0,"It's just across the stree from the Banyan Tree Hotel. Huge park for walking, running and have rest from the city. There are no cafe inside, just on the hill, near N Tower Seoul, so take water with you."
244,5.0,"nice relaxing area for some leisure time, relax to enjoy the scenic park view, refreshing air."
