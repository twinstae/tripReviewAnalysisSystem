0,4.0,My son is a lifelong devotee of Kimchi. We absolutely had to visit this museum. (Who would guess there would be a museum devoted exclusively to Kimchi? But there is in Seoul!) Very interesting with several activities for children to participate in. There is even a large kitchen where they offer Kimchi making courses for children and adults. So many displays and information throughout the museum about the history of this unique dish and also shows how it has impacted the world. Excellent visit for people who love Kimchi. And very enlightening for those of us who would rather not eat it but are accompanying our children who had this as their #1 attraction in Seoul!

It also became one of the world's top 11 food museums in March 2015 when it got selected by CNN.Kimchikan is located in Insadong near Ssamzigil and its located on the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors of the Insa-dong Maru building.The entrance fee is 5,000 won for adults, 3,000 won for students and 2,000 won for children (under 8yo). The audio guide is included in the price of the ticket.You can only avail of the audio guide as long as you have your ID with you. You can also try the hanbok for free and wear it inside the museum if you wish to do so. At the museum visitors will learn how kimchi is made, the various types that there are and its health benefits. The museum also has kimchi making classes for those who would like to learn how to do it themselves.On the ground floor you have interactive activities and even a section where you can try hanbok and take photos. One of the walls is used as a screen for a kimchi documentary. You will also see lots of cookware used to make and store kimchi.On the 4th floor you have a small gift shop and a coffee shop.

They also have recipes about how to make the type of kimchi you tasted. You just have to chose the one you liked the most.The 6th floor is where you will find the kimchi classes. For a fee you can learn how to make kimchi and even take it with you. There is also a section where you can stamp your postcards with kimchi related stamps.The museum is open from 10h to 18h (Last admission 17:30).When you visit Korea, if you pay attention to the residential areas (rooftops or balconies for example) you will notice the earthenware pots. Its not a decorative item. Its where they keep their kimchi.Kimchi Festivals:If you visit Korea during the first week of November go visit their Kimchi Festival in Seoul. Or Gwangju World Kimchi Culture Festival during May, September and November."

You can also sign up kimchi making experience on the spot, but better to reserve. Free Hanbok Experience, as with many other museums in Korea."
4,5.0,We had so much fun making Kimchi at the museum and the kids did too! They gave us an English translator and the instructions were clear and thorough. The kids were able to participate at only 6 years old and they provided kids sized aprons and gloves / cutting tools for them. Included in the price was our own container to take home our Kimchi. The facilities were clean and modern and we will defiantly do this again!
5,5.0,"Okay, I love food museums and this one is very well done and clearly had money put into it with hands on touch screens, excellent short documentaries with elders talking about different types of kimchi they grew up with, and tastings. It isn't a long visit but it was not expensive either and it will change how you view the different kimchi that is put on the table in front of you. I think it is a must visit."
6,3.0,Visited this museum dedicated to kimchi and had a good time. Lot's of interesting information and actually interactive displays that my five year old enjoyed. The reason that I am giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because I was expecting the kimchi tasting room to be a bit more extensive than it was.
7,3.0,"This museum was in the Mall and easy walking distance from our hotel room at the Coex. Since it was so inexpensive we decided we would check it out. There were lots of displays and information about kimchi and it's history. How kimchi is healthy and how it's different in each part of the country. We learn what ingredients are found in different kimchis and near the end was a sampling area with about 7 different types.It was a fast visit, under an hour, but I am still glad we visited this small museum devoted to kimchi."
8,1.0,"We went to the COEX looking for the Kimchi Museum and could not find it.  We went to some of the stores to ask if we were in the right part of the facility and were told that the museum had closed.  If this place is still in operation, they hide it well."
9,5.0,"The Kimchi Museum is great! Located in a hole in the ground at the mall, it isn't too hard to find since you just go towards the aquarium most of the time. The museum is small, but there is a lot of really interesting information there, and you get to taste different types of kimchi! They also have some of the traditional Korean hats (men and women) so there are some cute photo ops there."
