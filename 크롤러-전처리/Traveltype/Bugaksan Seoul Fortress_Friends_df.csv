It's not high, but has a great view of Seoul city. The remnants of the fortress allows you to take nice pictures too. However, sunset does not look too good on the hill..If you want, you can walk towards Sindang. You'll come across the mural village that was featured in Running Man (the one where they kicked their shoes up the stairs).It is a far walk though."
1,4.0,"I love how central it was located in Seoul, yet it felt so secluded with the fact that there was not much crowd visiting the place compared to other hills/mountains in Seoul. This is a place that I would go again if I live in Seoul and looking for a hill to have a short and easy hike. The hill had wonderful view of the city, whereby Seoulâ€™s main attractions like the major palaces can be seen from the hill. During the hiking, we bumped into the South Korean armies but it did not give us any uncomfortable feeling. There were some areas whereby we were forbidden from taking photos, but they were not clearly marked. Other than that, just be reminded that it closes on Mondays."

Get off at the stop called Waryong Park (which seemed more like the back gate of Sungkyunkwan Uni and nowhere like a park) and walk up slope along the road until you really reach Waryong Park.Malbawi Information Centre is still ~30mins walk away from Waryong Park. There, you will need to fill up a form and register using your passport. After which, a tag will be passed to you which you will have to wear for the rest of the hike until you reach Changuimun. The information centre also have toilet facilities and you can fill up on water too.There seemed to be a few side trails but as a rule of thumb, we just followed the fortress wall. The down side of this is that part of the view is blocked by the wall. In addition, photo-taking is not allowed for some places (generally in the direction of the Blue House), and there are guards along every few metres to ensure that. However, you still can catch a good view of Seoul city.The trail comprises of ascends and descends until the peak at Baekakmaru and where the view is not to be missed. The real descend comes after Baekakmaru and is done by walking down stairs and more stairs until Changuimun. I was glad I did not start the route from Changuimun gate. There are simply too many stairs to climb. To get to metro station from Changuimun Gate, follow the sign to Gyeongbokgung until you reach the main road, cross the road and take bus 7022 or 7212 to Gyeongbokgung Station.Will recommend to do the hike towards the end of your vacation in Seoul as my calf muscles were aching for the next few days from walking all that stairs."
3,4.0,"Lots of stairs and uphill walking--so be prepared for that before you go by wearing good shoes and appropriate attire. You will need your passport to get in, but it isn't a hassle at all to check into the area. There were a lot of places you couldn't take pictures--some were not marked well. If we weren't sure, we would just ask the guard standing nearest to us. They were very pleasant and didn't seem to mind."
4,5.0,"Beautiful view. You must go because photos are restricted, and you won't be able to experience the beauty through viewing those photos uploaded onto the internet. Bring your passport, wear comfortable clothes (best not to wear jeans and dresses/skirts) and a good pair of walking/hiking shoes. Depending on the route you take, it might be useful for you to bring a hiking pole as a certain section of the trek would be rather steep. Try not to plan another activity into the same day so that you can spend as much time here as possible. Likewise, don't bring too many things with you in your bag, you will definitely regret halfway through the journey. Trust me, you won't need those things at all. No need for coats, scarfs etc in autumn, the exercise will warm you up. You can go with your friends, family, or alone. Not for those travelling with young children because the steps are tall."
