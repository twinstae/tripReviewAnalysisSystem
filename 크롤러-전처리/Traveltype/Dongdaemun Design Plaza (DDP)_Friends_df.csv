0,4.0,"I went there two times, AM and PM. The night scenery is so beautiful. So many places to take photos. Outside the building, there are roses being displayed (actually for kdrama shooting, but somehow they left it there as it become famous with tourists). I would like to recommed coming here during the night."
1,4.0,Nice place to just sit by the steps and enjoy the cold. Great for taking pictures as well. Occasionally they have exhibitions here but unfortunately when we went it was already over.
2,5.0,Such a beautiful place to take picture. The building design are unique and beautiful. You can enter the underground and enjoy your shopping.
3,5.0,"I love this area! It’s such a treat for my eyes every time I see DDP.  Such a beautiful architectural design that has to be seen in person as photos don’t do it justice. Also the shopping here is very good, the business hours of the shopping centers is staggered so it offers shopping pretty much 24 hours. I prefer this area over Myeongdong, although it’s also crowded it’s more “open” with the shopping centers vs outdoor shopping streets."
4,4.0,"Seoul - a city of 24 hour fried chicken, beer and shoju with ladies shopping non stop till 5 am in 8-9 Stories malls of shops including basement shopping. Important note to Seoul :- Come with empty luggage as you don’t need clothes, masks or cosmetics ! You can shop till you are broke. Always bring cash in Won or $$. Tips for shopaholic: - Remember you can always go back to hotel to  shower and re-consider that dress and go back to the mall at 3 am to buy and then celebrate the great achievements of full luggage and extra luggage and then have a late supper of fried chicken with beer after.Most important- Download Naver map as Google map don’t work in Seoul !"
5,3.0,"Interesting building but inside there was a huge hall with many unusual chairs which I suppose were interesting but not particularly inspiring. The interior is worn and in need of renovation, all in all it seemed like a bit of a white elephant"
6,4.0,"This building has a very cool architecture style and for those who love photography, you can also have a photo hunting day here in DDP."
7,4.0,I like the design of the building - inside and outside. There is coffee area as well. Love the design!
8,5.0,"Good place to visit, chill and can be a nice place to explore. Recommend for people who interest in any event or designs. Flee market and food trucks available sometimes. Nice and creative architecture. Place to visit for designs and creative goods seeking. Temporary events rotate periodically. As time of my visit, there are many interesting events such as Hello Paul Smith and The Art of Disney The Magic of Animation. Flee market and food trucks in the evening as well. More spaces to walk around and chill out. Easy to access with many public transportations.Idea to visit if you have spare time."
9,5.0,Dongdaemon Design Plaza has a modern architecture. It's about 19 mins walk from train station. It's a must visit place.
10,4.0,"When we visited, it was really cold, but there were still so many people around. There weren't that many food stalls opened as we had hoped for, but there was a piano there that we enjoyed playing."
11,5.0,"Generally Seoul has not fine architecturel profile.. but this DDP is well aesthetic huge building.. I experienced and felt touching, watching, listening a functional sculpture..a little bit in some where of the DDP I lost or confused about the horizon.. I advice at least two hours to spent in there.."
12,4.0,"Spectacular 3D architecture design! Impressive concept! Worth a visit. Beautiful from inside & outside for photos. There was a change of new lease for the shops, so we didn’t get to see many shops on that day. Shops were being refurbished."
13,5.0,"Fashion district and the design of the buildings were very modern and state-of-the-art, indeed! There were also nearby malls and night market."
14,4.0,The design plaza is so unique with futuristic exterior. Inside it likes a maze. Without direction information it’s hard to find the right way. Somehow busy due to the fashion week.
15,4.0,I think this place is a worthwhile place to visit while in Seoul.  The building is nothing like I’ve seen before.  Easy access via subway
16,5.0,"Located in a Seoul-style block, dongdaemun design plaza is a extremely strange but spectacular construction. Just like zaha always did, she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul.I always like zaha’s design and think it very cool to take photo here. You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here.If you hope to take some pure architecture photos, I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP. There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night. In contrast, there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views."
17,4.0,"Nice building, there are various shops / restaurants/ galleries inside. I took the chance to visit a korean art exposition. It is a good way to spend a couple hours"
18,5.0,"This museum is both stunning yet totally accessible in terms of bringing good design to all echelons of public and taste. It is also situated in a fantastic area of shopping, architecture and leisure. Allow several hours to visit the area or stay in one of many nearby hotels."
19,4.0,the architecture is amazing. best time to visit is evening so that you can see the lights & reflections over the huge building. there are some exhibition halls inside the building. an iconic land mark of Seoul. highly recommended.
20,1.0,"It’s a beautiful building and you should visit if you are a champion of significant architecture.  If you love art, you will be shattered with disappointment.  There is no art here.  Changing exhibitions means that all galleries were closed.   Buildings designed to be galleries have been turned into job fairs, malls and food courts.  It’s pathetic that a civic project has been allowed to be so misaligned with the original intent."
21,5.0,This is a great place to shop for unique gifts and souvenirs. We did the majority of our Christmas shopping here.
22,1.0,Remember : on Monday they closed!!! No one told me even this TripAdvisor that DDP is closed every Monday... we took far away travel to DDP from Gangnam-gu after myeongdong by train but when we are here is closed... only design market is open... lost our time!!!
23,3.0,"The design of the building is unique and there’s spiral staircase within. First floor showcases designer clothes, bags. There’s a design museum. It is basically a place that shows designers’ stuff."
24,5.0,Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a well known architecture and unique structure in Seoul. Better be here and be amaze!
25,4.0,"When around late afternoon, you cannot miss that landmark. Got a mix feeling about the place.... got shops and quite confusing for me. The lights display/design has dimmed (when I was there) and not as impressive as initially thoughts but still acceptable view at night. Use your imagination and photo app ;-)"
26,5.0,"I didn't have any expectation going there, but it smacked me right in the face I am glad we went there. it fulfils its role as design centre, there are museum, halls, marketplace for budding artists and also shopping/eating centre in one place, making it a one-stop destination for everyone. you can definitely have great pictures in the building's premise, just find angles that you like. favorite photo spot is the stairs."
27,5.0,It was fun in there and the epic designs of structures are superb! Definitely an instagram-worthy place! Spend the afternoon there while waiting for our flight back to our country and it was the right decision!
28,5.0,Beautiful. Hard to find the entrance. Great outdoor space as well. The area has shopping and food. Make sure to look for the rose garden.
29,4.0,"Great location,and everything looks new, suitable for girls' stay. Easy going to all major points with metro or taxi, and many good food choices around. Definitely will choose it again."
30,5.0,"Sculptures were fascinating and architecture amazing, definitely worth a walk around and spend some time relaxing with a coffee"
31,5.0,"It is a very interesting building, especially for someone who loves to take architecture pictures ! There is a small russian district nearby."
32,4.0,"I'm not much into artworks but my sister really wanted to go so we headed over. From the outside it is stunning, with a couple of lovely statues, and inside is pretty cool too - though not as much to see as I thought there would be. A few of the areas were pretty enjoyable to look at, and I enjoyed the design plaza with all the different shops - lots of cute little items for sale."
33,5.0,"The architecture is beautiful and very futuristic looking.  There are a bunch of shops inside, The second time I came here (in 2015 I think), there was some type of event going on outside with a stage set up and some music artists were performing.  It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening.  It definitely seemed like things were still being set up.  The subway stops right at the DDP, so it's convenient to get to via subway.  You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore.  It's also close to Doota and other shopping areas right across the street so expect to spend a few hours in this area if you want to go shopping."
34,4.0,We went there primarily to shop nearby and took a coffee break inside one of the cafes.  The structure is really impressive for the architecture and good for photos.  It is also a subway stop so it's handy to exit here and look around this shopping neighborhood.
35,5.0,"Actually I didn't take many events there. When I was there, there were some special exhibition or shows, but  I didn't have enough time, so I can't enjoy them. But I looked around design shops and design museum there, and it was great experience."
36,3.0,"Happy I've seen it, architecture alone is breathtaking. But nothing else. It's just a fancy mall. Come if you want to drop your kids to a playground, come for food trucks and coffee shops, come for cheap memorabilia shopping. You won't find here anything you may not find elsewhere in Seoul's markets. Set your expectations straight, you'll have a great time. Come for design, art, modernism, you'll leave craving for more."
37,5.0,"This is a very artsy place where designers or architects would love it. Even so, do come and take a quick visit before heading over to Dongdaemun for your shopping. There are many exhibits which are quite interesting to see and you can chill at the rooftop grass field."
38,3.0,"A very artistic and modern plaza where local youngsters love to hang around. There are special labs for art students, seminar rooms, auditorium and a library. On certain days, there performance for budding young people to show cast their talents (singing, dancing) as well as flea markets selling their handicrafts from jewelries to caricature. It is situated right opposite the Dongdaemun shopping district. If you happen to be in the area, do take a stroll in the plaza to have the feel of arts."
39,5.0,The place itself it’s amazing and the expositions inside are changing constantly and very interesting. We were there for the Fashion week and the location fitting amazingly with the event. One of my favorite places of the area. The surroundings have a lot of cool places to visit too
40,4.0,"I can't forget the view that welcomed me to this mall, so many LED roses bulbs all aglow! Good thing we went there at night. Plus weather right now is good, spring season, not too cold and not too hot. Plus, I was so ecstatic when I saw the area where my favorite Kpop group performed a dance (Highlight boy band) last year! ❤️💕 woohoo!!!"
41,5.0,"In awe of the architectural structure. it's designed by Late Starchitect Zaha Hadid. It's a must visit, mostly for the architecture. Their Archive cafe is also very nice, with really good breads and hot chocolate."
42,4.0,Interesting art pieces around the plaza.  Inside is a museum with special exhibits at times.  Right outside is the Seoul City Tour double decker bus which you can buy a ticket for to enjoy sites around the area.
43,2.0,"This is exotic and nice building, for sure. Made several shots of it. But inside... I was expecting something unusual inside as well, however there's only food and shops. Sometimes exhibitions."
44,5.0,"This amazing building has to be seen to be appreciated. Go to the top floor and out to see the ""green roof"", walk up and down the stairs, explore the inside. There are many small shops selling design goods and souveniers, and cafes as well."
45,4.0,"Not really a big attraction, but it does have dining options and a interesting area for photos at night. The LED rose garden is worth seeing at night without it being too crowded. It is tucked away in the back of the building with stone walls surrounding making for architecturally intriguing photos. When Seoul Fashion Week is held here it is great place for people watching."
46,5.0,"A beautifully constructed building, great place to go at night & take pictures. Coffee shops inside."
47,5.0,"I took lots of pictures here. It is so futuristic feel...huge and wide buildings. If you love stationery, there is a Monami concept stall where sells nice quality pens which i feel is a good souvenirs to friends or relatives. Not to mention it is a Korean brand."
48,5.0,"A must see in Seoul, especially at night. Very impressive architecture by late Zaha Hadid, she was an Iraqi-British architect. Looks like an U.F.O. has landed. Has a lot of interesting design shops inside"
49,4.0,We walked through a big modern coffee shop gate A3 inside the DDP and out into the led rose light garden which was outdoor .During night time it was brilliant the glowing rose flower lights shine bright and lovely filled the gardens in DDP .
50,5.0,"I can say we were lucky because in our everyday itinerary we need to pass by in Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The modern, amazing architecture is simply picture perfect. We had the opportunity to view this beautiful architectural work both day and night. This is near Dongdaemun shopping district/market. It is worth your time to visit if you happen to be in Seoul."
51,5.0,"There's a rose lampions (?) near the gate and people definetly came here to take a picture with that. it was so beautiful tho. Inside the Plaza we can buy souvenirs, the place was so huuugee and incredible. there's also a lot of restaurants and stores nearby."
52,3.0,Definitely an area that appeals to people who like shopping. Lots of shops and bargains to be had. Metro nearby.
53,4.0,I was there in the night. Not really sure what to see except the fake roses field. The roses are so beautiful in the dark!
54,5.0,The exterior of the building is absolutely striking and the interior is just as fascinating. The current exhibition looks neat but it seemed a bit pricey and small. It is an interesting place to visit if you like taking pictures and it's a place that you are going to like it or hate it.
55,4.0,"Newest landmark connected to the subway and history and culture park station. There are some building artitechure statues. There is a park way. Near by are shopping malls, street market and seoul city wall and museum"
56,5.0,"Very beautiful building, very strategic place. There are so many shopping centers around the building. The night view is amazing, there are so many shop inside the building but the price is rather high compare to other store. This place is accessible though the metro. A must see place in Seoul. If you going for a shopping, I recommend you to visit Doota just next to the building, The gift shop there are cheap."
57,4.0,"Subway can reach. Very convenience. You can shoot some nice photos there. Other than that, nothing much inside. It sell alot designer product."
58,4.0,Worth a train ride just to see it's enormous structure.  There's some shopping stalls inside but a expensive.
59,4.0,"Love the designs by zaha hadid architects so went to visit DDP in Seoul. Night view is just amazing, must see, there are some shops inside and also museums."
60,5.0,You'll probably bypass this location. You're loss. So many free items to enjoy. There are different types of things to experience.
61,5.0,I couldn’t help but think of the Sydney Opera House and the Sagrada Familia when I walked around this structure and marvel at the what we can do today with the help of modern engineering and technology.
62,5.0,"As a student of architecture, and I especially liked the unique architecture of this work. It was created by Zaha Hadid, a great architect !! I really admire! Architectural exterior as well as inner space is extremely great! Inside the building is a shopping area with art shop , and an art exhibition placeBehind, have a rose garden are combined with light creating a space like heaven! 😍😍😍"
63,5.0,"I went to this exhibit, which is mainly housed at the DDP and was wowed.  First, the architecture of the building itself is really very unique, with its undulating curves and color.  Very futuristic and stylish.  Then the main attraction was the exhibit, which was incredible.  It was very obvious that a lot of work went into perfecting it and I really appreciated it.  It was so full of information, that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge.  We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves.  She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions.  Even that took some time.  The tour may be enough for some people, but those who really want to delve into the exhibit can return and use the tour guide as a roadmap for tackling everything.  The other part of the exhibit was located in Donuimun Museum Village and we went there as well.  They really complemented each other very well.  Well worth a day trip and a return visit, time allowing."
64,4.0,We went to this shop twice as it had so many interesting items made by students in the design school.  Most were a little pricey but good to see the creativity that went into the final products.
65,4.0,The Design centre has several exhibition floors where you can find both local and overseas designers with their innovative art products. Some are of artistic value while others are product of daily use. Some special exhibitions are free of charge on Eednesday. The souvenir shop on ground floor features a lot of innovative gadgets. Worth a half day visit.
66,3.0,My fav building in seoulBeautiful landscapes and architecture designs in n outWorth a visit while u r here
67,5.0,t must go there. A magnificient design. Like a museum but it's more than that. Should visit on Saturday's night. They have a garden of neon roses. So great.
68,5.0,it's an architectural master piece in my eyes. Never seen something like this anywhere. I love the night market and truck food. LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough.  Head to 'Dongdaemun history and cultural park' station for direct access. 'Dongdaemun' station is next station and you might need to walk back to reach there. Outside of DDP there are lots of shop and the famous Migilore and Doosan shops.Eat n shop
69,5.0,this place is very big and so many tourist. its not even a problem here. maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside. we bought some souvenir at the road down there. and the street food look really tempting. yall really should try that.
70,5.0,The architecture is simply amazing and mind blowing!There's a lot of space to sit around for a picnic so I suggest getting some beer and chips from a convenience stall and sitting down on the many small alfresco dining areas or the grass hill!
71,5.0,"I am in awe of this building! It has got to be one of the coolest Zaha Hadid buildings. Definitely worth checking out at night, when the electric rose gardens are lit and the building lights up with changing lights - it makes the whole complex look like this futuristic organism. Absolutely worth seeing in person - photographs can't do something of this scale justice. Inside there are lots of galleries and exhibits. I didn't get to pop into them, but my Korean friends raved about them."
72,5.0,"This place holds various exhibitions and fashion shows, so it really depends on personal preference. The last time I went was during its exhibition. Quite a nice view except that the pictures didn't turn out good on my phone. This is located at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (Seoul Subway Line 2, 4 ,5) and Exit 1."
73,4.0,Interesting building with exhibits. Lots of shopping nearby and there is a subway station at the plaza.
74,5.0,"Best to visit in the evening with changing and throbbing lights and all! We did not bother entering as we were so tired from a day's tour, we just posed and took some selfies. Next time, we'll check the schedule of events."
75,4.0,The DDP is good for photoshooting and you can easily get an instagram-worthy picture here.I went there at night and the DDP is just look like a UFO stations at Seoul city. The lights on the DDP blinks slowly at night. You can take a walk around DDP and enjoy the night view of Dongdaemun.
76,3.0,"The building is it-self interesting to visit. Small museum shop, some shopping area. Good to take a coffee at the garden or at the terrace."
77,5.0,This place is great to just wander around and explore. The architecture is magnificent and lots of good photo opportunities. There are also several picnic spots. You can also visit the museums and exhibitions inside for a price.Very good for dates or if you're tired of shopping in Dongdaemun.
78,5.0,Highly futuristic architectural design and awesome place. A must visit when in Seoul as it will leave a lasting memory for sure.
79,5.0,"I have never seen anything like it. From the outside it looks like a complex stadium or maybe even a spaceship. Inside the spectacular designs continue with elaborate archways and fancy lighting. There is so much to see and do here from shopping to eating. I have visited this place twice, mainly because my camera loves it here. Make sure to put this one on your list if you are visiting Seoul."
80,4.0,"DDP is very attractive building with beautiful lightnings at night. It's a nice place to walk around, don't miss the artificial rose garden."
81,4.0,It's a nice place to sit down and take a break from the shopping. There is also a huge atrium inside where they sell many interesting household decorative stuffs. The prices are very reasonable.
82,3.0,Happen to visit this area and still has some time. Decide to walk over to take a look of this Silver Dome. This is unique structure by itself in this tall buildings area.It is ready huge building and think is the same idea as The Arc in Daegue.
83,3.0,"I came here for the DDP night market. The night market closes quite early. My friends and i arrive there around 12 at night and almost shops are closed. We didnt eat anything there. Luckily we took some picture with the LED roses for 5 minutes. Lights turned of very soon.Most importantly, the MRT was no longer providing service since it is too late, all the taxis are not willing to follow the meter. (a lot of taxi were waiting outside Doota but none of them willing took us) Lastly, I spent 20,000W to Mapo-gu, which is 50% off already. Remember to bargin the price or leave before 12 am.This problem is the same in this district, we didnt take the taxi in crowded area..."
84,5.0,"I didn't get to go in but did enjoy this massive architecture from the outside. I went up a department store to the 10th floor, and got a bird's eye view of it, the building has a balcony. See photo."
85,4.0,"New landmark of Seoul, it was nice to be there really cool building. DDP is the place for Seoul Fashion Week if you want to know that feeling being an model just go there and take some photos lol but inside the building you can find souvenir that very unique and cool desiged from young designer or famous designer of korea also you walk aroung DDP you gonna see LE Roses garden recommend to visit there at night really beautiful"
86,4.0,a super cool architectural building! there are also lots of events you can visit inside. Don't forget to visit the LED rose garden on day and night. It's super beautiful
87,3.0,"I've never been in the museum side, but the design plaza is a unique little shopping area. I've bought some interesting things in here before, and it might be worth a look around, but I think if you are visiting Seoul that there are much more interesting and better places to go."
88,4.0,"Sweeping design, contemporary lines, open interior . . . a building that draws and maintains your attention as you explore its exterior and interior.  Rooftop garden, angular spiraled stairwell, and more.  The changing exhibitions inside vary from inspired to insipid.  (I've been here four times over a four-year time period.)"
89,3.0,Interesting architecture with interesting sculptures scattered throughout the vicinity. It was a nice surprise to find out that DDP sits on top of an archaeological site so there were some artifacts that you can view together with modern ones.
90,4.0,"The DDP really is a wonderful piece of architecture and as a Zaha Hadid fan was a must on my to do list.Would highly recommend visiting at night as the whole place is illuminated and the lights sort of bounce of the building, it really is beautiful and you can really appreciate the curvature of the design. A plus with visiting at night is the flower light garden which is a fun walk and great photo opp - very romantic for date night!If you're heading the day, chill with a drink int he middle and listen to people play on the piano, check out lots of sculptures around the plaza or make a 3D model toy of yourselves - would recommend you go early in your trip for this.DDP was one of my favourite nights in Seoul and as a bonus you can walk across the road to Dongdaemun Market and Doota for 24hr shopping to make the most out of the night."
91,5.0,"Oh yes! This is a good place for street photography, snack time, dating time and much more! Good and clothes store everywhere and you will be going home a a bunch a hand. Love it!"

93,5.0,"This place is good for taking pictures. If you need a place to take a picture with an incredible background, this is the perfect place for you. Especially during Seoul fashion week, you can meet many attractive and fashionable models. Sometimes, there will be events here such as flea market and performance. There's also a lot of museum here and stores. The stores here are relatively expensive than other places."
94,5.0,"I visited this place with my sister who is an architect. As an ordinary people who came as a tourist, I found this place was really cool and had many sides you can take picture and enjoy the view. As for my sister, she really enjoyed her time admiring this building and its curvy design. This place is really sophisticated but beautiful."
95,5.0,"Loved the lit LED roses, thousands of them. And the shops inside offers unique souvenir items that you can bring home with you."
96,4.0,Its unique design is an attraction. It's nice to walk around the structure to appreciate the landscape at the other side of the building. Spacious pathway for a big group of tourist.
97,5.0,"Such a beautiful building designed by the late Zaha Hadid. A must-visit for all art enthusiasts. You don't have to be knowledgeable with art to appreciate their exhibits. I was lucky to view Paik Nam June's full show the first time I visited and a smaller PNJ exhibition the second time I went. Both shows knocked my socks off!Inside, you can sit on benches designed by Zaha and shop at the M1 building where you can find quirky items and toys. :)"
98,4.0,The plaza is full of variety of goods only you have to negotiate wisely. Woolen clothes can be on priority list as you get wide variety of fashions and styles. The souvenirs though rather at a fixed and higher price.
99,3.0,The structure of this building makes it look a bit like a UFO and gives off this futuristic vibe. Do check out the exhibitions in there if you have time to spare! Recommend visiting at night with all the lights on.
100,3.0,"Not a must see in my honest opinion. Nice to see the building, but the inside was so, so. Much more interesting things to do when in Seoul if you ask me."
101,5.0,Always wondered what was inside this interesting shaped building.  When we walked in we were surprised by the shops and places to eat.  Worth walking through!
102,5.0,"Absolutely incredible building (RIP Zaha Hadid) and generally really well used space. The whole thing feels very modern without verging on a dated image of the future. A treat to just be there and walk around but the work on display really takes things up a notch. We were lucky enough to catch a mixed media Paik Nam June retrospective and a terrific, considered exhibition of different types of bowls from restaurants and homes that was way more interesting than it sounds."
103,3.0,"Plan accordingly, we found to our dismay it was closed on Mondays except it's Design Market which housed merely a couple of restaurants and a handful of retail shops. We were able to venture outside it's open park which is OK but interesting. Don't just come here for this attraction. However, it is very close to Dondaemun market where all the wholesalers are. Awe inspiring place, can't find anything like this in USA. So if you planned to visit DDP make it a whole day iterinary to visit Dondaemun also, walk the Seoul city walls which you can pick up opposite Heungjimun Gate. This is a quieter trail and less challenging."
104,4.0,The min you exit the subway you will be attracted to this building. Usually someone will be playing some music
105,4.0,"I didn't think much of the place when I saw it from across the road from the building in the day.  But it is extremely impressive in the nights with the lights and all.In the weekends, its surroundings are lively with entertainment and little craft stalls."
106,3.0,"A building that has art gallery + exhibitions. Visited here during evening, so unable to see any gallery at all. The main attractions here is the 'white' roses. A pretty scenery to look at but not all people enjoy this. If you are not the type to enjoy this kind of attractions, cross out from your itinerary or visit here after visiting the Doota Mall or other malls, just across the road from here."
107,5.0,"I never saw a place like this. DDP has really a modern, unique and futuristic design. You can take picture everywhere in this place and you can see the LED flower at night"
108,4.0,There was the same light show in HK last year. We were delighted to see the same show in the Design Plaza. There isn't a lot of tourists visiting the plaza and we can have plenty of time and space to take pics with friends.
109,5.0,"For you who watch korean drama must have seen a place with a white led rose scenery, and this is the place where you can see those white led rose flowers. For me it's better to see it at night cause all of those flowers with glow but maybe it's a bit hard to take pictures at night. The design of this building is just amazing and fascinating with such a beautiful lightning at night. Apparently this building closed at 11pm so for you who wants to look around inside the building maybe you should pay attention."
110,5.0,"Possibly the highlight of my trip. Visit at night for best experience. A very nice place to appreciate the architecture of the building. My favourite part of DDP is where the LED roses are located  (you can ask the guards for direction, they are very helpful) as i am able to sit down at the benches provided and enjoy the skylines of Dongdaemun. After visiting, you can pop by to the opposite buildings for shopping (opens till 4am)!"
111,5.0,"nice architecture with shops for shopper, museum and art exhibition for interested parties.  You can spent a day here."
112,4.0,"I visit Dongdaemun market and accidentally found this interesting design plaza and the I SEOUL U that people said about too much before, only the sign here much smaller"
113,4.0,"Visited this place at night. It's quite an interesting architecture to view, with several sculptures displayed as well. We did not go inside the museum and decided to walk around the plaza instead. A 30 minute walk/stroll would be enough in this place."
114,3.0,This is a modern building. Its trends of Seoul city. Nearby with dongdaemun plaza so have a lot of travelers go to this place. I like this building because its stylish design. Appropriated for take a photos.
115,5.0,"Visited this venue afew days ago. Take the green subway line 2 and exit by exit 1 which is obvious due to its design as part of the building. As a first-timer, I was privileged to be able to visit the ongoing flea market held only on weekends, late evenings for this month. Do find out more on their website if you're keen. There's many things to do during this summer period on a weekend - visit the mobile food  carts (long queues for tasty food), flea market hosting many local designers items (but i prefer hongdae's free market), enjoy the light up led roses at night. Many photo opportunities indeed. I also liked my souvenirs purchased at the design shop. A special mention will be the architecture with its interesting spiral staircase designed by Zaha Hadid. I was also privileged to visit the ongoing exhibition paying homage to the late artist's Mr Paik Nam Jun. Eventful. One can visit the 24-hour shopping malls in the vincinity or hop on the tour bus infront of DDP after that. Do take time to spend your afternoon and evening here. Worth it. Will be ideal to read up online for more info on activities."
116,5.0,The exterior of the DDP is already an art. There's a museum inside as well as some ongoing exhibitions. An eye-opener for me!
117,4.0,"I stayed right next to the DDP and walked over one night to take pictures. Never got the time to go in during opening hours of the museum, but just walking around and taking pictures at night was beautiful. It's a wonderful space."
118,4.0,"I came here after dinner for a walk. Found the LED flowers by asking staff for help. The flowers are so pretty, just keep taking pictures!!! There are a lot of people here, everybody here for the pictures I guess (including me)."
119,4.0,"Personally, we went to Dongdaemun for the DDP only. The design of the entire complex is very good. We were quite spellbound by it. If you like to take ""vogue"" photography, this is one of the places you can explore. There is a very neat design store in one of the blocks. Be sure to go there. There are many interesting stuff on display / sale. We spent an hour in it."
120,4.0,Great to stroll around at night - they had a flower lights display at the time so it was really pretty at night.
121,4.0,"Is a good place to hang out. Come visit at night for the beautiful rose garden. Bring coffee and with the person you want to spend time with 😆. Several stores at there, nothing special. There is a piano at public, anyone can play it."
122,5.0,This place is built for designers. Amazing place for photography and enjoy shopping designer's brand. This place have galleries and even have the 360-degree photo booth that captures yourself to create a nice miniature or sculpture of you! Went here in March and last week (July) was my second visit here and should also explore shops outside the plaza especially for those who loves sports!
123,3.0,"You can take a nice walk outside, see interesting peaces of art and take great pictures. The building itself is very futuristic, I think it looks like a spacecraft waiting to take off. But anyhow, there are museums/exhibitions inside that you can visit with an entrance fee. The outside area is of course free."
124,4.0,such unique building. and there were an outdoor skiing place in front of it which cool. I went there on winter tho. not sure if they still have it in summer
125,5.0,"DDP is one of Zaha Hadid's last works and that only makes it special!  A clean design and a lot of contrast with its surroundings. Peace in the middle of caos. In order to appreciate the purpose for what it was created, I visited Jean Paul Gaultier exhibition and I love it!  They had animated mannequins singing and talking.  Even Gaultier introduce himself :-DSo not only recommended for architecture lovers.  If you love exhibitions, there could be something for you too. And even better, it is located in front of wholesale buildings and you can buy cheap clothes for the whole family.  If you have patience, you can find really nice things!"
126,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a great example of Seoul's new architecture. It's definitely worth a visit for anyone who loves architecture and design.The DDP isn't just a strange looking building, though. The DDP is also known as Dongdaemun History and Culture park, and is accessed via a station of the same name. The DDP also includes an exhibition hall, a ""design market"" (which is basically a small shopping mall) and a museum. I highly recommend visiting on any day other than Monday as, like most cultural places in Seoul, the museum is closed on Mondays."
127,3.0,It is a strange feeling to be in... But most of the restaurants are just great! Good for a short visit.
128,4.0,Going here to see led flower festival. This plaza and all the buildings suround it are look so beautiful during nights..
129,5.0,Amazing structure on an unbelievable scale.  The building complex is massive - you can't really grasp the scale unless you are there looking at the building with your own eyes. Fabulous in the evening with dramatic lighting.
130,5.0,"Must visit for those looking for artisan and unique products ~ the design shops sell items that vary from watches to bags, to unique souvenirs. Items are a little pricier than the usual fare in Korea though."
131,3.0,"This place is really nice to visit, is designed by a woman designer , u really need to spend 2-3 hours to explore this place"
132,5.0,You will have to spend a whole day in this building. Get a solid camera with wide angels to take in the sights. Or go up to neighbouring buildings to capture more pictures.
133,4.0,"The building itself is an architectural wonder. The shapes, the lines, the movement -- if you like architecture, this is a must to see. I went on a weekend and there were a number of vendors set up outside selling all manners of stuff: food (even free samples!), honey, jams, flowers, trinkets, handmade jewelry -- all tasteful and nothing kitchy. I should have spent more time inside as it is so different-looking than the outside. The building is so modern in so many ways.There is a wonderful LED flower garden that must be spectacular at night (I saw it during the daytime) and even an archeological site on the grounds, kept fairly intact.The building is on a couple subway lines and also has shops and restaurants galore in the underground arcade. There is loads of shopping in the district around Dongdaemun as well, as this is quite a fashion district of Seoul."
134,5.0,The myriads of shops are amazing .. However be prepared for no fitting rooms/ clean toilets / credit card payments/ sign language to bargain !
135,4.0,Good for relax and take a picture. There are not much to do in this place but you can take a picture with a thousand  electric flower.
136,5.0,"Awesome!!! First, stylish and unique architecture designed by the world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, 3-dimensional structure, plaza and park integrated as one, column-free interior space. Second, all-in-one complex, having an one-stop design, cultural and lifestyle experience. 24 hours design gallery shopping and café, very cool!! Third, last but not least, 25,550 LED roses planted on the grounds of the DDP. The artificial roses light up when night falls. So stunning night view. You can't miss it when travelling in Seoul!"
137,3.0,"Besides the very impressive design from outside, it's a regular shopping centre/mall with many shops selling all sorts of fashion articles."
138,5.0,"I went there at night, there are two lines of LED Rose which are really beautiful and romantic, not much people are there and it is very good place for pictures taking. A must-go place at night 🙂"
139,4.0,"DDP is a complex of design buildings. Many fashion show often hold there. Also other outdoor art performances. Inside these buildings are simply design exhibitions, including the buildings are a product of designing itself.If you're lucky like me, you can attend Seoul Fashion Week ̣ - normally in March . You can see many fashionista and celibrities dressing up and taking photos outside the building. It was also an uinique experiences though - that Seoul-ers really really love dress up and care about the beauty most in Asia - i mean both men and women"
140,5.0,"I did not go inside. I just went there to see the LED roses, it is very beautiful. I think this place is very romantic."
141,3.0,go walk around and see the architecture. really nice to see it at night with all the lightings. there are some exhibitions if you're interested.
142,4.0,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza, designed by Iraqi British architect Zaha Hadid and Korean studio Samoo, houses a fashion design information center with seminar rooms and a lecture hall.The Dongdaemun Design Plaza, also called the DDP, is a major urban development landmark in Seoul, South Korea designed by Zaha Hadid and Samoo, with a distinctively neofuturistic design characterized by the ""powerful, curving forms of elongated structures"". The landmark is the centerpiece of South Korea's fashion hub and popular tourist destination, Dongdaemun, featuring a walkable park on its roofs, large global exhibition spaces, futuristic retail stores and restored parts of the Seoul fortress.Both at night (specially with the Roses LED) and during the day, the place is just photogenic!!!!"
143,4.0,"Good to have a walk at the Design Plaza, especially the scene at night was amazing. There were LED light up to the pools of flower made the environment is romantic and cozy."
144,5.0,"Also called the DDP, is a major urban development landmark in Seoul. Beautiful place to take photos. The view at night was stunning with all the lights and led roses."
145,4.0,"DDP is a convention hall with curving architecture and a rooftop park which is newest landmark in Korea , one of the of Zaha's work. Also a lots of shopping around this area"
146,3.0,"The building's design is very good and it is easily accessible.  It is also very near to the shopping centers.  We went there when there was an exhibition of Jean Paul Gaultier.  Other than that, there was also a floor with many designers.  It was all great but since it was just opened some time ago, the building still feels empty-ish and it was a little confusing to navigate around it."
147,5.0,"Absolutely amazing, especially to think that the exterior is covered by over 40,000 aluminum tiles of which no two are exactly alike. It was so interesting to walk about and see how they were able to make it all work considering the numerous contours."
148,5.0,"If you love modern Architecture, this place is for you.  The lighting here is amazing so I would suggest to go at night. You can also go inside and check the building."
149,4.0,"The architecture is excellent. The museum/gallery is not open on mondays, like most other galleries. The surrounding area is really cool too, many shopping centres."
150,4.0,The design of this building was really impressive and it was in the middle of a busy shopping district. I'd check this place out if you like shopping for modern design items.
151,4.0,"This is a great design itself and really impressive. A good place to ""check-in"" and taking photos in the lightening rose garden would give you amazing photos."
152,5.0,"If you love drama and design coming together in one place, please visit the DDP center in the evening as it is fantastic. Also it will make for super cool photos. Grab a coffee and take a stroll through the grounds while you marvel at the exterior, after you're done pick one of the many entrances and explore the art and design that is all around."
153,5.0,Great architecture and an impressive area around. I haven't been inside the plaza. Yet the area around and especially the light flower garden guarantees a good time. Definitely worth seeing.
154,5.0,"The building itself is beautiful and well worth a walk around. The internal exhibition spaces are not accessed from the main foyer which was a surprise. The two exhibitions that were there at the end of December were both challenging and thought-provoking, especially the works about Korean identity."
155,5.0,"The impressive architecture houses some really awesome exhibits. Just like some other buildings in Seoul, they have found a way to preserve history and culture of the old (Dongdaemun) and improve it with a very modern building During winter there is also a rose led garden on the plaza grounds that light up the night.Inside is a delightful exhibit room that brings you three stories up in a spiral path without you even noticing that you have."
156,5.0,"The architecture from Zaha Hadid is just awesome and totally inspiring!Also always interesting special exhibitions (last ones: Andy Warhol, Alessandro Mendini...)For sure one place to visit if u r in town!U can easily connect it with a shopping tour, because the building is surrounded by a thousand shopping malls!"
157,5.0,"Hotel happened to be walking distance from this architectural marvel, thus the chance to see it repeatively, day and night. At night, the panels on the structure will light up intermittently, giving a spacecraft like vibe, also check out the lighted flower installation scattered within the compound, do check for exhibition period and daily operating hours."
158,5.0,this is one of my fave places in seoul!  the architecture of the building is awesome!  it houses creative inventions of local designers as well as fun modern pieces from other countries.  eye candies everywhere!!!  there is a dining area inside if ever you get hungry.  there are also malls nearby so you can spend the whole afternoon there till evening to enjoy the city lights.
159,5.0,"Beautiful place, especially at night. The parking was a bit hard to figure out, however it added fun to our adventure. The architecture is beautiful. If you appreciate the work Hadid does, it is definitely worth a visit."
160,4.0,Beautiful structure! Went there because of the LED flower. Pretty when visit at night. Worth to chill when visit dongdaemum.
161,5.0,"When I walked out of the subway station, I was completely overwhelmed with the astonishing and  sleek building in front of me. This place is totally different from what I visited about ten year ago! The building itself portrays what the future world will be like and as an art and design center, it it definitely worth visiting. Taking a stroll here at night is an enjoyable excursion.非常前衛且令人震撼的建築。眼前流線不規則的大樓主體讓人彷彿到訪未來世界。一旁的玫瑰燈海增添夜晚浪漫氣息。這區域是個非常有活力的地段，值得一遊。"
162,5.0,"This complex of buildings is absolutely amazing. It blew all my expectations out of the water. I was overwhelmed by all the pop-up designer shops in the Design Lab area. We shopped a lot in this area for unique souvenirs. If nothing else, stop by and walk through the Design Lab area to look around at the offerings."
163,4.0,"I came to this building because one of SM Pop-up store opens here. Turned out I was totally amazed with the design. With the outstanding design from outside, you can't missed this place if you're visiting Dongdaemun area. Inside the building, the design also very simple and there are many stores selling cute-handicraft thingy. Outside the building, there are many teenagers selling their self-produced product (the price is quite expensive tho).Since at first I visited to take a look to SM Pop-up store, it was not really satisfying for me. The store in COEX still much better, but if you're trying to find some rare merchandises, maybe you can give a shot to the store here in DDP since the stuffs in COEX selling out soo fast.Overall, I enjoyed this building and its futuristic design."
164,5.0,"I have been to the Dongdaemun Design Plaza 3 times now and every time it has been interesting. This place offers private vendors to offer their artwork, jewelry, crafts, and has random special events. The first time I went the Seoul Fashion show was going on and it was crazy packed, but very cool. The other times the plaza had featured artists. Make sure you check out the calendar for special events! I have not been here at night, but it's on my to-do list!"
165,4.0,Really futuristic building great for photo ops! This place is beautifully lit at night and filled with couples or groups of friends out for a night of fun. The exhibits that are held here are quite interesting too.
166,5.0,we didint go in..but the grounds and area was lovely... took lots of pics.. and wandered around for about an hour...
167,5.0,"Visited after sunset, this modern art building is such a treat for those who loves light! They have LED roses all over the garden, as well as the very interesting design shop where you can buy all sorts of souvenirs and artsy fartsy stuff. The building has its own exit on the subway, thus it is very accessible."
168,5.0,DDP is huge and brilliantly lit. Such a nice view at night. There are art galleries inside and an adjacent shopping center.
169,4.0,"Designed by the renowned Architect, Zaha Hadid, this iconic structure stands out as a juxtaposition to all the other buildings in the city. Its ultra-modern, organic design is typical of Hadid's structures. If you're an architect or a lover of the arts, this comes highly recommended. Apart from the structure itself being a piece of art, there are several museums and shops inside the center. Items come a bit pricey tho as expected. Quality doesn't come cheap. Art installations can also be seen around the vicinity. One that particularly stands out is the field of white artificial flowers with led lights which, obviously is best viewed at night. Another one that struck me was how well they preserved the ruins found on the site and incorporated it into the design. The only negative comment I have is the lack of English brochures and the non-English speaking receptionists. The maps are quite easy to follow tho so this should not be a problem."
170,4.0,"Nice place for photo the building is very unique and beautiful. there are a lighting flower bed that is really beautiful hidden in the area, really niceee"
171,4.0,Head to the flower hill to see LED lighted roses. Lighting starts at 6:00PM. The building itself is very modern and is a good place to just chill and relax.
172,4.0,It was most unfortunate that we arrived the DDP in the evening and rainy. Could not take very nice nor clear photos of this vast architectural monument. It was just boasting of space and awe.
173,4.0,"Three years ago, I come this location as night market, but today I saw a excellent new concept building and fantastic."
174,5.0,The DDP as it is called is home to a large design museum and an enormous retail space filled with all sorts of beautifully designed products.
175,4.0,"The building is very artistic and there are museums within the DDP. Do note the opening hours of the museums if you intend to visit them, but otherwise the place is good for pictures and taking a break."
176,4.0,Worth visiting while waiting for the big stores across the street to open (10:30 am). Cavernous interior.
177,4.0,"DDP is one of the most uber futuristic buildings that I have ever seen, smack in the middle of a great evening shopping area.  The Design Plaza itself is beautiful, with the 21,000 LED light roses planted in the roof garden a spectacular sight.  The accompanying craft market has some nice gifts.  In the streets around DPP there are extensive markets, and only a block away, is the river walk, and part of the old Seoul City Wall.  There are numerous restaurants in the shops surrounding DDP, and the quirky Korean sight of roadside stages with troupes of young women competing in K-Pop styled competitions.There are numerous exhibitions and events held at DPP.  While I was there it was an Andy Warhol exhibition, concerts, and Vans Skateboarding competitions and exhibitions, so something to appeal to everyone.Very easy to access as the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park subway station has multiple lines."
178,4.0,"This is a place of twists and turns, and you'd better have your walking shoes on when you visit. The shows are either free, or have small fee attached, and considering that spending time with great art not only soothes your soul but benefits your body, I can recommend it. And once you are done taking in the art, you can sip a craft beer, eat some great food and real in the shopping area."
179,5.0,Amazing LED White Rose!  can not image that more than 25thousand LED in the garden.But i'm wondering why it is only white colour?? I though red or pink or other colour better than white
180,5.0,DDO is designed by Zaha Hadid and is a great 3D architectural design. There is a shopping mall and Art exhibition and few food places. The building has a unique design which let you see it from different angles and find its design differently.
181,4.0,"The curves and design of the building are a feast for the eyes. As the name would suggest, this is a place where designers come together to sell their goods so much of it has a retail focus. There is also the design museum and history park with a number of art installations positioned around the grounds."
182,4.0,"In the evening, the place was lit up and it resembled a huge space ship. The flower lights were magnificent. The hour we went the galleries were closed, I'm gonna be there for the galleries the next time."
183,3.0,A nice place to walk around. Has some cute shops. Looks cool at night. Worth a visit if you have several days in the city.
184,5.0,"The site is a former baseball stadium , reclaimed for public use.  The area is historically significant and a buzz of activity.  This is where shoppers go for clothes from late morning till around two A.M. Sitting right in the centre of the action is Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DPP) without doubt one of the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. Housing galleries, and design spaces.  It is a must see for anyone traveling to Seoul.  The building is incredible at any time of day, but to see its true ufo likeness, visit at night.  Also at night the LED flower field is alight and the area surrounding DPP has food trucks and craft stalls.  Great eats and unique shopping."
185,5.0,"DDP is an eye-catching trendy landmark which has given a new face of Dongdaemun, and a mixture of modern architecture and historical ruins. Apart from shopping, another choice for travellers to experience art and culture. You will be excited by many innovative ideas of modern Koreans at the designer lab."
186,5.0,"It was very nice to stop by the Design plaza before go find some souvenir in the stores of the area.They have a lots of good deals with high quality finishing and with a cool looking, thanks to the design theme that they choose to have in all articles offered there!It really worth the trip!"
187,5.0,"This building is breath-taking. Once we stopped in front of it, we were like WOW. It was really amazing, We were just thinking what is it and what's inside. We quickly rushed and found a subway, entrance for malls but one of the best thing on my trip ""The Design Lab"".Yes, that's what they have named it. It is a very unique thing which I saw, they have redesigned existing things into something else which they sell at economic rates. It is very big, outside is nice park to walk and feel the fresh air"
188,4.0,The DDP is simply gorgeous. Just beautiful. You don't really have to actually go into the halls to be at awe by its beauty. I was just walking in some of the areas and surrounding the DDP. You will appreciate its beauty even more if you visit it at night as I did. Definitely worth the journey. I got to see the LED roses too which made DDP even more beautiful.
189,4.0,If you like shopping and spending an entire day in one facility then this is the place for you.All types of clothing and apparel.
190,5.0,"Nice place. Art galleries, and the architecture, by itself is so pretty. Very well located. Definately a must see."
191,3.0,nothing much to see here unless you appreciate buildings with unique architecture and interior. there are couples of branded stores near MRT exits and if you're lucky you probably can find some interesting exhibitions inside the plaza.
192,5.0,"An Amazing building that have a fantastic exhibition space, you can take fantastic photos! they also have a design store that is very big but the selection is just OK"
193,3.0,"It was OK as there was a panda exhibition outside at the time I went, but the place is a bit soulless and it's unlikely you'll want to spend much time around here"
194,4.0,"At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this building.  After multiple visits, I've concluded that I like the exterior and the art market, but I don't like most of the interior.  I have a feeling that the interior spaces didn't turn out quite as Zaha Hadid intended.  They feel cheap.  The current exhibitions from Dior and the Ganseong Museum are well worth the price of entry."
195,5.0,"This plaza is a phenomenon and really got me in awe. I think its good for those that like to observe architecture, but also for those that just like to look at museums or quirky shops. Inside the plaza there are tons of museums and shops that sell unique things you cant get elsewhere."
196,4.0,"Very futuristic architecture reminiscent of a spaceship. There are some shopping strip malls and exhibitions held inside the Design Plaza. I attended the exhibition of ""You Who Came from the Stars"" sometime back in the summer of last year in 2014, and it was very appropriate to hold the exhibition in this plaza hall, because of the futuristic themed structure of this building. The building looks weird in the daytime, but at night, it morphs into this spaceship lookalike structure with all the various lights and adornments being lit."
197,4.0,"Every tourist, almost i mean, wants to shop at Dongdaemum.Shop till you drop as there are thousands to shop.Eat various Korean street food and dishes nearby.Visit this space shuttle lookalike building to make your eyes open wide for different world  than the neighbor. A bit unbalanced structure where Korea's traditional architecture, Dongdaemum is just next corner."
198,5.0,"Very modern complex of futuristic buidings with inside Museum, Galleries, cinema, theathre as well.The exterior shell of the building is cladded with aluminium panels and looks a bit like a space ship that is harmoniously integrated in a garden on the roof where you can walk.Close around this place, you can find a shopping center where to buy a lot of stuff and as usual a lot of places where to eat."
199,5.0,"It was unfortunate I wasn't able to go inside but viewing the building from the outside was simply amazing. Nearby is Myeongdong, a popular shopping area."
200,5.0,"Couples have long visited this long street wondering off at the nightlife here in Seoul. At dongdaemun design centre, it is purely romantic with a nightlife design of flowers, I cannot simply imagine. It stood beautiful with figures all around the world. But what I found it best was the fact that it was designed with an intention to develop creative minds within the people of Seoul. Long later, it attracts tourist around the world which leaves a greater insight and passion for the world of architecture."
201,4.0,"This is the great place to explore design-related shows and exhibitions. If you have time, wait until the sunset - the view at nights is remarkably beautiful. PS. A Korean drama series - You Who Came from the Stars was filmed here. ;)"
202,5.0,"Honestly for a place that doesn't charge for admission (other than n special exhibits, its a great place to explore. I enjoyed it more than I originally assumed. There are some very cool little boutique stores inside worth exploring to pick up some neat souvenirs. I love going here from sunset till evening to check out the structure and picture taking for daytime and evening when it lights up."
203,4.0,"the building looks unique and is located very very near Dongdaemun shopping complex, just a short walking distance. There are some shops inside (e.g. convenient stores, cosmetics store, and many more). it's quite big and you can take a look and a walk, explore..."
204,4.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is several exhibition halls linked on a city block next to a subway station. Access is excellent and there is shopping all around. It looks very modern, and has museums to show the old site of the stadium which was there before.A good change of pace from shopping!Unfortunately not every hall had exhibitions and some of the hallways seemed a bit empty."
205,5.0,"Did not enter the movie sence, I just take pic with the lovely ""Big egg"" and with nice design! Better to go there at Night, coz there some lighting outside the building 👍 of coz food and some shops inderground"
206,5.0,Dongdaemon Design Plaza is an amazing landmark. The design is fluid and futuristic. This is a must see landmark when you go to Seoul. A marvel work of Architect Zaha Hadid!
207,5.0,"http://wp.me/p5Lw9a-7l... The great thing about DDP is because it’s open for public, it’s permenant, it’s located in a prime location, it has shops and it constantly has different theme exhibitions; therefore, people from all walks of life could be inside the building and “enjoy something” with it. I was there just in time to visit the exhibit for the super hit TV show “My Love from the Star” in 2014 :P. The exhibition hall showcased photos and fun facts about the show plus life-size shooting sets.DDP is also surrounded by malls, and connected to malls. I had dinner @ the “n TABLE” – a buffet-style hotpot where inevitably to try a lot Korean style fried chicken and kimchi, all I can say is - Good price, nice food. Another place opposite to n TABLE is a dessert place for Patbingsu. Patbingsu is a Korea style shaved ice dessert, usually mixed with condensed milk (love) fruits or beans, refreshing for the boiling summer.After I was well-fed, I continue my quest of shopping in the long-hour opening malls on the other side of the road!"
208,5.0,"Grab a camera and walk all around this building, inside and out. The architecture is spectacular. There is s garden on the roof.  Fun to see at different times of day as the sun reflects on the surface."
209,4.0,"It's architecture is very impressive. Very modern and futuristic? There are shops, restaurants etc. We took pictures and had a little walk with my cousins and friends. If you have time, you can visit this place, have a stroll and rest. :)"
210,5.0,Very huge architecture that was designed by Zaha Hadid. The architecture is great. Many beautiful point to take photo. Have museum and design shop inside. Don't forget to visit the rose garden on rooftop... great for day & night scenery.
211,4.0,"The architecture of Dongdaemun Design Plaza is very unique compare to other buildings in Korea. However, this place doesn't offer various place of restaurants or activities. So, it will be good if you come here when an exhibition is held otherwise the only thing to see is the building only. Anyway, this place is worth to visit though."
212,5.0,"The construction itself is breathtaking not only because of its enormous size, but also because the architecture is pretty interesting. The place is dedicated to arts and design so if you're into that you can loose yourself there for a long period and fall in love at each step. There was an amazing artificial garden with lightened white roses right next to the building when I visited, which was just incredible. It should be kept in mind that it is although is has an amazing atmosphere it is an expensive place for eating and shopping. One of my favourite places in Seoul."
213,3.0,Once you get out of the subway you can't miss this futuristic building. The museum itself it ok. It's really nice to walk around it. But it isn't a must see museum. You can still walk around the building and see the outside if you don't want to go inside.
214,4.0,dongdaemun is one of the largest shopping districts in korea so the location is perfect for tourists and locals alike. this futuristic spaceship looking place is gorgeous and grand! lots of unique items sold inside. definitely worth a visit!
