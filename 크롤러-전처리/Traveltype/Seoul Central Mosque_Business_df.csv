0,4.0,"It was located at very Nice Area of Seoul , It is Clean, and the other advantage of this Masjid is near to many halal restaurants"
1,5.0,"Whenever I am in Seoul, this is one place that I always make a point to visit. One can meet other  Muslims in Seoul who live in the city and other muslim travelers. In fact, I was there during Ramadhan in 2015 and got a chance to break my fast with other mosque goers!As many reviewers have mentioned, this is the biggest, if not the only Mosque in Seoul. It has his own history and has other activities organized, not only the 5 daily payers, Friday prayer and Taraweeh in Ramadhan. The mosque is located in Itaewon area - so accessible by train, although, you must walk a little bit and it could be literally  an 'uphill battle' for some people :-) However you will be definitely be rewarded with the experience.  There are also many good halal restaurants serving all kinds of dishes (Korean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Pakistani, Indian etc) near the Mosque so you could grab some food on your way back."

3,5.0,Beautiful Mosjid with an adjoining islamic school located on a hill top. Bit of a steep climb. Had the pleasure of praying one afternoon during Nov'2014. There is a plan to build a large mosjid complex. Most taxi drivers know the place. Several Indian/pak restaurants nearby. Saw a Halal meat shop as well nearby.
4,5.0,"I attended Jumuah prayers here.  The salaah begins early (at about 1:30pm) so get there early.  It's the only mosque in Seoul so the place gets packed.  Separate Ladies facilities are available,  which is to the left of the main entrance if you stand facing the mosque. The wudhu facilities are looked to the right of the mosque entrance in what appears to be a 40-foot container-like structure.  The mosque is abit of a walk from the itaewon station, but given the very little halal places in Seoul, it is a welcome sight and you feel quite at home. The adjacent area had many Islamic shops and halal eating places (beware: a lot of the indo-Pakistan owned restaurants are licensed, which would annoy if you are after strictly halal food)."
