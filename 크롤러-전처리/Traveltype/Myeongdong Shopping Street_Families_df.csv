1,4.0,This is the place if you want to enjoy a variety of street food in Seoul. They have  some halal food also
2,5.0,A great street to walk around. Make up and face masks are really worthwhile. Food is a bit expensive compared to other markets. Retailers really exploit tourism
3,5.0,"One of the most popular shopping districts in Seoul and for a reason. It's always crowded, especially during the evenings when all the street food carts are in full swing. I would come here just for the street food from simple veggies to exotic lobsters and shrimps and everything in between. One can find almost every brand here and of course a wide range of cosmetic products. (Carry a stroller if traveling with very small children)"
4,5.0,"Love the area... all sorts of street food that was amazing!!! Shopping stores left & ryt!!! Its a convinient place to buy all sorts of things.  They also have local grill restos that served good food.  We ate during Xmas eve at one of the grill resto- i forgot the name, but the meat was delicious!!!"
5,5.0,There's a lot of spot shopping in Seoul but this one is the best. Because they have good price. Low price but good quality. If you want some souvenir from Korea this is one place that you should come
6,4.0,Things are more expensive in Myeongdong than other locations in Seoul.There are definitely more tourist in Myeongdong  . It is very central to everything . But very crowded in Christmas .
7,5.0,"This place is the best place in seoul. This place have everything like streetfood anykind of food you want myeongdong have it...also about shopping street they have everything you dont have to go anywhere in seoul. Everything sell in dongdaemun myeongdong have it....everything sell in gangnam myeongdong have...from shoes, clothing, bags and cosmetic they have complete all stuff"
8,4.0,"It's a well known fact that Myeong-dong is a beauty product wonderland and not to mention, beer and fried chicken.It's a must go for any first timer in Seoul and also beauty products fanatics.It's a lovely and vibrant place with tons of street food too. The only downsides are the animal cafes not letting kids in, a pity."
9,5.0,"First time or frequent visitors, this place is a must! Street food stalls are by 4pm everyday until past midnight. Shops and shops and shops, and restaurants after restaurants, cafes and salons and OMG everything you need. If you can, visit this place weeknights, because it‚Äôs extremely packed on the weekend."
10,4.0,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber.  The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints.  Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming.  Travel time was between 45-60 minutes.Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets.  The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors.  We found ATMs in the area.  We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food.  There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few.We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections.  We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks.  The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites.  Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport.  These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores.What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food.Fun experience and felt very safe in the area."
11,4.0,The street comes alive at night and better when the weather is a bit cooler. Much nicer than nigjt market in Taiwan.
12,5.0,"Wow! You have to visit Myeongdong- the shops here are amazing- lots of beauty shops in particular! ‚ÄúFree‚Äù face masks are offered to lure you into shops but sometimes you can just take them and keep walking. It is super crowded here so be aware you will be bumped into n jostled a bit- all part of the experience! By about 4pm the street food carts come out- oh my goodness the variety, the look n smell is delicious! Is there anything fried that is not tasty?? No!! Try the crepes with Nutella, banana n cornflakes- yum! Egg rolls, corn dogs, fried chicken- all sooo good!"
13,5.0,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom‚Äôs flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it‚Äôs really busy. That being said we still loved the place. Go and enjoy all it has to offer.
14,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street has all the beauty goods you need to find, every brand , every product. The freebies that comes with every purchase is also quite generous. Watch out for periodic value 1+1 buys if you intend to stay few days."
15,5.0,"This Myeongdong Street seems never ending road. Before our legs breaks from sores, there are still lots more and more to walk. Filled with many nearby shopping centres and of course street food. It‚Äôs very Yummy and walking down the streets during winter is superb cooling for us! In fact, it‚Äôs quite freezing. Will definitely come back here again!"
16,4.0,"As part of our tour itinerary, we visited the Myeongdong street for a couple of hours. There is a Lotte duty free mall nearby as well, though its more for branded goods. The Myeongdong street was packed with locals and tourists alike. Most of the shops are selling cosmetics, face masks, fashion accessories, and many streetside stalls with local food."
17,4.0,"Interesting area with quite a number of cute places , shops , restaurants and night market . I prefer this area over Gangnam area which is to large and takes too long time to walk.Recomendable for tourists."
18,5.0,Located just along the train station. This place boasts a lot of fashion shopping and food( both street food and restaurants). Really a haven for the foodies even in winter.
19,5.0,"Perfect place for first timer. U get food and u get shopping. This is the place to shop for beauty products. Night market starts at about 4pm where vendors start setting up, buzzling till 11.30pm. very convenient with Myeongdong station and euljiro 1(San) station nearby."
20,3.0,"Street is full of shops selling cosmetics. Sellers will try to lure you into their shops by offering you free mask. In the evening, there will be lots and lots of vendors selling street food. Price of food in this area are generally more expensive than other places like Hongdae, Ehwa Woman‚Äôs Univ and Namdaemun Market. Streets are usually packed even on weekdays.Am giving it a 3 star because i am not into cosmetics and i think the prices are a more expensive too. I think this place is overrated, though i must say there are some pretty good eateries around eg Migabon (portion is smaller than Bon Juk but i found it nicer than Bon Juk) Myeongdong Kyoja (their dumplings are superb) and Yoogane Chicken Galbi. Apart from cosmetics, there are of course other shops/ mart selling other korean food eg almonds, potato chips etc"
21,5.0,"Plenty of stuff to buy especially souveniers. My kids bought loads of socksüòä for themselves as well as for friends. Fila stores are almost everywhere and the shoes are a bargain. Vendors start to setup their carts only around 3pm onwards so will be better to go there after 3pm to soak in the ambience. Hard to find rubbish bin so keep all your trash before disposing them properly. Train station is nearby as well, so will be a good experience to take the public transport. Plenty of cosmetics shops and a good place to buy snacks home as souveniers because it is cheapest here."
22,4.0,"Surprisingly, of all the places that I have been to that are famous for street food such as Taiwan and Thailand, I actually like Seoul. I guess the only drawback for Seoul is that the street food is quite expensive and not exactly value for money. However, taste wise I really loved Seoul street food. They have all sorts of delicious food from cheesy lobster go souffl√© with strawberries."
23,5.0,"Just beside Line 4 Myeongdong station exit 5, 6 7, 8, 9 n 10.A lot branded shop, hawker food stall, souvenir shop etc."
24,5.0,"Awesome place with friendly people ÿå clean erea , cheap cosmetics products , also street food must try ."
25,5.0,"The family loved Myeongdong that we came back more than 4x during our two weeks stay in Seoul. It is different when going in daytime and nighttime.It is more lively at night with street food vendors putting up in front of the shops selling shoes, beauty products, clothes etc.Be careful as it is crowded and packed with people."
26,3.0,"I stayed 4 nights in Myeongdong. If you are into beauty n skincare, this place is for you. Lots of masks, toiletries and skincare on sale. As for street food, it‚Äôs rather pricey, and sometimes prices vary from stall to stall. A stick of fish cake can cost krw 1000 to krw 4000. I tried grilled scallop which cost krw 10000. The shell was huge but contained very little meat, swimming in cheese. I felt I was eating cheese alone. The cheese hotdog was nice but you need to ignore the colour of oil used to fry it. Dark brown oil- recycled many times. Common sight at stalls that sell deep fried food. Stalls sell more or less the same type of food. Always ask for the price first."
27,4.0,"Amazing energy in this city. The crowd just continues to bustle up to 11pm with street food vendors and ‚Äòface mask pushers‚Äô in a backdrop of visual stimulus of bright neon lights and aesthetic display of modern shops. Great exposure and almost like a smorgasbord of Korean food in bite size quantity peppered at every corner. I would highly recommend trying the street food, it could certainly be good enough to make a meal out of it!"
28,4.0,Beauty shops are in every corner. After buying their products they will give you free facial mask (10pcs) or their new launch make-up. Street foods have the same pricing. So accessible to MTR.
29,4.0,"Stayed right at the beginning of Myeongdong shopping street. Street have a wide variety of Korean speciality Street food. Having hot fish cake in a soup cup is unbelievable on a freezing cold winter night. The strawberries are superb as well. Since the street caters primarily to tourists, prices are on a slightly high side. Lots of stores selling beauty products at decent prices.Avoid the restaurants though, the prices are high and quality not to the standard where you can find elsewhere."
30,5.0,"Best place to buy cosmetic products, shoes & clothes. Offers variety of street foods. Unfortunately all are not HALAL for muslim travellers. Good place to hang out."
31,4.0,"Crowded everyday and it has so many skin care shop especially face sheet mask and one time a salesman tried to trick me with giving me a sheet mask for free but when i want to get it, they try to pull me inside their store ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÄ"

48,5.0,"When I think of Korea, I think of 2 main things: face products and yummy food! The Myeongdong Night Market helped to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. First off, this market is crowded and very lively. There booths set up on the streets selling food, clothes, and souvenirs. The food was amazing! The 2 main things I would recommend are the Roast Lobster with Cheese and the egg bread. Both were really great. The streets are also lined with some of the most popular Korean skincare brands, including my personal favorite ‚ÄúHolika Holika‚Äù. Overall, if you‚Äôre wanting to eat some yummy food while sfocking up on face products, I would highly recommend shopping!"
49,5.0,"Every major city in Asia has a shopping area and combined with food stalls. Seoul has one and this place is crazy, especially in the evening hours. While the shop keepers try to lure you in to buying cosmetics, streets are lined with food stalls from either side with plenty of options, reasonably priced and decent quality. If you are a vegetarian, you will have limited choice but to see the spectacle, you must visit"
50,5.0,"My daughter and I stayed at a hotel right in the center of Myeongdong and proved to be the most convenient! If you are looking for anything For skin care.... this is absolutely the place. Do your research about Korean beauty products, there are a million brands ... it is quite overwhelming .... store after store offer beauty products. Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night. On Sundays, all the street food and bargain stalls set up in the middle of the streets making it much more fun even... it was nice to walk around the take a taste of the different kinds of street food. This street is a must see when in Seoul ."
51,5.0,"One can basically shop till they drop as there are countless of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes in the area. The street vendors will start setting up their stalls from about late morning and finishes late at night. Many of these vendors sell street food as well as other stuffs, so the area is a great spot to try Korean street food.Do bear in mind that in the evening and night, this place is packed. Also, we found some street vendors are selling some souvenirs at much higher prices than in Namdaemun market.Overall, it is a great spot for shopping and getting food,  whether it is restaurant or street food."
52,4.0,"Beauty products, clothings, bags, socks, snacks, street food, cafes, tea houses,  everything you need is here. Be sure to have a list before going to this area because you might end up buying things you dont really need. Kpop stuffs are abundant. You can get a lot of samples if you buy from cosmetic shops and they usually give you another item free. Dont get lost by taking picture of the street where you enter so you can go back to that area in going to your place. Street food costs around 3,000-4000 kr won, cosmetics at 1000-75.000 kr won and clothing from 6000-15,000 won for cheapest range. Restos from 12,000-33,000 kr won, its a set meal usually good for 3-4 pax. You will really enjoy this place. A must visit for traveler. A lot of cheap accomodation in the area."
53,5.0,Shopping street bustling with tourists and locals alike. Worth a visit... or 2... street food was expensive and had nothing to shout about though
54,4.0,Cannot move on with the shops and boutiques.hahaHahaI feel good and happy there.will come again later ehh
55,4.0,"here is a place where you can buy make ups and tons of korean beauty products. they also have some restaus, pharmacies, groceries and street food. live the street food especially the fried banana and glazed strawberries"
56,5.0,Full of tourists and nice ambience for shopping. Good prices and a lot of varieties but a lot of fake goods so beware
57,5.0,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our ‚Äúfantastically memorable ‚Äú Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you‚Äôll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It‚Äôs so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectatorüòã the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!"
58,5.0,We really enjoyed our visit here even though there are a lot of shoppers going around for this is a famous place that you need to visit when in Korea. Since my daughter loves korean beauty n makeup products she really went crazy buying stuffs for it is much cheaper here. Their street food is good if you're not picky.
59,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street was easy to access as it is near the subway station(exit 7). The shopping street has different things that you could buy such as souvenirs,branded shoes(fila,nike etc),bags and they even have street food that sells halal food which is easy for a muslim traveller like me. So you could grab street food whenever you are hungry while shoppingüòâ definitely recommend travellers to visit Myeongdong to shop‚ù§Ô∏è The price is affordable for certain things as some of souvenirs is pricey but as you walk around you‚Äôll find cheaper ones!!"
60,3.0,"I loved this place. When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends."
61,5.0,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too...  if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough."
62,4.0,"Its full of shops, and it will be no enough for 1-2 hours. Mostly cosmetic and sports shop. We tried to the food street, however we notice they sell the food veryyy pricey as they know many tourist come to the area. As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price. If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want. They usually stand in middle pf myeongdong. Love to see around myeongdong but will not buy food from there again."
63,4.0,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don‚Äôt embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look."
64,5.0,"No matter how many times I go to Myeongdong shopping street, I never got tired of it. There are so many shops and people, just very happening place. Lots of nice stuff to buy, apparels, food. We went to the same cafe on 2 consecutive days and will go again if we visit the street in future.At around 4pm, the street vendors start setting up their stalls and the whole place just gets busier.  Highly recommend this place to Seoul visitors."
65,3.0,"i‚Äôve been to seoul several times but i still can‚Äôt resist returning to this place to shop every time, particularly for masks and cosmetics. yes, it‚Äôs touristy and crowded, and you will be solicited by shopkeepers on the street every now and then (i haven‚Äôt encountered anyone particularly aggressive or pushy so they‚Äôre easy to brush off), but i would still recommend going there to shop for beauty products as there is a wide variety and the prices are decent."
66,4.0,"Actually this the second time here in Seoul, we stayed at royal hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, really this nice area , active day ,night, skin care , food,clothes ! You will enjoy while walking here, but August not good month to visit Seoul, so hot,rain also high humidity, choose another month to visit Seoul & enjoy. Regards"
67,5.0,"Nice environment, variety, reasonable prices, good service and great food.Definitely will come back! I recommend this place!"
68,4.0,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice.
69,4.0,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ‚Ç©16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.
70,4.0,"So many shops and currency exchange places.  Look for the currency exchange shops that are further into the shopping area.  You get a better rate.  For example, I used the first one I saw right by the main entrance and got 1160 per US Dollar.  Further in another stall was offering 1170 per US Dollar.  Is a difference if you exchange a larger amount of USC.  Also so many shopping, eating, desert, food places to enjoy.  We loved walking around here."
71,5.0,I stayed at Myeong-dong and the place is best during the night when the streets are full of food stalls. And the choices of food and makeup products is vast
72,5.0,"Cosmetic,local food,healty items,clothes,shoes .It's right place to find anything especially cosmetic items.However for those love to eat .it easy to find local food."
73,5.0,Wonderful time walking around with our family in this area. Very safe and lots of shops. Wonderful atmosphere in the evening with so many places to eat and shop!
74,3.0,Myeongdong is famous for shopping and street food. The area was filled with tourists and foreigners. I loved street food but it's too crowded to walk comfortably at times.
75,5.0,"We stayed for 5 days in Loisir Hotel (just a few steps away from shopping street), almost every day we would go here, and we can't seem to find the end of this street. I would personally explore more but since my parents' stamina is not exactly the best, moreover we brought our 20 months old niece with strollers... well you can imagine.Beware tho that this shopping street is not where the cheap stuff is. Cheap stuff goes to Namdaemun Market nearby. But if you want to experience the crowd, and want to know what's the hype all about, brace yourself for an ocean of people, smoky aroma form the food stalls, and not so clean streets. But hey, that's what we all want to experience, right? Because despite all that, we would totally go back and explore more of this infamous street."
76,5.0,"Crowded, but whatever you want to buy in Korea from food to make up to clothes can be bought here, lots of restaurants and also street food stalls open a bit later on. Must visit if in Seoul"
77,5.0,"There is a lot to do in this commercial district in Seoul South Korea. Hundreds of great fast food from shrimp tempura, seafood, pork belly and octopus skewers, caramelized plums, oh my God, my mouth is watering while i‚Äôm writing this review. From souvenir spaces to large fashion stores like H n M and so. Even an interactive racoon, cat, meerkat and kangaroo caf√©. We had so much fun. I have to say Korean people are awesome. They‚Äôre very attentive and nice."
78,5.0,"With all the shops, cafes, street food, and restaurants, Myeondong is such a fun area to explore. The lights, chatter, and aroma of street food tingle all of your senses. Though a bit touristic, walking through here is a neat way to soak in some of the culture. There are many great deals on food and shopping. Especially, on cosmetics and beauty products!"
79,4.0,"This area of inner Seoul is best known for women's beauty products but I enjoyed the street food more.  It was hardly bargain basement prices at KRW5000 for a small box of chicken and rice balls but since we insisted on freshly cooked, it was delicious.Appears to be a very safe area.  Easily accessible by Korail Seoul Metro Line 4."
80,4.0,Great place for cosmetics and popular clothing stores. Street Food also repeats and is ok. Fun cafes for coffee and desserts. And lots of bbq places.
81,4.0,"Told by others must go to do shopping. Yes you must go, the snacks, cosmetics and a very famous Michelin star Korean beef soup rice restaurant here. You can compare the price before you buy but I recommend one in the photo later. The beef soup rice is very authentic, it may be a home run business. The plain beef soup rice cost ¬•12000 Korean won for each. the side  dish of kimchi is unlimited supply. You pay and order before you get seats similar to any fast food restaurant. One thing is the Clinique facial cleanser at the Lotte duty free storey is cheaper than other duty free department store when you buy twin pack. But it is also available at the same price inside the airport at the gate 120 area. I must say only the Clinique brand  and I don‚Äôt know other brand There is also a five storey Daiso shop with many varieties than any other Daiso so far we have visited. Lots more to tell ..... so prepared your energy to spend a day there üëçüëçüëç. See below the photos of this shop, they have three shops within the district"
82,5.0,"When you look for a place to shop and eat , this is quite a place you need to go to check out first."
83,4.0,This place has many shopping malls. It has big department storw for who looking for elengant one. Even for young people. There are many alleys with non brands shops but quite well catch fashion people's intention. Many other cosmetetic shops as well. You can easily lost your way if you are keep walking. Please keep in mind there are a lot of turists and people who is calling you. If you want to visit quite and peaceful place this place is not for you. If you are looking for busy and comnercial area this is for you.
84,4.0,"We were in Seoul in December so Myeongdong Shopping Street(s) were festively lighted up in the evening. It is perpetually crowded with tourists. It's a haven for cosmetic, clothes and jewellery lovers and if you scout around, you may get good bargains. Lots of food vendors in the streets as well. Food is pricier here compared to the nearby Dongdaemun and Namdaemun markets. Nevertheless when in Seoul, you must at least experience shopping in Myeongdong Street.

They gave away bottles of gel and cream!)I went crazy with the food side stalls at Myeongdong as well only to realize that 5 mins walk away at Namdaemun market the same treats were sold at 1/3 the price!

124,4.0,this place is very good for shoppers and for those who would like to experience street foods in Korea. We also watched a funny show in this place where they use kitchen utensils as musical instruments. I would compare it to Ximending night market in Taiwan but more affordable.
125,5.0,Myeongdong is a must visit when you are in Seoul. It literally is a food & shoppers paradise! So many shops to visit and the variety of food is endless. Do go with an empty stomach so you can try all types of delicious food here. You should allocate at least 3 hours to walk around this area. The shops are endless and you can get lost.

131,5.0,During our stay we went here 3 times to shop. Its a shop till you drop area from restaurants to stalls and boutiques fro shoes and cosmetics. Cosmetic shops will offer you face mask and you just accept it and enter their shop without even buying or if you buy you just have to haggleü§£ . I would definitely recommend this area if you want to shop till you drop. Its just 2 stops from seoul station and actually accesible to all stops. They close by 11:00 pm every day .
132,5.0,"I love shopping in Myeongdong! My boys and I tried their street food and it was delish! The place kinda smelled different tho but it was fine, we had an awesome shopping experience. I wish we had more time spent there. Oh well, always a next time ü§û"

134,5.0,"Myeongdong is a place for not also for buying a beauty products but also for the delicious street food. We even tried the taiyaki, a fish-like cake with cheese filling inside."
135,5.0,"I love cosmetics and fashion. But I still wish that I had done more research. The area is very exciting-lots of tourists and shoppers. You can get really cute cheap clothes, tourist souvenirs and lots of knock off goods but the focus of this shopping area is cosmetics. With all of the instagrammable spots and street food it is a little bit difficult to actually shop for cosmetics unless you know better what you want. I suggest researching the main brands. innis free. Etude House, Stylenanda, skinfood, nature republic, Artium. These cosmetics houses have real deals that will translate into fun shopping if you know what you like and what products are truly not distributed world wide. Otherwise the appeal for most shoppers is the duty-free aspect. I personally don‚Äôt travel all around the world just to fill my bags with items that I can order on the internet or purchase otherwise paying a  reasonable tax for merchandise. Olive young is a fine place to buy more Korean cosmetics from the Lines you can find online. Personally I watched a lot of YouTube‚Äôs and researched which Korean brands have the least problematic additives preservatives. We figured out that both my daughter and I like ‚Äútoo cool for school‚Äù so we just two bought two of everything in the store that caught our eye and then let the staff give us lots of free samples of everything else.  I also bought a lot of dr. Jart masks at Olive young only to find that some of the other shops on the street offered Dr. jart masks discounted. There are young college students who volunteer as tour guides. They were standing in the major intersections. We talked for a long time with ‚Äú Zoe‚Äù who offered us lots of advice and friendly conversation about our travels even though we decided not to take tour. Furthermore we came back to one of the money exchange places closest to the walled embassy of China ( from the Lotte young plaza go down the street to the right of the Zara) more than once as it offered a significantly better daily rate of exchange. Myeongdong was a good place to find korean food.  Many good choices for desserts binsoo and chimaek and soups/stews. I would go elsewhere for bbq."
136,5.0,"Myeongdong is the place to be for skin care products. Prices varies from $1- $$$. Morning is better quality time for shopping, night time is  super pack with tourists, street food are awesomely yummy and bargain items are everywhere."

142,5.0,"We only went by in passing on our way to the ""Cookin' NANTA"" show, but wish we spent more time and was more hungry when we were there! We aren't really big shoppers when we travel, but it was interesting enough to window shop and is worth going for the food alone. It was busy and crowded when we went on a Sunday afternoon, but was clean and felt safe even with young children. Even people with food allergies (e.g. my wife is coeliac) should be able to find something they feel safe eating.Tip: apart from public transport, this is where we spent most of our cash in Korea - everywhere else we could use card. Bring at least 5000 won per person for a snack."
143,5.0,"For the ladies who love the Innisfree, Missha, Skinfood etc, this is the street you will be super motivated to come. The prices are cheaper, and even more when you buy in bulk.

It was a place with korean skincare everywhere, korean streetfood everywhere, and some branded stuff official stores too. It's a shopping heaven !But compare to Ewha and Itaewon, Myeongdong is lil bit more expensive. So be careful to spend your money in Myeongdong."

155,5.0,"We stayed in the heart of Myeongdong in Dec 18 and it was so convenient for shopping and trying different local food! We could actually run between different shops to compare prices, and return another day to make the actual purchase. Street food was fun to try as snacks for the first 2 days, but after that we had enough of them. Plenty of choices for proper sit down meals all around .. from BBQ, porridge, stews, etc ... just google the ""must try"" lists, read reviews and start work down from there."
156,4.0,"Great place if you like markets and cosmetics.  It‚Äôs busy and crowded, tons of little shops (some there 2 and 3 times, like Lush and Innisfree).  Mostly cosmetics, but also some good restaurants and great street food."

158,5.0,"I spent most of my time in Myeongdong shopping street. There are lots of eateries, it‚Äôs nice to have a quick bite and continue shopping. The ambience is nice especially at night when it gets busier, merrier and the street lights up beautifully. I recommend you all cosmetic lovers to shop at Baviphat cosmetic store as they sell cheap korean cosmetic products. It is an advantage for me since it is cheaper to buy my desired cosmetic products in Korea. Not only beauty care but also footwear and fashionable clothes."
159,4.0,"...though there are loads of other shops below street level (at the underground sections within Myeongdong station) and at the upper levels of each building. It‚Äôs easy to get distracted by the shopfront and promoters at street level who try to entice you with free samples to enter their premises. But learn to look up and check out the store signs where you will discover book stores, CD shops, non branded clothes shops, restaurants and even a meerkat cafe (yes, you heard me right....a cafe where there are real meerkats that come up close to you). The street resembles the hustle and bustle of streets in Asia except that you can feel a really young vibe here very much like Shinjuku in Tokyo. Loads of cosmetic brands (Tony Moly, Etude House, Innisfree....etc) each one trying to outsell each other by offering discounts or specials. Not surprising to see two outlets from the same brand just 100metres apart. This is also the place to get your K-pop merchandise fix where street carts and shops within Myeongdong station peddle all sorts of paraphernalia from key chains to posters to mugs sporting your favourite Korean pop idol. If you need to get stuff for family and friends (or even trendy clothes for your teen), this is the place to be with major shopping centres (Lotte, Shinsegae Department Stores). If you are in Korea during the winter/spring period, you will get to enjoy the Korean strawberries which are a real treat. Just don‚Äôt get them from the street carts along Myeongdong....You would probably get a better deal (almost half price) at Dongdaemun Market which is just a stop away on the Korean metro line."
160,5.0,"We simply can‚Äôt get enough of exploring Meyongdong shopping street (Go in the night time). There are far too many options to choose, from tons of restaurants, street food vendors and hundreds of shops selling all kinds of things. Apparently this is where most people shop for skin care products as well.Though I must say that this is a HIGHLY touristy place thus the prices are more on the higher side. That said, you have to check out the buzz this area creates in the evenings. It‚Äôs bustling with people from all parts of the world. A really cool place to hang out with kids. You can never have enough food here ! Try the Oreo Churros, Grilled Lobster, Baked cheese, sweet corn, Skewered Potatoes, Beef, baked scallops, etc. yummy !!! It‚Äôs quite a gastronomic experience.Typical street food snacks cost upwards of US$5 (5000 KWR). Happy eating & exploring !"
161,5.0,"We stayed 5 nights at Metro Hotel Myeongdong. The best place if we go for eat and shopping with teenagers. There are many streetfoods around the streets every 4pm until night. We just walked 5min from hotel to find the streetfoods and so many cosmetic store in myeongdong. Ettude, Innisfree, Faceshop, Tonimolly, Olive Young, etc. Odeng = Fish Cake = 2000 won, Pork Barbeque = 6000 won, Tornado potato = 3 or 4000 wonWe also ate Korean fried chicken such as BHC = 18000 won for 1 package = 9 drumsticks.

170,4.0,"This is a shopping haven for sure for those who love shopping! I may not just have explored the entire place but the stores closed earlier than I expected (around 10pm). I thought they would be open as late as 2am or so. So keep that in mind if you planned on shopping pretty late at night!I also noticed the prices are a bit expensive here - that's why it was called one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world! So definitely check the other areas in Seoul if you plan to do a lot of shopping because other places like Dongdaemun, Ehwa and Hongdae were a little cheaper!"

It is difficult to really take in the sights and enjoy the experience, and you have to do the best you can.It does seem like a fabulous Street though and would not discourage anybody from visiting. Just be smart about it.The Street Food is good and a good variety. Worth visiting for just the street food.

I hated shopping here, much preferred Gangnam area , same shops but calmer and easier to buy."

183,5.0,This place is the heart of Seoul for us. Shops closes late till 10 pm so after our land tour we can still shop and eat street foods which Myeongdong offers a lot. That‚Äôs why I always choose hotel right here in Myeongdong.
184,3.0,Many varieties of retail outlets and and good food outlets after a tiring shopping. The retail assistant gives good service too.
185,4.0,"Tonnes of shops for indoor shopping and sales ongoing. Also what makes the place buzzing are the rows of stalls outside selling street food, clothing, etc."
186,4.0,"The area was rife with shopping and food and ranged from household names such as Daiso to a huge North Face store. There were sports shops at nearly every turn eg JD sports, Adidas, Nike etc to small stores that sold SGD 1 pair of socks.  There are arty stationery shops, massage and nail spas, confectionery stores and lots of shops selling face products  from oatmeal face masks to brightening face masks. What was fascinating was the vibrant night life. The area came to life at night with food stores selling butter garlic scallops, beef balls, twisted potato chips, fried pancakes and waffles etc. The list and selection of foods boggled the mind. You just could not eat enough and there was so much interesting foods to try and sample. It was admittedly a little steep in price but it really depended on whether you ordered a chicken fried corn sausage or a buttered lobster. Really worth a visit."
187,5.0,"Lots of reasonably priced tax-free merchandise (maybe because we went during the holidays) in a wide variety. Street food abounds, too! Must experience!"

Lots of street food, it is a must try when in Seoul. All the food are simply delicious. It‚Äôs pretty busy here but a few of the roads are closed off to vehicles from 10am to 11pm, so if u have young children just be mindful else the place is pretty safe and tourist friendly. The traders can communicate in simple English and i was kinda surprise that many of them speaks mandarin too. Love this place and look forward to our next visit."
189,4.0,"If its cosmetics, clothing and shoes that one is looking for, look no further. We were here on Christmas day and the narrow streets were literally shoulder-to-shoulder walking space. Not enough space to stretch out your hands let alone swing a cat!Cosmetics are cheap (So says my wife). Its worth a walk thru and there are lots of street food vendors around."
190,5.0,"If you enjoy a crowded street market type atmosphere with lots to see, hear and taste, then you should enjoy this area. Lots of stores and stalls, the area is a bit of a maze that you can wander around. Stall prices are ok but not the best (example, Dongdaemon‚Äôs Migliore have generally better pricing). Easily accessible by Myeongdong Station."
191,4.0,"If you would like to pick up different type of cosmetic products, this is one stop for all. Do note that the push cart on the streets are retailing more expensive than the underground stalls. You can also pick up a map so that its easy to move around. Can spend easily half a day here."

201,4.0,It‚Äôs a tourist destination. Lots of street vendors. Food and stuff. Mainly tourists but a good place to soak in the culture and atmosphere. We sent the kids to the arcade while the adults shopped. Arcade‚Äôs great. Payable by the hour with some free games for young children. Lots of virtual reality stuff.
202,3.0,Nice shopping street and eateries. Beware of PICKPOCKETS. Wife was targeted.  Swift and fast when the culprit/s would blend in the crowds. Have all your pockets tightly buttoned. My friend was a victim too last year.
203,3.0,"Before my trip to Myeongdong, I read that it is like the Orchard Road of Singapore. I was there the week before last and found it to be more like Bugis instead. It was not a good time to visit South Korea at this time of the year. The biting cold made street shopping unbearable and undesirable.  Anyway, the shops are repetitive and the street food pricey.  And although there are many cafes, the quality and vibes did not meet my expectation. The people there are also generally less pleasant.Twosome Place seems to be the local version of Starbucks. Huge place with nice and cozy seating areas but the cakes are not the same as those from Starbucks. The Paris Baguette in South Korea isn‚Äôt quite the same as the one here. I had intended to have my daily breakfast at Paris Baguette but ended up spending every morning at Tous les Jours instead. The latter offers a variety of interesting and palatable bread and pastries. A little more pricey though - a bun and a cuppa sets you back about S$8/9.Do make a point to eat their Ginseng Chicken stuffed with rice in chicken broth.  I had it at the first and original restaurant near City Hall Station Exit 10.As for the touted Korean Fried Chicken or Chimaek, I tried Kyochon (Sinchon) and Twotwo Chicken (Myeongdong). I must say I prefer Kyochon. It was good and slightly less pricey than Twotwo. The chicken are fresher too. For ladies, it‚Äôs probably a haven for all sorts of mostly low to mid range beauty and skin care products. I feel that Myeongdong is a little overhyped but if you enjoy the vibes of bright lights, and the sound and sight of being in the crowd then you‚Äôd probably like this place. As for me, just once is sufficient. If you have been to Japan, then you might want to manage your expectation a little just so that you will be able to see Korea in a more positive light. What surprised me was that, other than beauty products and clothings, things and especialy food, including street food, generally cost more than those in Japan."
204,5.0,Lots of shopping and Food streets with many stalls. lots of tourists and locals.  Can find almost everything there.  Open till 10+ and absolutely loved if
205,5.0,"I spent so much money there .. the street food in the evening was amazing and the shops came alive at night, it was like two different places during the day it's a normal town .. a fair few people going about their day. . And night/evening it becomes a hustle and bustling place with thousands descending on the streets, it was amazing to be there while the Christmas lights were lit. Truely is a have to be there to understand the two different faces of seoul. Without a doubt I'm going back very soon"
206,4.0,"This place appears to be a ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù.  There are many stores here selling clothing, etc.  There are also many eateries and street food in the evening. The place is so vibrant and crowded with both locals and tourists. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul."

Beauty products everywhere cheap and many mask gifts if you buy. And also socks with many designs with 1000won. If you can't find places you can ask Tourist person there. At Ishadong sell key chain, magnet and handmade bags inside and outside the building. Please buy wood spoons and others made from original wood and beautiful. At Namdaemon market sell brooch, shirts with comfortable price but I think closed 5.30. Please book on line to Nami Island and Everland, it's cheap. Beautiful area for family and couple."
209,4.0,"Huge shopping area with shops selling beauty products and fashion stuff.  Generally beauty products are cheaper than back home.  Also a wide variety of local Korean products that women (and some men) just love to get their hands on. Be prepared for lots of walking with little chances for sitting unless u are having a meal in one of those many restaurants dotted around the place.There's also many street food stall, but mind you, they are franchised, so much repetition.Access to the place mainly via Myeongdong station.   Close proximity to Shinsaegae Departmental Store and Lotte Departmental Store."
210,4.0,"Cosmetics valley.Foods be it street foods, restaurants or just a cafe's. Looking for Korean Seaweed, they have KMart."
211,5.0,"Walking along Myeong-dong Street, the first thing we would notice is the food stalls selling mouthwatering street food. We went there on a weekend and there were lots of people. But, as a family with kids (we were even using a stroller), we were able to maneuver easily. We tried almost all the food they sold. And they all tasted good! Just for you to have an ideo of how much the food are, here are the food prices i remember: takoyaki with baby octopus is 5,000 won, vegetable omelette is 3,000 won, lobster with cheese is 15,000 won, and their soft serve ice cream is 2,000 won .

212,5.0,"Myeong to the Dong! Wow! The single word that could describe this place - wow. From the signage on the road which marks the entrance of the shopping area I was already trapped in its ambiance. I've read and watched a lot of blogs and vlogs about Myeongdong before coming to Korea. So seeing it in actual is really something. Street foods lined both sides of the road along with different stalls of souvenir items, shoes, socks, chestnuts and all sort of things. Shopping buildings and restaurants are also everywhere. It seems like a never ending stretch because it extends horizontally and vertically. I really loved shopping for souvenirs there because its cheap! Also the selection of food is really nice from hotteok to gyeranpang to odeng. Along with friend chicken with tteok etc.It's truly a heaven for foodies and shoppers. Great place to visit!"
213,4.0,"Very crowded during day or night. Many store selling cosmetics and beauty products. Street foods are more expensive compare to Hongdae, dongdaemun and namdaemun. Overall a very good experience to spend sometime here."

215,5.0,"This is a very famous shopping street, great varieties of street food, mouth watering food, shops for great shopping experience"
216,4.0,Myeongdong is a very busy area. Good place to eat and shop. It‚Äôs very crowded but it‚Äôs worth a trip.
217,5.0,Walking along the streets during the winter nights among the many street vendors selling different delicacies invokes excitement. The market is different fr the ones in SG.  Beauty and branded sports shops and cafes lining up the streets adds on to the exciting atmosphere. There‚Äôs something foreveryone!
218,5.0,"Ranging from 3000Won to 8, this street is the ultimate experience on street food. Too bad no blood sausage or other traditional stuff seen in KD dramas but I think this is the best place to start. Foreigner friendly and accessible.Toilet is in one of the malls unless you are dining in a restaurant... clean but a bit out of the way, so try not to drink too much :)"
219,5.0,"Myeong-dong is Seoul‚Äôs shopping mecca and is a must-see for tourists, but it is not just a shopping destination; Myeong-dong is also a hub of commerce, banking and culture with a daytime population of 1.5-2 million. For shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire, as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices.  Myeong-dong is very popular with international visitors and fills with Japanese and Chinese tourists during the holiday period known as ‚ÄúGolden Week‚Äù which takes place in spring and is called golden week due to the week-long holiday period that takes place in Japan and China. Part of Myeong-dong‚Äôs popularity stems from relatively affordable prices here, especially compared to the other shopping meccas of Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong."
220,4.0,I think there is full of review here! I am glad I stay here and we enjoy very much! Everything you need is just walking distance. Something to take note is that Korea subway it's just not very kids friendly if you have a stroller. Will be a nightmare for you!
221,5.0,"Firstly the underground station Myeongdong houses a huge shopping mall.The area is filled with a huge assortment of food shops, shops selling clothes, cosmetics and to numerous things to list.Great street food and the whole area just buzzes with excitement.Restaurants and entertainment are plentiful.A must on your list of places to see."
222,4.0,"This place offers various stores. A lot of beauty shops most especially. Offers a variety of street food! My fave part, just wish there were trash cans cuz so many people would leave there trash. So many people, if you're claustrophobic and you just hate crowds, not a place for you. But if you love shopping and food, definitely worth it! Lots of cafes to getaway from the crowd from time to time when shopping."
223,4.0,Myeongdong definitely a must do. Clothing and food really affordable and the atmosphere is fabulous anything you want you can get.
224,2.0,"For me, I will not buy or eat at Myeongdong shopping street, I rather walk a few hundred metres away to Namdaemun Market to shop and eat.The different of the prices are 2000-3000 won for eating in a shop.And you can still bargain for shoes,clothing and idols merchandise stuffs here at Namdaemun.But of course if you want branded things you should go to Myeongdongüòä"
225,4.0,Myeongdong is not just a shopping area for beauty products but  known for its street food.  We taste various street food at pricey amount.  Some store give free face mask but others if you dnt purchase any in their store they will get again the face mask
226,3.0,this place is noisy and busy and colourful at night.  Hawkers set up portable carts on the pedestrianized street.  Lots of street snacks but prices are ridiculous.  6500W for a juiced promegranate! 25000W for a pack of strawberries.
227,5.0,"Myeongdong was the first place we went immediately after we checked-in from our accommodation, as it was so popular Seoul destination among tourists. Since it was a Friday, there were many tourists and there were lines of different street foods which are yumny and appetizing. Hence, we tried some of those and they were delicious but a little pricey compared to some delicious street foods we have here in the Phil. Shopping is fun as there were great items specially beauty and skin care products, where stores give lots of samples when you purchase. Tourists get to enjoy tax refund when you present your passport. Restaurants are all over, hence you can't go hungry while shopping. We had so much fun and enjoyable experience in Myeongdong when we splurged some money we saved for our Seoul trip. It's a happy place which we would definitely go back to in Seoul."
228,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Great food, great value $$ shopping, fanastic beautiful autum scenery and safe environmental local exploration.. üòçüíï"
229,4.0,"Was there almost everyday on all of our stay in Seoul for past 8days, really lively shopping streets and like never ending fun and excitment. altho most shop selling same stuff, like cosmetic and accessories, the other street vendor does provide another revenue of excitment. theres a middle lane that sells food, of all kinds, but personally felt the price was steeper than other place, so we just try soe on our first day, like cheese lobster, garlic prawns (fav), pancakes, promogrenate drink, mixed friut drink, 21cm ice cream etc. but the most interesting is the small lane after that eat street that turns into another lane of chicken & beer joints, that feature 5-6 joint in one lane, plus DTF and 2 other western cafe, so we chose 1 on each day, do try out the 678 chicken, BHC and TwoTwo. oh and dun be afraid to que, coz its fast going."
230,4.0,"Myeongdong must be the busiest street I have ever visited in Seoul. There were so many tourists and locals. Eating your street food might be quite a challenge especially with a stroller in tow because there's almost nowhere to stop.There are many shops, street food stalls, restaurants. It is good to sample the food here but the prices are more expensive than in Hongik or in Ehwa."
231,4.0,"If you have been to one market in Korea you have been to them all. Don't get me wrong it is fun and a wonderful experience, however, they are all much the same. A ton of people, food, and your typical carts. The food is wonderful and you can get some good prices on things."
232,5.0,I enjoy staying in Myeongdong. Hang out and try lots of food along the walk.My friends said that you can get lots of sample of beauty product when you walk in Myeongdong Street . Actually it is not really true.The way they gave you their product promotion is like not sincere. They ask you to enter the shop not just giving away the product to try. I dont really like the way . I dont really need the beauty product anyway heehehehehhe.
233,4.0,"One can find all types of cosmetics here as well as tonnes of local restaurants, cafes and a few western restaurants. There are also street food stalls mainly open at night."
234,4.0,This area is food and shopping haven.  Besides the street foods there are also lots of cafes and restaurants around.  Lots of different brands of cosmetics to choose from.  Each stores have their own ways to lure people inside to do some shopping in one way or another.  Lots of cosmetic brands have more than one outlets.  it seems like they are all over the place.  Most tourist never miss this place when visiting Seoul.  It's like a must visit place when you are in the area.  Just bring lots of cash because it's hard to resist the aroma of foods.
235,4.0,"If you love cosmetics, then this is paradise for you. But what if you don't care about cosmetics? The street food will come to your rescue. The food stalls start setting up as early as 2pm. Either way, cosmetics or street food, be prepared to shell out a lot of money. Cosmetics are cheaper here but you will be tempted to buy everything that the salesladies offer to you. The top of my hand where they slather samples of the moisturizers, swatches of makeup, actually misses all the attention it got there. As to the street food, you think you're getting a bargain just having it for dinner. But before you know it, you've bought from 5 stalls and spent 30,000 won trying everything out. Good luck if your accommodation is in this area. You'll be broke by the middle of the week. Thank goodness I can charge the cosmetics to my credit card."

246,4.0,"Come here to get your fix of cosmetics, skincare, street foods! Full of tourists so there are also plenty of restaurants around here. But now, the skincare brand shops like Tony Moly, The Saem, etc are so pushy where if you take the free mask that they offered on the street, they literally push you into the shop :(So rude.

There usually are only a few vehicles traveling slowing amongst the crowd. There were many street food vendors when we were there, but I personally was not too impressed with the quality of the food.

273,5.0,"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to Seoul, we stayed within 15 minutes walk form Myeongdong and I have to say it was fantastic!  The area has all the large high end fashion boutiques and department stores (Lotte Department Store) you could ever want as well as a huge range of high street stores, some I knew some I did not.  In addition to this the array of food eateries was wonderful!  I have to say that hand on heart my most favorite part was the street food vendors that set up every afternoon and are there until the wee small hours.  Absolutely amazing range of food to choose form and the smells as you pass the sweet and savory selections are wonderful.  My son and I went there one evening to just try everything we could in place of going out for dinner.  I highly recommend Tornado Potatoes and he particularly loved the Octopus and Lobster food stalls. I am going back again early next year as I had the best time!"
274,5.0,"We stayed at Namsan Guest house at Exit 3. Myeongdong Shopping Street was located at exit 6 and 7. There were many cosmetics shops like Nature republic, innnisfree and many more. We bought bundle aloe vera and masks with reasonable price. A must visit place were Artbox, Line friends and Lala Mart. We watched Nanta Show at Unesco building.The people with red shirts were there at the entrance to help you with the direction. There were many food stalls. Most of all for muslims, find the Busan Jib restaurant at the alley (trademark ABC mart and Apple signboard). We tried a lot of street food like tall ice cream, spiral potato, egg bread, gimbap and red bean fish cake."

If you are intimidated by crowds, this might be a bit much, but we LOVED it! Most interesting street foods included scallops grilled with cheese, grilled octopus and squid, and tasty eggs grilled inside a small toast slice."
277,4.0,"This is a good place for shopping in Seoul City. We all know that as tourists we are looking for places where we can find a wide variety of goods to buy, and Myeongdong street is a must go for tourists. Here you will find many international and Korean clothing stores like Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Adidas and more, or if you are looking for the latest trend in Korean skincare and beauty products this is the right place for you. You might have heard how important appearance is in South Korea. Make a stop in Myeondong street and treat yourself by buying some good Korean skincare products. Here you can go into the skincare and beauty shops and you can get free samples, and if you are lucky enough the staff of these stores will let you try the products on site.In Myeongdong you can find food although. International and Korean restaurants are everywhere, but one of the most popular foods in this area is the street food. I highly recommend you to come to Myeongdong street after 4:00 pm, you will see street vendors taking their small food trucks out and you'll find them in the main street and alleys. Bring some cash with you because you won't be able to pay with your card if you want to buy their food, I think that most of the prices of the food are reasonable but I am gonna dare to say that some others look a bit expensive compared to what they are selling."
278,4.0,"If you want skin or beauty products, this is the place to visit.Opens till 9-10 pm, lot of bargain products.Most of the brands are available."
279,4.0,"Very crowded street, full of shopping, particularly full of shops that sell beauty products, Innisfree, Clio, Etude house, skinfood, u name it they have it. When it is evening, the whole street become alive with all the street stalls set up, but personally I find it expensive. An egg bread costs 2000 won, a beef cube stock costs 7000 won, a stick with rice cake and sausage cost 4000 won. A fish cake cost 2000 won. There are also shops selling clothes, socks and accessories. You can also find theme cafe like cat cafe, also other cafes like coin cafe, osulloc tea house. There are many popular restaurants here as well, like running man haha bbq shop, wangbijib bbq as well. The underground mall at Myeongdong Station, you can also shop over there."
280,5.0,This is a must visit! The place is packed full of street food and shopping outlets. Coffee shops of course are there so there are lots to choose from. There can be lots of people in that street and on a hot day may be uncomfy to some especially if you have a baby or a toddler. Better go there on the late afternoon so it's not too hot.

284,3.0,"This is a shopping heaven especially for street food, cosmetics, clothing and shoes. You will find many shops packed during Saturdays. However, we had a bad experience where we were cheated by food seller who asked us to pay twice, once during the ordering and they made us pay again when the food was prepared. We were shocked that there was such a petty ""thief"" among those sellers who use this trick to get more money from foreign visitors."

287,5.0,"If you are looking for a cool shopping experience, go to this market area. Check beforehand for the hours as sometimes it changes."
288,4.0,"I love cosmetic, so this is heaven for me. I was there in August which was too hot n humid to shop during day time. Stores have AC but I prefer to shop at night time especially they have street food. Foods are not cheap IMO. And I am not sure if we are suppose to bargain for beauty supplies? Because I feel they are not that cheap compare to if I order online. Most store lures you with deals like buy 2 get 1 free and throw in bunch of samples. Or if you buy 500k krw they give you a small carry on, 1 million krw they give you a medium luggage to carry your purchase (I think that‚Äôs a great idea). And you see lots of people carry luggages around. I wish they have a beauty supply store where they sell beauty machine like derma pen, needle roller, LED light, etc.. .. because I couldn‚Äôt find one. Oliver young has blackhead removal machine but it is weak. I bought and tried once I got back to the State. It didn‚Äôt work well. Otherwise I highly recommend going to myeongdong shopping street."
289,4.0,This is really a wonderful shopping place... you get all sort of brands and bargains... Also there are many eateries to choose from... A must place to visit..

293,5.0,"you can find in this place the different South Korean cosmetics brands such as innisfreeworld, etude house, nature republic, etc. and they give a lot of ""service"" which are gifts for whatever you buy such as free face masks, anti aging products and others which I use whenever I travel. There are also street food but I have not tried."
294,5.0,"A must-go place for tourists. On the first day, you can come here for money exchange. Many shops with better rate than other places of Seoul but the best one is still the one the opposite of the embassy, although very minor than the better one in Myeongdong.  On the last day, you can do shopping for  comestic or sports shoes. Anytime you  can come here for food with famous restaurants. They may not be the best but are above average."
