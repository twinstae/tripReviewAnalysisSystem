1,4.0,"Interesting museum to visit. However, the Asian stars doesn't look as realistic. We had fun playing with the interactive games though."
2,5.0,"We went there on Monday  and I was surprised there was literally no other visitors but us. Around 4-5 people arrived later. Except taking photos you can also participate in some games at the museum which was kind of fun I think. They take your pics and send it to you via email later on. Also, the regular ticket price was 18kWon but you can get 10% discount if you pay with MasterCard."
3,4.0,"Free admission with the Seoul Pass. I only spent an hour snapping pictures with K-POP stars, Trump, Obama, etc political leaders around the world"
4,4.0,"You can take pictures with live size famous people including Korean stars here. Interestingly, there are interactive stuff like piloting a plane so the whole experience wasn't just for picture moments."
5,3.0,Positives: we came in the afternoon and there were no crowds. We practically had the entire place to ourselves.Also there were a few interactive game exhibits where u can either play solo or with a friend.Negatives:There wasn't that many exibhits (only 3 floors) and some of them don't really look like the real person.I can't imagine spending more than 1-1.5 hours here. You can probably go though the entire place within 1 hour.
6,5.0,"It is definitely not the biggest (see MT), but delightfully the funnest wax museum encounter I have hade all over world. We did not intend to go, but given it was across from hotel dropped by, wow. The staging of the scenes adds so much fun, and even though we did not know many of K Celebs,  we quickly figured out their significance. If you have visited other  wax museums, you have to try this one in Seoul and discover a whole new immersive experience :)"
7,5.0,"A must see in Seoul. Very well done and popular, visiting on a week day would be better as it attracts large crowds. Well laid out with a large array of waxworks done by a French company. Children and teenagers were laughing and enjoying the people depicted."

9,5.0,Fun wax museum where you get to take pictures with celebrities. Will recommend to come here when you're in Korea
10,5.0,"A great place to take friends and your family to see your favourite celebrities!!! If you’re looking to do something after a nice day of shopping in the shopping district definitely make a trip here, you won’t regret it."
11,4.0,"Yeah, the wife thinks they might just come to life and jump out at her.  She is frightened easily.  We happened across this place.  It is multi-level, but after about an hour and 2 floors, we wanted to leave.  It's not that bad.  We were just tired.  You'd probably spend about 90 minutes here on average.  Some of the wax figures are really well done and some are just not done well.  But there is a great variety and some things are interactive and worth some cool photos.I was not busy when we there in the middle of the week."
12,5.0,We spent around an hour inside. Place contains 4 floors so there is much to see. If you have a MasterCard they offer a 10% discount. Highly recommend to visit.
13,5.0,The figures were very realistic and I loved how each room had a different theme. Me & my husband really enjoyed our visit!
14,4.0,We finished it in about an hour but the interesting thing about this place compared to the other wax museum I've been to in sydney is that they have lots of interactive activities to do in comparison
