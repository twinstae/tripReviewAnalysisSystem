0,4.0,"But pretty small. With the audio guide no need to spend more then an hour. Part of the palace pass, which contains five palaces. Come early to see the changing of the guards, but dont enticipate something ""european"""
1,2.0,"We ventured here for the free rental of Hanbok, and the changing of guards performance:Changing of Guards ceremony 11:00(1st Time) / 14:00(2nd Time) / 15:30(3rd Time)Closed on Mondays.We queued for the Hanbok at 1300, as the sign stated that the counter will be opened at 1330.The counter eventually opened at 1345, with crowds over-powering the queue.  We voiced out to the crowd and the attending lady in charge.  Yet, the lady in charge replied that she only attends to the people who approached her first, regardless of the queue.  Hence, we voiced out to the crowd that there was queue and be sensible to those who have waited for 45mins.  We were lucky as the crowd were English speakers and they take heed to our comments.Beware of the lady attending to you, she was rude and abrupt.Well....  we were here for the Hanboks, just swallow what her comments were."
2,3.0,"Dropped by here because it was on our way, and walked the grounds. A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are picture-worthy, as usual. Otherwise, not much to see here, but if it's on your way it's worth stopping by."
3,3.0,A combination of Korean & Western-Styled Palace which makes me opened up my eyes 👀 Wonderful place to relax
4,4.0,"This was our first ‘self’ tour of the Deoksugung Palace. Interestingly the entrance fee was waived for the next few days, we got lucky. We also witnessed a demonstration right outside the palace. Lots of Korean and US flags. The palace ground is quite bare and brownish, I guess in winter it doesn’t look it’s best. What was interesting to do was play a few ancient sports that are on display and we made full use of trying some of the ancient games. The palace has an interesting mix of traditional Korean and Colonial style architecture.The law with the fountain area looks really nice and the Museum of Art is quite an interesting (albeit boring for kids) exhibition. It was a nice day to be out and about as the sun was shining bright on a cold crisp winter day. Worth a visit, check the box!"
5,4.0,We went Deoksugung Palace to see the changing guard ceremony at 11am ( only 15min ). First we went to the hanbok counter to get the free hanbok. We can choose the hanbok and we can wear it for photo around the gate for 10min. We took many pictures with the free hanbok.
6,5.0,"Standing in the middle of one of the busiest city junctions, a visit to this place can be clubbed with that of City Hall. This Palace is considered one among the five grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty. Located near the City Hall Metro station, this Palace complex houses a very well maintained garden, the National Art Museum influenced by the Western Architecture along with other traditional structures.The changing of guard ceremony is also held in this palace which is another major attraction for visitors."
7,3.0,"Arrived at this palace 15 minutes before the changing guard ceremony. What i can suggest, please pick a spot facing the gate as usually this side can get a first chance to take a pic with the guards and no crowd yet ;-)  One more thing, if you go inside the palace, for senior citizen (>65y.o) is free."
8,5.0,"We went to see the changing of guards at 11 am. Very interesting ceremony, a loud English voice explains what is happening and afterwards pictures can be taken with the guards. Kids loved it too (6&4 yo); good to go 10-15 min before start to get a spot at the ropes.The palace and its garden are great to walk through. We visited on the last Wednesday of the month and it was free including the museum entered from the garden (some really interesting pieces). All in all a very entertaining morning."
9,4.0,"The Palace ground is huge where the palaces of each dynasty are spread over the whole area with the rock walls.interesting history of the palace and also the nice change-of-guards ceremony at the main gate.Good place to visit if one goes for a walking tour with City Hall, Arts Museum, Presidential Palace, the Stream and Insadong... for a day.the Palace entry tickets are definitely cheap and worth the 1-2hrs walkabout."
10,4.0,"Since this is the only Seoul palace you can see illuminated at night, we walked through the Seoullo Sky Garden on both ends (blue lights come on) and then over to this palace nearby.  It was beautiful to behold at night."
11,5.0,We had a private tour of this site and it was amazing. Beautiful buildings and gardens. The art gallery was the highlight with historical and modern Korean art on display. Nice to see original Korean artworks.
12,3.0,"Korea Palace is all the same, You visited one and the rest is about the same, only the history is different."
13,4.0,"It was Sunday, a quick explore to Seoul Cityhall area landed us at this palace. We had a free english tour by youth professionals offering a good explanation of the palace. Only available on weekends. Look out for them dressed in orange."
14,4.0,This is one of my favorite palaces in Seoul. I like that the palace is surrounded by modern buildings. It’s like a little part of history in the city. The changing of the guard ceremony is really cool too.
15,3.0,"On a brief visit to Seoul earlier this year we visited the Deoksugung Palace. It is a collection of buildings some dating back to the sixteenth century, that have survived wars and some dismantling by the Japanese last century. Some of the buildings seem to have been restored while other have the foundations only. The grounds were neat and well maintained."
16,3.0,"Unless you cannot visit Gyeongbokgung Palace or Changdeokgung Palace, do not bother to visit here, as it is a very small palace."
17,3.0,This is a smaller palace and area. Very pretty if you want a smaller experience than Gyeongbokdung palace.
18,5.0,"This is smaller palace compared to Gyeongbokung, but thats the reason why it has some additional coziness and charm. Entrance ticket cost is almost nothing, so do not overlook this palace. The ""new palace"" is closed to the public but one can sign in advance and then entry is free. Gardens are very good and tranquil.Recommended"
19,5.0,Another beautiful palace where we happen to came across a reenactment of a Korean coronation ceremony. The grounds are very pretty too.
20,5.0,"Deoksugung has a different character compared to the other well-known Korean palaces like Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung. For me, this is mostly because of the mix of Eastern buildings next to Western buildings which are greatly influenced by neoclassical architectural styles. Deoksugung is also softer and feels less imposing than Gyeongbukgung, possibly due to the less extensive grounds.I visited Deoksugung in the cherry blossom season and it was lovely, especially in the sunset and as the lights started to come on. Deoksugung is the only palace that is open until 9pm all year round, allowing you the opportunity of walking in palace compound at twilight. It's pretty amazing to feel that you've been transported back several hundred years only to look up and see a modern building or sign in the distance.If you're not fond of mingling with the tourist crowd but yet wanted to visit a Korean palace, Deoksugung is ideal for its size, location (right next to City Hall) and character."
21,5.0,I decided to visit this palace quite last minute and was impressed by the architecture inside it (East meets West). The change of guard ceremony was a lot more impressive than the one at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss it!
22,4.0,Last palace i visit when i in south korea and this palace near from Seoul City Hall you just need cross the street to go to Seoul City Hall
23,3.0,"This was the last of the palaces I visited on the combination ticket. And I think only the changing of the guard ceremony was good. They have a few timings per day, so do check the schedule and watch it. Quite worth the spectacle. We caught the 3:30pm one. As we were early, we managed to join in the ceremony in traditional clothing. There's a booth at the side with free clothing available to try on. If you don't join in the ceremony, you can try the clothing for 3 min to take photos. It's free! Why not? Usual hanbok rentals start from 10,000₩ for 2 hours. The rest of the palace wasn't as nice as the others I went to, I feel. It also had some western style buildings built when Korea was trying to modernize. Abit odd. The inside of the colonial looking ""palace"" building can also be viewed but only 5 foreigners a day can enter with a reservation but the website doesn't load. I tried asking the counter staff but they said no, it's full already but Koreans could enter. Oh well. The plus point is that, if you want to visit a Korean palace and you can only do so after 4 or 5pm, this is the only one that is open, so you can enjoy this palace grounds in the evening. And it's only 1000₩ to enter. Cheap. Especially if you have no time for the other palaces, don't have to get the combination ticket."
24,5.0,"Nice collection of palaces, both ancient and modern, eastern and western. Quite small compared to other palaces, but well worth visiting as so unique, making great photographic  juxtapositions. If visiting on the weekend, go up to Jeonddong Observatory beforehand so as to get a birdseye view in advance."
25,4.0,"A nice architecture and you can also experience the guard changing ceremony here. However there are certain timing of when this ceremony will take place so you will need to do a bit of research. (went for 11am ceremony). To go here, take subway to City Hall (Line 1 or 2) Exit 2."
26,4.0,A very small Palace but the Royal guard changing ceremony is good. It's the only Palace that has both Korean and western buildings. Same as Gyeongbokgung  if u wants to watch the Guard changing ceremony the time will clash with the guided tour so can only choose one.
27,4.0,"Came to visit Deoksugung Palace as well as to witness the changing of guards ceremony, which was done thrice a day at 11am, 2pm and 330pm. Entrance ticket is attractively priced at 1k₩ for adult and 500₩ for child. The changing of guards ceremony is very spectacular. However, there is only Korean and Chinese narration provided during the ceremony, thus may have to read up the before the visit to fully appreciate. Overall, a good way to immerse the Korean history after days of city shopping."
28,5.0,Nice place full of autumn Colours. 1000 won for a good walk in the palace.  Not as big as the Gyeongbukgong palace so the walk is not as tiring.
29,3.0,วันที่ไปถึง มีการแสดงขบวนทหารย้อนยุค ด้านใน ไม่กว้างขวางมากนัก แต่ก็มีสถาปัตยกรรมที่สวยงามโดดเด่นพอให้ได้ชมThis palace is not quite great but has many beautiful architectural building.
30,3.0,"A visit to this palace gives the visitors a quick taste of the old times Korea of what it would have been. This palace comes complete with a regular show of the changing of the guards out the front about three times a day. The guards are part of the show rather than actual guards protecting the palace. There are quite a few ancient buildings which have been reconstructed, along with fountain & statues around the peaceful ground. Tip: We spent an hour wandering the ground to pass time, but a good tip would be to save some time to try on the free Traditional Korean costume dress up right outside the front for some photo opportunity. We found out too late that this great tourist experience was just outsider (and complimentary) when our tour bus arrived for the pick up."
31,4.0,"I choose to see the changing guard ceremony in smaller palace because less people than in bigger palace like Gyeongbokgung palace and it's more comfortable for me since travelling with a baby.It was more than I expected.The ceremony was great. I can watch whole ceremony without difficulty because I am not that tall. They asked foreigner to hit the gong and asked them to wear hanbok during the ceremony.They were also hanbok free to wear near the ceremony area. You can wear them for free. But not all tourist is permitted, they see how tall you are so their hanbok is not being walked on hanbok."
32,3.0,"We visited this palace in the afternoon on returning from a tour in Seoul. We realised that the museum was closed at 5pm, and unfortunately did not get time to revisit. The palace stands out in the middle of the city, as it is surrounded by modern buildings in the City hall area.We had an opportunity to walk the garden and view the architecture. This is the only palace where western style (russian) architecture may be found. This palace is also known as the west palace.The palace may be reached by subway line 1 City Hall, and exit # 2. It is open from 9am - 9pm, but closed on Mondays.Admission is W1,000 for adults and W500 for students. There are free english tours at 10:30am and 1/;30pm, and the changing of the guard ceremony is at 11am, 2pm and 3:30pm.This palace assumed importance after the Imjin wars (Japanese Invasions) in the 16th century. As the Japanese had burnt most of the seoul city gates and palaces, the King decided to live here until the main palace was repaired.The russian style buildings to the North of the palace compound, were built between 1900-1910, and there is a belief that there are secret passages from the palace grounds to the russian embassy. The pond and fountain in  front of the russian buildings is beautiful, and there is a hemispherical sundial that was invented in 1434.I hope to visit the palace again to see the changing of the guard, and experence the museum."
33,4.0,The palace complex comprises of many buildings (halls). It is so close to the City Hall subway station. The entrance fee is only KW1000 (very minimal isn't it?). The place is like a mini park and it would be nice to just sit down and relax there. The guards look interesting with their traditional dress. Ask the information center about the time for change of guard. It's unique and worth waiting for.
34,3.0,"This palace was just 5min from our hotel, so was able to visit in the morning before our departure. They have a changing of the guards that we just happened to be lucky with our arrival time (11am or so). The palace is not so large but there is an art museum inside, some nice gardens with blossoms (April)."
35,5.0,"As it was quite near our hotel, this was first. We chanced upon a Changing of the Guards ceremony and it was quite interesting and the colors were fascinating. We toured during the MERS scare and there were not a lot of tourists around. Our photos were quite nice as it appeared like we were the only ones around. it's a small palace and it's something you can quickly finish up in an hour or two."
36,5.0,Stayed about 2 hours which about tested the limits of a 3yo. Nice microcosm to see what a Korean palace is like without having to travel too far and having to feel obliged to walk the extensive grounds of a bigger palace like changdeokgung
37,4.0,"We choose to visit Deoksugung because of its size. We would like to be able to tour the ground and thought that Gyeongbok and Changdeok is too much for our group of elderly and small children to walk through and cover all.We arrive exactly as the changing of the guard ceremony is about to start at 11 am and lucky enough to find a booth in front of the main gate that offer services of young korean student for a free tour to tourist. They were official and looked very professional with their orange uniform and obviously they get the support from the local govt. The purpose is to practise their english with foreigners and to learn more of their own culture, which I thought were very nice.Sara, our guide was only 14 years old, about the same age as my eldest daughter, thus they were instantly having a girl talk :) she showed us around the palace complex, stopped every now and then to explain about the buildings and their history.The complex also has a museum, but we choose not to go in so cant comment on that one."
38,3.0,"The guard changing was interesting, tradition passed down though generations, guards in traditional clothings, martial art demostration.  There's a carpenter outside the wall. Need to buy tickets to enter premise. More of preserved architectures, for photography. Not for wet weather."
39,4.0,"located near the city hall, good to walk around and see korean palace. Convenient access but nothing much to do there."
40,5.0,"One of the ""Five Grand Palaces of Joseon Dynasty”, is easy to access as it is located in the city centre in front of Seoul Plaza and City Hall.I really recommend to check out official information about time of changing guard ceremonies (we saw one at 14:00 and it was the biggest performance - took around ~30 mina - with also music show and martial art show). They are WORTH watching. Tourists are also encouraged to take photos with the guards :)For palace itself it is a big complex with both Western and Asian architecture. Additional Western-style buildings were added during Korean modernization period in XIX/XX century.Highly recommend to visit this palace!"
41,5.0,"I never dreamed there were so many beautiful palaces in Korea!  This palace seemed smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but equally as impressive!"
42,3.0,Not really that impressive. Can cover the palace ground in less than an hour.However the changing of the guard is quite interesting. It can be viewed at the entrance of the palace and hence not necessary to pay the 1000 won fee. It's done 3 time a day.
43,4.0,"this is the place that u see what a gorgeous colourful tree. what colour u wanna see u will see, u will enjoy with step u walk through."
44,4.0,Went there around 4pm and just managed to catch the royal guard changing ceremony. Entered the park too to snap good photos of autumn. The view is stunning.
45,4.0,"We did not pay the entrance fee to enter the palace.  We came to witness the guard-changing ceremony which take place three times a day  (11:00 / 14:00 / 15:30) in front of Daehanmun Gate.  It is easy to get here by subway, either Exit 1 or 3 of City Hall station.  We came earlier and took a stroll along the stone way path beside the external wall of the palace, which is very picturesque especially in autumn.  The guard changing ceremony is quite interesting and they even allow us time to take pictures with the guards after the ceremony."
46,5.0,"This is the palace I visited other than Changdeokgung. It was not as big as Changdeokgung or Gyeongbokgung. But inside there is a combination of old palace and modern-looking palace (plus a modern contemporary art museum).At the beginning, you can watch changing of guards. And that day (Friday, October 9th 2015) at around 12-1 pm, there is a traditional (+modern fusion) music show. MUST WATCH! I'm not sure if it's held everyday/not."
47,4.0,"This is included if you get the combination Palace pass. It is near City Hall. It is very much like the other Palaces, but very nice. On reflection I would not get the combination pass as in my opinion you do not need to see them all, as they are much the same."
48,3.0,"My parents and I visited this medium sized palace on a sunny day and we saw the changing of the guards parade which was quite interesting although it gets draggy after a while.  You can take photos with the guards at the entrance and if you have children the guard will pose for you as well (unlike the stiff royal guards at the Tower of London). This place is for you if you enjoy photography of architecture and outdoors. There is a cafe and resting areas within the compound but there are lots more eateries including Dunkin Donuts just outside the entrance (you can find a seat there facing the entrance, and when the changing of guards ceremony starts you can enjoy the whole ritual while you munch your donuts but chances are the tourists will block your view).  There is a contemporary art museum located within the compound and also another historical building inside but I found the former a little boring, and the latter only allows guided tours at specific hours which you need to book in advance because of restrictions in group size."
49,4.0,"As my aged parents couldn't walk alot, so we chose this palace to visit. We went there to watch the guard-changing ceremony. It was interesting & we enjoyed the short martial art performance too. After that, we went in & take a slow stroll around. It was quiet & not so many tourists. We sat down to eat ice-cream & drink coffee at a outdoor snack kiosk. It was very relaxing."
50,5.0,"My aunt and I came upon this little place by accident, we were actually trying to catch the metro for another palace.The interesting thing about this palace is that its remains lie across the street from Seoul City Hall where there is always a concert or market or something going on.When you walk in, the palace itself is just beyond the trees and paths of greenery.The designs of the palace itself are those that one sees in all the palaces, flowers with bright colors and repetition of all the designs.As you walk further into the area, you come across a museum of art which is separated from the palace by a little pond with a fountain. The hustle and bustle of the street and city beyond the palace walls all but disappears.It's crazy to have the two contrasts of old meets new in this small area."
51,5.0,"I brought my 9 yr old who doesn't know anything about Korean history. It was a great opportunity for me to share about Korean culture and history. Naturally, he asked good number of questions, otherwise would never come up in other context. Glad to bring my son here to show his Korean heritage and simply learn more about Korea. It wasn't crowded and took us about an hour to have a quick visit."
52,5.0,The changing of guards is the main attraction of this palace. Be sure to be on time to watch it and get a nice view. And you can have a picture with the guards after the event!
53,4.0,"Last month my mother and me visited the Deoksugung Palace.. It is a must visit as it provides us the opportunity to view how exactly were the Korean traditions, it's architectural and artistic excellence and definitely the warmth that it possess for tourists even today.. It has an art museum as well which is worth appreciating.. The most beautiful is the parade or the ceremony which showcases the true culture of Korea.. You will also find a coffee shop to refresh and rejuvenate.. I loved the clock that told the time using the sun in earlier times... You will also come to know about the king who lived in Deoksugung... Overall it's a great place to visit...!!!"
54,5.0,"We went in November and it was raining and cold.  We were fortunate to arrive just in time for the changing of the guards.  The experience was terrific and we took advantage of the photo op.  We happened to take a tour earlier and had learned a lot about the significance of the architecture which made this tour more interesting for us.  There's not actually so much to see, the buildings are sparsely decorated and you cannot go inside them, but it is worth seeing nonetheless (if for no other reason than to see the changing of the guard)."
55,5.0,"This palace is one of the smallest but might be the best to go to. It is right beside the City Hall. It has a very elaborate changing of the guards ceremony at 11:00, 2:00, and 3:30pm. It has a pond that turns into a skating rink during winter. The National Museum of Art is inside. The western style palace of the last emperor has an English audio tour that describes in detail the history and circumstances of the last Korean royal family. All of these for just 1,000 won per person!"
56,4.0,"It is a welcome  experience to see the changing colors of autumn in parks and palaces and in areas surrounded by flowers and trees. One beautiful place to visit  is Deoksugung palace. A very nice attraction in the middle of the city. We wanted to see the trees and the leaves and walk around the whole place and feel the cold wind and the cozy ambience. We weren't disappoined. We got what we came for. We even played with the fallen leaves on the ground and took lots and lots of photos.It's even more exciting because we got to wear a hanbok for free even for just a very limited time. There was the usual changing of the guards ceremony which we didn't watch anymore because we saw them in another palace before. Outside, there are restaurants where you could eat and rest after hours of walking around the palace."
57,4.0,"Among all the palace this closed at 9pm the rest like Gyeonbokkyung,Changdeokgung,Changgyeonggung Palace all closed at 4.30pm a tourism hot spot yet closed at 4.30pm unbelievable."
58,5.0,Get off at metro called Town Hall and not very far is this Deoksugung Small entry fee and it like  a big park and lot of old building to explore around. Got cafe and WC on site. Most building you cannot go in but they have left door open so you can see through.The paintwork of assorted colour is beautiful and architecture design are amazing. The roof have mini Gargoyles. It was a perfect hot day and just lovely to walk around. We were Lucky there were Cultural festival that day and all soldier wearing uniform and changing of the guard. Big giant drum of gong were played and Korean Band in bright yellow and blue uniform played music. As well as important men in their costumes. Masses of people stood and watch and allowing to have photo taken with them. It was a Great day for a little cost. Took us over two hours
59,5.0,"Easy to find this not so big palace. Just right in the city centre. Subway station next to the gate. You can also watch the changing guard ceremony ( a few times a day). The palace are very calm, peaceful and clean. There also some snack and coffee shops in front and back corner of the yard where we can sit and relax enjoying the palace surrounding scenery. Beautiful"
60,4.0,Very quick site to see. They have some sort of changing of the guard ceremony daily. Costs 1000 won (about $1 USD) to get in. Mix of korean and strange Western buildings. There's also a small museum in the back that's included in the entrance fee.
61,4.0,"The palace is lovely - not as ostentasious as Changdoekgung, but less busy and more accessible. Try and download the virtual palace app before you get there - its really helpful in explaining the significance of the sites. The Mueseum of Art, situated in the palace grounds, is small but very well curated. During my visit there was a retrospective of Korean art from the 1940's Take a moment on the steps of the gallery to look out over the top of the palace and the city scape behind it, the effect of co-existence of old and new is awesome. The changing of the guard happens around 14:00 daily - and really is a site to behold. Get yourself out of the main gate a few minutes before the start for a good view. I found that standing to the sides of the entrance gate provided me with some shade and a really good view. There is an opportunity to take pictures with the guard directly after the changing - it makes for some really awesome shots, as they stay in character."
62,4.0,"Small in size compared to the big and famous gyeongbokgung palace. Situated right next to the city hall metro station. Very convenient to reach. Had the modern art exhibition when I visited. But the guard changing ceremony is not to be missed. In fact can be better appreciated here, as crowd is less. If you reach early, can take photographs with the royal guards. Very friendly. But the palace complex itself is small in size and some parts are under renovation, hence closed. But can spend few hours here."
63,4.0,"Nice palace with a variety of architecture to include Korean, mixed (Korean architecture designed by Russian architecture, western style buildings).  They had some interactive games and the kids enjoyed playing the one that they played.   We watched the changing of the guard which is scheduled at various times and occurs at the front gate.  This palace had a nice thrown room that you could go in which was unique.  If you only have a chance to visit one palace then I would go to one of the others as there are multiple palaces in Seoul such as Gyeongbokgung, but if you have time or are going to be in Seoul for awhile then this is a nice visit.  It only took a few hours.  Fee is reasonable as we have found most of them to be in Seoul."
64,4.0,"It was a unique experience visiting the palace surrounded by the busy city life and traffic. Within the walls you witness the old palace in its time. The trees were beautiful, lining the walk towards the grand palace.While the palace was smaller compared to the Chinese palaces, it doesn't loose its grandeur. Best visit in Autumn to witness the foliage of the ginkgo and maple trees.The change of guard is elaborate and not to be missed. Check the schedules.Don't miss this."
65,4.0,As we stayed at the Westin during our Seoul holiday we could walk to the palace within 10 minutes.For a few Wong you can see some interesting Korean architecture and even more important you can relax. It was snowing during that day and this made the atmosphere just perfect. The palace itself is not that big but it gives you a good idea about the life a century ago. Love it.
66,5.0,"What a pleasant surprise, tucked next to City Hall:  an elaborate and accessible Changing Of The Guards ceremony,  apparently running all the time; very inexpensive ticket price; immaculately restored and kept grounds and buildings, all in a compact space.  Perfect for the tourist with limited time, this gives a reasonable idea of the architecture and style of the glory days of Korea, just as the Japanese were taking over.  There is a constant delicious juxtaposition of the spacious grounds surrounded by the totems of modern life, shopping malls and skyscrapers.   Unlike the much bigger Gyeongbokgung (palace) where one may feel at times transported to the 17th century, at the DeoksuGung you always see the context -- the value Korea places on its history and its future both.A further plus is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, tucked in the back of the grounds like a forgotten relative.  Quite tame and not really very modern, the museum is now showing Masterpieces of Modern Korean Painting: an interesting set of tableaux, clearly designed for a Korean-language audience.  Still, it's worth a visit."
67,5.0,"This was the first of 2 palaces we visited.  We enjoyed this one better than Gyeongbokgung.  Price was vey low, the grounds were beautiful, and as an extra treat we happened to be there for the changing of the guard.  Very easy to access from the Metro (line 1 City Hall stop).  Lots of older buildings to see with English signs.  Everyone enjoyed this palace."
68,4.0,"Not the biggest palace but right in town and can done quickly if you don't have too much time, try to assist to the guards shift change, quite entertaining and explained in English"
69,5.0,Nice palace to get a rest in the evening. Specially nice during week-end to combine with looking on activities in the place in front of the city hall.
70,5.0,"Ys, the changing of guards is highlight n pls note it is every hrs during show time, ie 1100, 1200 ....But most don't know there is a souvenir shop serving drink, the view is good and souvenirs are inexpensive but pretty.  That s why I think you should not miss,After visiting this in the morning, you could simply walk to nearby attractions easily.  You may consider to go there by taxi and arrive exactly in the gate without Any walking and good timing."
71,3.0,"As we were going to City Hall, we passed Deoksugung Palace and decided to enter it since we were already there. I think we only got charged 1,000 won although other's say the charge was 10,000 won. I remember thinking how cheap the entrance fee for this palace was and that was the reason we decided to check it out.If you're going around Seoul in a taxi, you will notice that there are many palaces nearby. In my country, there's only one palace! There was a gate called Daehanmun gate and supposedly a changing of the guard but we didn't see one. We went to the throne room of the palace where dignitaries were received. You see the seat where the king would sit down. If you saw one of those period Korean drama of the Joseon dynasty, this is how it looks like. It wasn't really huge. We also saw Seokjojeon from afar and it has fountains. Unfortunately for us, it rained very hard while we were at the throne room and so we didn't really get to visit the rest of the palace. The courtyard very quickly flooded and I don't know how people knelt here during the Joseon dynasty period to give respect to the king. The pavement wasn't even smooth and it would hurt anyone's knees who knelt there for a period of time.As soon as the rain subsided, we decided to leave the palace grounds so we can proceed to where we were really going."

73,5.0,The changing of the guard can be viewed three times a day at Deoksugung.   You can all borrow (for free) traditional clothing and take your picture with one of the palace guards.   The palace grounds also house a museum of contemporary art.  The palance is directly across the street from the renovated City Hall.
