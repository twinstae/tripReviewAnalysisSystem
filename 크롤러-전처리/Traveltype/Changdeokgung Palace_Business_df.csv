0,5.0,"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun.The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours."
1,5.0,Just visit if you do have at least 3 hs to go to every place in this complex of buildings and gardens. You can visit all of it for wons 9.000. Even a secret garden excursion. This place and gardens are breathtaking. Although the buildings lack more historical information in booklets or audio guided visits it is stills worth it.
2,4.0,Is good place to have an look of their historical past which i wonder why the area is quite small in compare with palaces in other countries.Good photo taking with modern building surrounding the palace
3,5.0,if you can rent a traditional outfit from the stores near by and wonder around like a local. It will help you appreciate the atmospher being recreated.
4,5.0,It is a temple where you mind find some Korean culture inspirations if you have time worth having a look
5,4.0,"The architecture is mesmerizing. Even can relate to China and Japan's architectures, still it has its own identity"
6,5.0,this was one of the best places that I ever saw. you can also rent a Korean custom and tour the palace along with the old heritage.
7,5.0,"A place that you must visit in Seoul.If you like history, this site will satisfy you.There are so many buildings & courtyards to view that you will be lost in your own world.The highlight of this historical site however is the Secret Garden appended to the Palace grounds. In fact the area taken up by the Secret Garden is larger that the actual Palace grounds.There is Nature, History and beauty to behold. The tour takes you on a wonderful walk through the grounds. In autumn, with the red, yellow and orange leaves, it is a unforgettable sight.Plan for a visit in either Spring or Autumn."
8,5.0,The place is in downtown and we could see the time when they were exchange the guards. The ceremony is very interesting. The place is very nice.
9,5.0,Loved the secret garden! Calm and quiet place. The tour guide was thoughtful and professional. The history behind the garden was interesting.
10,3.0,"Nice architecture, but too traditional bulding, nothing very interesting. Quite big area, and important to Koreans"
11,5.0,"We spent a very enjoyable morning at the palace and the hidden gardent on two guided tours. The gardens were especially nice and the guide who led the tour was exceptionally good. Be prepared to walk (about 2-3 mi) on hilly terrain if you tour the garden.  The only downside of the tour was the relentless rain, which was quite heavy at times. If you visit the site at the beginning of the rainy season, bring rain gear."
12,3.0,"Spent upwards of an hour here with local guide. Should have cut it to 30 mins and made additional stops. Interesting, but not compelling stop."
13,3.0,"Went on a guided tour here and I felt it helps to better understand and enjoy the sights in Changdeokgung. It was less crowded than Gyeongbokgung when I was there. Nice to put on hanbok and take colourful photos! (By the way, admission was free since we wore hanbok!)"
14,5.0,"Beautiful, very interesting and so well preserved!I spent several hours here, despite the severe June heat and humidity and was absolutely fascinated by the history of the palace - highly recomended"
15,5.0,This place is renovated it was built long time ago but had some kind of destruction after couple of wars and they rebuilt it againYou need to have someone with you to explain what is in there otherwise you wouldn't understand what is the area all about
16,5.0,Korean palaces are quite different and very simple in decorations. The architecture and the design is very scientific.
17,5.0,"Seoul is famous for its 4 palaces. This is one of those palaces. This palace had been used as a main palace since the Third King in Chosun Dynasty, Tae-Jong departed the main palace, KyungBokgung because he hated to remember killing his own brothers during political changes and to stay there."
18,5.0,"When you're in seoul you have to visit Changdeokgung, a wonderful palace area with parks and a lot of interesting buildings. You will also see several Korean people in traditional dresses, which is very interesting and beautiful."
19,4.0,"Had a great time exploring the palace and temples surrounding it. Combo ticket allowed entry to everything, and was good for 3 months for about $10. It was a really nice way to spend my first full day in Korea."
20,5.0,"Although smaller than Gyeongbokgung it seemed more authentic (large portions of Gyeongbokgung were destroyed and they are in the process of renovating).  Felt that here you could really see how they lived. Glad I went to both, but if I could only go back to one, it would be this one."
21,4.0,"Not so good for a very cold day as almost everthing is outside. If you have been to the forbidden city in China, this will be a dissappointment."
22,5.0,"Part of the combination ticket, this palace is also nice to visit and imagine life at its richness during the Joseon period."
23,5.0,"This is the smaller of the two principal palaces in Seoul, and unlike its larger twin, this one was restored after being attacked and damaged by the Japanese centuries ago.  The temples and courtyards are divided into three distinct areas, all of which had to be traversed before an audience with the King could be granted.  The Queen's chambers were separate from the King's, but when trying for children, there was a separate area without any furnishings, for fear of an assassination attempt!"
24,4.0,"One of the '5 Grand Palaces', this should be part of your program to witness the changing of the guard ceremony, and the gardens behind the walls."
25,4.0,Had a nice day in the palace and it´s well worth it going to the secret garden. Book ahead though as only a limited number of people can go on a tour. Wasn´t difficult to reserve online one day before but check again to be sure.
26,4.0,"We spent a morning here in March. The Palace is lovely, with lots to see and discuss. The building(s) is so vast, expect lots of walking. There were a lot of tourists there so expect to stay a while to get good pictures."
27,3.0,It is a very large area. Apart from the buildings there is not that much to see. The grounds are very serene and well kept.
28,5.0,Place is big and interesting. You can rent costumes if you want to take pictures using Korean Historic Clothes (10-20 US Dollars)
29,4.0,"This was the only palace I had time to tour while in Seoul, but I was grateful for the opportunity.  There is so much symbolism to the architecture and furnishings that I would have been oblivious to without a guide.  Also, learning how the multiple palaces in Seoul relate to each other was a fascinating lesson.  This was an impressive visit!"
30,4.0,"First this is a UNESCO Heritage site. So one good reason to go. It seats near Angku Station so getting there is not an issue. Take Line 3 to Angku, exit 3 and walk for 500 meters. This is a huge site so do plan time to visit. This sites have two areas and separate entry fee. 3000 won gets you to the palace. Which I feel is good enough. It took me a good 1.5 hours. Overall good to spend some time on."
31,4.0,This turned out to be a nice green spot near City Hall. It cost about $1 to visit and it took us about 30 minutes to walk around the park.
32,4.0,Very informative and interesting to walk through. Get some idea of history of the country. Architecture is stunning.Takes about 1 to 1 1/2 hours .
33,5.0,Enjoy the serenity in the city; the secret garden is a must visit. Visit the website to check out current events. Palace visit does not always have to be educational.
34,4.0,The palace provides an opportunity to reflect on some of the older history of Korea. It has been well restored and it is a pleasant place to visit on a nice day.
35,5.0,"Make sure to get a tour of the gardens. The palace is lovely and the architecture is impressive, but nothing you won't see at the other palaces. The garden is really the main point of coming here."
36,3.0,"Must go before 10:00am for morning session for during that time, its change of guides and that's when the shows in on.See how their Kings Life styles.Tour Guide will tell you the history"
37,5.0,So great to see Korea's cultural past on display. It is great to walk the grounds and imagine what it would have been like during those times.
38,5.0,"We visited the Changdeokgung Palace as a part of the day trip in Seoul. It is a compex of beautifusl, historical palaces that unfold a rich Korean history. No wonder it is a UNESCO preserved heritag sight. This is a must-see while visiting Seoul."
39,5.0,so interesting and full of history.  Cannot believe you are standing at a Palace built so long ago with such ancient traditions.
40,4.0,"This is one of the smaller palace in Seoul. The main attraction is Huwon (better known as Secret Garden, but more appropriately known as a the Rear/Back Garden). It is difficult to plan efficiently for this trip as the English guided tour would clash with the Huwon tour. I had the Huwon tour followed by a self guided walk through the remaining palace compound. You should be a able to cover this within half a day.After the trip, it would be nice to take a stroll at the nearby Bukchon to see traditional Korean houses. Stop by one of the hill top teahouses to warm up and charge your phones while enjoying tea and the evening city views. Be prepared to put on good walking shoes and to spare the remaining half of the day at this area."
41,4.0,"Highly recommended for a visit.  This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning, particularly in Autumn - it's a photograper's dream, particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress ( a lovely, popular current trend).  Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there."
42,4.0,"I found that the other palaces are just as interesting if not more--but the Secret Garden (which is an extra admission) is the highlight of this place.  If you go--you must take a walk around the garden.   If time is short, I think Gyeongbokgung Palace is more interesting."
43,3.0,"You must visit at least one Palace in Korea, once you have done one, well they are pretty much the same and well worth the visit."
44,4.0,"Try to get there when they have the changing of the guard ceremony, very colourful, the palace is a very interesting building but try and find a guide that can explain the history."
45,4.0,We liked visiting this palace and specially to see the heating system to keep the rooms warm during winter.
46,5.0,This palace and all the the gardens and surroundings are really worth the visit.You should take you time to enjoy the vastness of the place.Very impressive. You can very easily imagine the life they were living in here.There is mo way you can miss this visit.
47,4.0,This is the another heritage palace next to Gyeongbokgung palace in the same toad. Both palaces are easily accessible when you get in through Anguk metro station
48,5.0,Elegant and understated. The architecture is similar to Gyeongbokgung palace with some slight differences.
49,5.0,"Was fortunate enough to visit during the evening, as a foreigner could buy a ticket (only 500 reserved for foreigners). Great event with many Korean people in traditional dress (understood that provides them free entrance). Very enchanting"
50,3.0,"If you want to see the guard changing ceremony, go early in the morning (around 8:30 AM). The place is huge.. so plan accordingly.."
51,5.0,"be sure to do the secret garden -- there are regular tours in English. All signs are in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese."
52,5.0,I think that I would have enjoyed this more with a tour guide instead of relying on what I could find on the internet. I was surprised that although centrally located the palace and grounds are vast- be prepared to walk- this is not a place to pop in and visit in 10 minutes
53,5.0,"The palace is nice, but the gardens are outstanding. If you have a chance to tour both, allow for extra time. The opening hours for palace and garden are different."
54,4.0,I really like the architecture of these ancient palaces. Another thing that might be nice to see is the change of the guards. Always a nice show of itself.
55,5.0,Great experience..with historic background...the near muesum is really helpful to know about the korean history
56,4.0,"the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings, There's not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable"
57,5.0,It's quite a bit larger than the palace we visited earlier but there aren't as many people here. The peace and quiet is wonderful and we are looking forward to touring the Secret Garden.
58,4.0,Because of time limit I could only visit this Palace. I couldn't afford more free time. I could enjoy at least a short aspect of this culture. The secrte garden will remain secret only guided visit is allowed. Again not enough time!
59,5.0,"This is where the kings and queens of Korea lived, and around 30% is in original condition.  Book a guide and get the story of the travails of the royal family over the centuries."
60,5.0,The philosophy of Confusius comes alive when you visit this beautiful Palace complex.  We took a taxi from our hotel and took the English language tour (taxis are a bargain in Seoul).  A Japanese colleague with us noticed that the Japanese language guide made no mention of the Japanese having once burnt this Palace.
61,3.0,"The main palace is beautiful but you definitely have to visit the Secret gardens. We visited in summer, but I guess the garden will be beautiful in Autumn and Spring. There are only two English tours to the secret Garden in a day and that's a problem. You cannot visit the Secret Garden just by yourself."
62,3.0,"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention  that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing."
63,4.0,Took the tour of the palace and then booked the secret garden tour as well which was really special and some interesting ponds and gardens to see along the way.  Well worth the trip.
64,4.0,"a collection of several palaces with traditional Korean design.there are a wide area of different buildings from king palaces, queen palaces, offices, kitchen and so on.they were made of wood and cover by beautiful colors.its like a dream! you lost in history.behind the palace you see a green park and lake.also you find some museum here too."
65,5.0,I was very pleasantly surprised to visit this beautiful palace and to not have to share it with throngs of other people as I would have had to in the main palace a short distance away.
66,4.0,"I visited the palace as part of my conference tour group. The Ministry of Tourism had made a special arrangement for my group to see the palace at night. It was a wonderful moonlight tour and even some of the Koreans in my group were so pleased because they had never visited this place at night. We were even treated to special cultural shows, which gave me a good appreciation for the rich and diverse Korean culture."
67,5.0,It's the place to visit in Korea. We have many nice walk around to explain the history of Korea. Discovery of new methodology...
68,5.0,This place compares internationally and has a majestic character uniquely its own. I have seen some of the most prominent European palaces and this one is up there with the best. It would be fair to say that every single wooden element is a piece of art in its own right. As far as I was able to tell the entire building is made of wood with no (visible) metallic elements. The wood is meticulously hand painted with stunningly articulate floral patterns. The walls and ceilings are decorated with traditional symbolic paintings. This is a must see and highly recommended.
69,4.0,"The Palace is interesting to visit, and easy to get to.  I was on a business trip so very little time for sight-seeing so the Palace was a place that I could take some time out to see."
70,5.0,"If you have seen Gyeongbokgung Palace, you don't necessarily have to see Changdeokgung Palace but you go there drive-by style on your way to the Secret Garden, which is highly recommendable. Mind you access to the garden is by guided tour only so make sure to check out the opening hours."
71,5.0,"I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces--and I visited them all! I took two free English-language tours. The first one--a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour--of the Secret Garden--was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant--but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring, and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was ""WOW!"""
72,5.0,"Guided tour is very informative. Since the secret garden is very large, you want to follow a guide. It is recommended to book the tour ahead as this is very popular. If you start the tour at 3:30 (the last tour), you won't have enough time to see the buildings. So plan to see the buildings first before you to go to the secret garden. After walking around the garden you will be too tired too!"
73,5.0,"This place is one of an old palaces in Seoul, Korea. I recommend you to visit this palace in day time to see beautiful architecture."
74,5.0,"Worth a visit, especially when guards change. We just walked through, but you can stay there for longer and get some insights about the palace and history"
75,4.0,"Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see."
76,5.0,"A must visit venue, English speaking guides - need to book in advance. Guided tour lasts  about 1.5 hours, but you can spend lost more time there enjoying the history and the heritage."
77,5.0,This was great.  I am positive it would be prettier in the summer months with flowers etc. The young wear proper uniforms and dress to visit.  The guards do something every day i think at  3pm
78,4.0,A small brother of the forbidden city in Bejing. The buildings are well preserved and it's a pleasure to wander around this complex of palaces. You will meet a lot of locals in authentic clothing!
79,5.0,"Worth going on a guided tour. Very interesting and beautiful gardens. Takes around an hour to get around and I'd recommend comfy shoes, not the suit and work shoes I was wearing!"
80,5.0,So beautiful to see the royal buildings and get to know how it used to be before Japanese invasion for 35yrs which cleansed a lot of their history.I saw the guard change still done the way used to be. A must ... It's a travel in time
81,5.0,This not too well know palace is a germ! Do not forget to visit the lovely gardens in the back! Even better then the Secret Gardens around the corner!
82,5.0,This is a must-see in Seoul and small enough to squeeze in for an afternoon. We went during a short afternoon sojourn. They close at promptly 5 pm so be sure to be there at least 4pm.
83,4.0,"Interesting to see the history of korea and getting to know more of the historical buildings. We were ""running trough"" the area, that is quite big."
84,5.0,Well I am in love with the people of Korea and their behave with the tourists. Actually the guide showed me the old historic ways ..
85,5.0,"This was the most impressive of the palaces I visited.Located inside a beautiful part - which I highly recommend for a hike or a 40-60 minute walk, it is well maintained, has information in English, and gives an overall feeling for Korean Heritage.Definitely the one Palace I would not miss."
86,4.0,The Palace is historical and quietly beautiful. The Secret Garden can only be accessed through the guided tours. 1 1/2 hours to cover the grounds. If you don't mind traveling sometimes in a very large group (English tour on a beautiful fall day numbered over 100 people) you'll have a pleasant time.
87,5.0,"Amazing site, beautiful shrines, and breathtaking colours. This is a paid attraction but it's free for South Koreans who dress in traditional clothes. The gardens are a dream"
88,5.0,Book your visit to the Secret Garden online well in advance of your trip - limited places in the guided tours in English (as backup solution you could join a Korean guided tour as well - marvelous views don't need explanations).
89,4.0,I visited this palace which was a five minutes walk from my hotel and I loved that it was well preserved and showed the history of Korea. Couldn't get into the museum because it was closed. It was also helpful that most signs were written in both English and Korean
90,3.0,"I was very short on time, but was able to sqeeze in a visit to Changdeokgung Palace in about an hour.  The Palace has is beautifully restored, and provides a good insight into what historical Seoul would have been like.  It would be great to actually be able to get inside some of the buildings or to have some set up with period furniture to even further fill in the context.  Regardless, it's a lovely place to walk around."
91,5.0,"Changdeokgung — also known as Changdeokgung Palace or Changdeok Palace — is set within a large park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces"" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty"
92,5.0,It's like stepping back in time. Make sure you catch the changing of the guard at the front gate to the palace.
93,5.0,This is a must see if you are in Seoul. The grounds and buildings are beautiful. It is a very peaceful place to walk and enjoy the scenery
94,4.0,"One of South Korea's most popular tourist attractions. At the entrance there is a Changing of the Guard, somewhat of a Korean variant on Buckingham Palace, with traditional costumes and music. I believe this place can be crowded at times, but Friday noon it was ok. The park is large with another large garden, the further you will walk into the park, the more quiet it becomes. And that is the moment where you really get to enjoy it. Peaceful relaxation and stunning views into the mountains. I am normally not much of an historician but would like to come back here one day just early in the morning or late in the evening."
95,4.0,"Architecturally interesting to see, but not much of the interiors are available to see.  It's definitely worth seeing however."
96,5.0,This was smaller than Gyeongbukgong but still beautiful and maintained its majestic facade. One bonus was the little craft and coffee shop inside; however the souvenirs were so expensive!
97,5.0,"Exciting place. Glorious in its simplicity. Huge gardens, buildings in very good condition.A must while in Seoul."
98,5.0,A must visit when in SeoulAllow plenty time to visit this huge immaculate palace & grounds. Great value
99,4.0,"A nice palace with the usual decorated roofs, and pleasing complexes of interconnected buildings. The secret garden was fine, but not especially beautiful, and a long organised walk in a large group is not the best way to enjoy it. Maybe at just the right cherry moment it would be worth it (I was a week and a storm  or two too late), but otherwise don't worry too much if you miss it."
100,5.0,I only have limited time and always ask for the top attraction and this certainly met the mark. I took the underground there which made it easy to get to. This is a tourist place and after reading about this it is actually a rebuilt but you do not notice this. It truly is beautiful and worth a visit for a few hours to wonder.
101,4.0,"It's definitely worthy a visit, not too crowded, very peaceful, right in the heart of the city. Didn't have time to visit the secret gardens, went too late."
102,5.0,"A beautiful palace, but I loved the guided tour of the 'Secret Garden', which was in English. Be warned, it is a 3 KM walk. It takes you through lovely woodland, stopping off in various oasis' to explore pavilions, lilly ponds and summer residences. It was exceptionally hot, so quite a challenge, but so interesting."
103,4.0,"We were going to go to a different palace but it was closed on the day, so we went here. Basically you should visit one of the palaces whilst in Seoul. They do rotate when they will be closed so there will always be one of the palaces open for viewing. Admission was free. There are poster boards that give you a bit of history in English so tour guide not necessary. When we went there were only 10 people there so it was most peaceful to lose yourself back in time and imagining the palace how it used to be. Right at the back is a gigantic rock which we climb to the top and were rewarded with a wonderful view and great photo opportunity."
104,5.0,"It is huge and a lot of walking is involved.The changing of the guard' is worth viewing, if not only for the gear they wear.I enjoyed myself here"
105,4.0,"Very interesting complex / palace not far away from the city centre. Must see on a sightseeing map in Seoul. Very nice place for a walk and sightseeing, especially with the guide. I was on a 1 day trip in Seoul, Ms. Guide was very nice and funny, she spoke very good English, so there was no problem to understand everything she said. Probably single trip would be more interesting, than in a group of random ppl, but I didn't have time for organizing everything by myslef. The company did pick-up from the hotel, so I didnt have to worry about anything. Unfortunately I dont remember how was the trip called and via what company. I've ordered it from the hotel. Beautiful place worth to spend time there!"
106,5.0,A smaller version of the Forbidden City/Imperial Palace in Beijing and I found this more inviting. The tour guide was amazing in telling the stories of those who lived there and what life was like. You can spend the entire day there or just a few minutes to get the feeling of being transported back in time.
107,5.0,"I liked the fact that the temples are blended perfectly with the surrounding forest and the amazing colors of buildings. Also I liked the tour of the gardens (only in a group), so make sure you don't skip it. Try to let the group walk ahead and enjoy the silence and will let you to take amazing photos."
108,5.0,Worth to visit and plunge into history. If you are interested in the insights of the place my advise is to take a guide.
109,5.0,"While it was a very cold day, the sun was shining and it was a wonderful walk around the secret gardens and then the palace later. Well worth the trip."
110,1.0,"if you have never been to Asia and this is the only sight seeing you will do, then this is a nice palace to start but if you have been to other major cities in Asia, this is not impressive. It would not even make the top 100 in Kyoto."
111,4.0,Very nice tour with a guided tour section of the Secret garden. Can visit the whole palace within couple of Hours and within walking distance from he main  gyeongbokgung Palace. A must see if you are visiting Soul.
112,4.0,"A well preserved palace in the heart of Seoul. Guided tours are available. Architecturally, the palace takes a lot of it's design from the Chinese."
113,5.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before going to this palace, and boy, what a difference. Changdeokgung is beautiful, has much more English information, and the Secret Garden is amazing. I was especially amazed by the ancient trees and the different styles of the buildings. Too bad there was no audio guide!"
114,5.0,"I visited the Palace for the second time in a year and I liked the atmosphere of imperial Korea and the surrounding gardens (fully developed in August, blossoming in April). Make sure you have at least 2-3 hours to spend there!"
115,5.0,"I wandered around this beautiful complex with free admission, because I had turned up on the last Wednesday of the month (great tip if you are in the city at this time!).  It is easy to spend a couple of hours here, exploring the buildings and grounds.  You can also take a tour of the Secret Garden - this has to be a tour and there are limited tickets, so be sure to get there early for a tour in your language.  Well worth the extra fee though - so tranquil."
116,4.0,It was a very informative tour given by the local guide. We also saw a great performance by the palace guards. Overall it was a great way to spend a few hours learning about there culture.
117,4.0,I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time.  There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.
118,4.0,"The ancient architecture is beautiful even in the depths of winter's chill.  So, take a quick tour or enter the palace."
119,4.0,"What a fantastic piece of history, restored well.  Well worth a visit and if timed right look out for the ""Changing of the Guard"". Really brings history alive and can picture the king and courtiers there too. Also for the adventurous try the stewed silk worm larvae  outside the main gate. Knocks the ""Bush Tucker Trial"" into a cocked hat."
120,4.0,"Went here during winter, so its beautiful as the compound is all-white but still nice. But it might be too cold for some. The lady who gave us the tour is really polite and speak fluent english. A great place to walk and take pictures. always love it that South Korea's palaces are around in the city, among the modern high rise building."
121,4.0,"There were so many school kids there. We had limited time at this destination, I would have liked to spend a lot more time here. Interesting culture. We missed the live performance."
122,4.0,"You'll need very comfortable shoes to tour the entire complex. Advisable to schedule with a tour guide because of the significance of each area of the palace, especially the Secret Garden. The palace and its grounds are not just pretty to look at and for photography shoots but knowing its history makes the photos more meaningful. You'll understand why it is listed as a World Heritage."
123,4.0,"Sees the secret garden, only accessible as part of a guided tour. And this is, so they say, the main reason to come to the ""East palace"". If your Korean is yet to get to B1 you have to be there before 1:30 pm and there means at the entrance to the garden not the main one. Besides that the diversity of the buildings is remarkable, especially ingeneous is the floor heating system in the more modern elements."
124,4.0,"There is a beautiful garden to see with a guide.  Very historical and  enjoy walking in the garden.  Even you need to make a reservation to visit the garden, but it is worth to see."
125,4.0,Despite of many visitors it is a nice and calm oasis - nice to walk and enjoy tranquility and see beautiful Korean architecture
126,4.0,"Must visit. Although a bit jaded from my visit to the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace in Beijing during the same trip, it was still impressive and beautiful."
127,5.0,"There are lots of palaces in Seoul but this is probably the best.  It's a good idea to go early to try to minimize the crowds.  Unfortunately, like most of the palaces,  it is largely a recreation thanks to the Japanese occupation and the occasional fire.  The elements near and on the water are my favorites.   It's worth spending 3000 won for the audio tour guide.   If you can try to see on of the King's inspection shows."
128,5.0,"Palaces on Seoul were built in pairs, so this is one of the oldest Palaces that was built as the twin of Gyeonghuigung.  It is interesting to watch how the European architecture blend with the oriental one, in the leisure pavillion for example.  Also in October the European style part of the Palace will open as a museum."
129,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the spots I like and show off to foreign travelers as a Korean. Huwon, the rear garden, was designated as a World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. I am very proud of it and it is worth visiting here. You can feel the natural beauty itself fully."
130,5.0,"This great palace is situated in a beautiful garden, it is large and shows how power was executed centuries ago. Very well restyored after the Korean War"
131,5.0,Very nice place to go in Seoul. Impressing buildings and you will like this place. It´not to overcrowded even at the weekends.
132,4.0,"Not far from the Australian embassy, this palace is huge! Don't miss the changing of the guard ceremony - highly entertaining and different to any other guard changing you will ever see! I'd recommend a guided tour to appreciate the history of the palace and get a better understanding of its uses over time."
133,4.0,"This palace is a partial reconstruction.  Much of the original was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and by fire. It is enormous, and you get a sense of the wealth that must of have been concentrated in the hands of the rulers.  However, you view the buildings only from the outside, sometimes through open but roped off doors.  The original furnishings were carted off long ago. The best part of the property is the garden which requires a separate ticket.  There are an interesting range more and less formal pavilions, and some great landscaping."
134,5.0,whow -really impressive and perfectly restored- it is a most if you really want to enjoy all of it -take ample of time and idepending on  your taste a tour guide or at least a good guide book -so much to learn and to discover
135,5.0,This was a really lovely palace and it was early morning so cool for June. Beautiful gardens and worth the extra time to walk through them on the separate tour if you have the time.
136,4.0,"The history surrounding Changdeokgung is very interesting, so highly recommend a tour if you are going to do this one.  The Secret Garden tours are about 2 hours apart and are conducted in different languages, so some times you have to wait a bit to take the tour.  This was one of my favorite sites in Seould, I think visitors would find it highly interesting."
137,3.0,Traditional Asian style of palace. I had luxury to visit this with a local guy who told interesting stories. I would suggest to take one of the guided tours. You can spend hours here - but weather should be good as there's quite some walk outside.
138,5.0,"Each of the five main palaces in Seoul have been burned to the ground more than once over their lifespan. Some 600 years old, and with enough original (sic) buildings remaining, this palace is a great place to visit.When there, you must visit the 'Secret Garden', which is not at all secret, but a glimpse of ancient Seoul, now a bustling metropolis of up to 5 million people.If you have time, visit all of the palaces. They are all within walking distance of each other and there are some fantastic Hanoks you can stay in in the area between them (Bukchon Hanok Village)."
139,5.0,It is an absolutely must visit place for every traveler in Seoul. There are English tours available for the palace and secret garden. The tours cost about 3000 and 5000 KRW respectively. The secret garden is very attractive as it is spread over huuuge area and you get to be in the nature and historical place at the same time.
140,5.0,"Very nice experience and nice introduction to Korean culture and history. The guides provide very good information. The secret garden tour is good but the garden itself is not comparable with the gardens of royal palaces in Austria, France, UK, or Egypt but still very exciting. What could be distinguishing about the secret garden is that is really is ""very natural"" or in harmony with the environment."
141,5.0,"Tourists usually flock to the Royal Palace just down the road - and for good reason. Where that palace is grand and majestic, this complex is the verdant escape with more intimate hidden charms. A visit is incomplete without a walk around the Secret Gardens. There are small ponds and streams that snake through the property. Absolutely stunning and each season brings a different perspective. You will know you are in the right part of the grounds if you hit a second barrier requiring a second ticket to walk the grounds."
142,4.0,"Very similar to Gyeongbokgung, this palace has well kept and accessible buildings.  There is a lot to see in terms of architecture, art and interior design."
143,5.0,"Beautiful architecture retains painting only available to royalty- simply beautiful!  Tour guide Sue Chung from Cosmojin.com (suahc@cosmojin.com) is a fantastic (Korean and English speaking) asset to the city of Seoul- what a great ambassador!  She loves history and is eager to share her knowledge.  The azalea gardens will be spectacular in March or April!  We did not get to see the ""secret gardens"" and will have to return."
144,5.0,"This was our first palace in Seoul, and the nice thing was that it was not as busy  as Gyeongbokgung, great to stroll around and explore on your own. Again, beautiful buildings, very colorful."
145,5.0,Make reservations for the tour as early in advance as possible - they sell out quickly and we ended up doing a tour in japanese and didn't understand anything but wanted to see the secret garden
146,5.0,"It is amazing to walk around the palace knowing that it is older than the US.  The place seeps of history and untold stories of princes and princesses with all the regal functions of a palace court.  Oh the stories these walls could tell, only if they could speak."
147,5.0,When visiting Seoul this is one of the places you must see. A beautiful historical site. When possible visit this site during spring time.
148,4.0,"Great tour in english at 10am, perfect to learn more about it - don't miss the secret garden tour right after, great colors in autumn!"
149,5.0,This is another must see of Seoul. But wait for the regular guided tour. It all makes more sense if a guide shows you around. I took the English tour and the guide was simply great.
150,5.0,"If you want to learn something about Korean history, this is the right place. Well preserved palace complex with beautiful buildings. Definitely don't miss Secret Garden. I can recommend guided tour when you learn some interesting facts about life in this palace."
151,5.0,"Amazing palace. Make sure you catch a tour for the Huwon Secret Garden. It lasts 1,5 hour and it is an amazing environment."
152,3.0,"It was okay and if you have extra time to spend here then visit other wise I will advice you to visit only any one palace and then enjoy Seoul's local markets and pubs as they were much more enjoyable to me; however, you might find it different."
153,5.0,Of the palaces this one might require the most walking (if you visit the Secret Garden) but it is spectacular! I can't wait to go back in the fall to see the leaves and enjoy it without the heat. Our guide in the Secret Garden had the best English of any Palace guide I've heard in Korea. She did a great job!Note- If you go on the Secret Garden tour with a stroller or wheel chair you will be asked to return a different way from the rest of the crowd to avoid a long series of stairs. This is cool because that means that you are allowed to be alone in the Secret Garden section (under the steady surveillance of CCTV cameras ofcourse)!Remarkably stroller friendly and bathrooms were clean and easily accessible. Look into buying the book of tickets to multiple palaces. It's a great savings!
154,4.0,It is a unique attraction especially if you appreciate traditional architecture. It is a great place to visit and understand more about the history of Korea.
155,4.0,"I wanted to know more about the structures and the people who lived in them. The site is well preserved and wasn't very crowded.  If you like architecture and history, then this will interest you."
156,5.0,"The palace buildings were colorful; the gardens beautiful.  The tour of the Secret Gardens was nice but a bit long.  It is definitely worth it, but you can opt out halfway through."
157,4.0,A must visit !I felt the culture out there in this place.. I do recommend it to everyone visiting South Korea
158,4.0,"It has more history, its better maintained, but its also smaller than Geongbokgung palace, which I prefer.The tours are a better here and will give you more appreciation of the history.The hidden garden is worth the side trip too, if you like a good walk through the gardens (forest).Lots of places to visit within the area too."
159,4.0,This place looks like you are in some kind of fairytale.Different architecture. Many colors and patterns.
160,4.0,"Would recommend the palace visit if you want to get a quick flavour of Korean history.  Make sure you get a self guided booklet before you enter the grounds.  Without it, you will not appreciate the significance of the palace.  I know I have been there twice, the first time without the guide book."
161,5.0,Kind of forbidden city in smallest scale. Very well conserved. Worth visiting the garden area for a fee.
162,5.0,The Secret Garden is the best kept attraction in this place. Can be seen only as a guided tour. Take any language tour if time is a constraint as all places have detailed English signs and detailed descriptions of the locations and the significance.
163,5.0,"Most of my time here was spent on the tour of the Secret Garden.  The admission to the palace was five dollars and the tour just three dollars.  I loved the Secret Garden!  I was amazed at how large it was, the tour takes 90 minutes.  English tours are limited, so I recommend coming early.  It's like a living history lesson learning about the kings and their lives.  I did not take the palace grounds tour, but I've no doubt it would be interesting."
164,5.0,"It reminded me of the forbidden city in Beijing. Beautifully laid out, stunning craftsmanship, interesting history and incredible location with the hills in the background."
165,4.0,despite a lot of tourists and locals all around there's places to enjoy the solitude. also the secret gardens worth the walk
166,5.0,"I went to this place on a whim and found it breathtaking. I highly recommend the ""Secret Garden"" tour but you have to book that in advance. I was lucky to find a tour guide who had extra tickets and was willing to sell me one for original price, not scalped. I also went in the fall and the leaves were BEAUTIFUL!"
167,5.0,"This palace, the secondary residence of the Josun dynasty, has a less regular layout and better conforms to the ground and the surrounding. It is also more simple then the main palace and for this reason it has a quite beauty. The secret garden is a must visit."
168,5.0,A step back in time to a classic era...the palace and grounds are a must see. Just walking around the manicured parks you can get a real flavour of times passed and the culture that surrounds you.
169,4.0,Beautiful surroundings and buildings...very similar to China palaces. Would really have loved to go in the Secret Garden but you need to be part of a guided tour to do this...why? Visited in November and the tree colours were spectacular...just wished we could have got full access.
170,4.0,"This is the second palace built in the 1400s. May of these buildings were also destroyed by the Japanese in 1910, but several also survived, and this is the complex that the last King and his court occupied before the demise of the empire with the invasion by Japan. The building style is very similar to the 1st palace, Gyeongbukgung, but has several interesting features, including in-floor heating systems and the Secret garden. The English tour was worth it (no real extra cost)."
171,5.0,"Close to Gyeongbok palace complex, this palce complex was also the victim of a number of fires. What has been reconstructed is gorgeous, tho. A pamphlet accompanies admission, and, once again, it pays to review it. There is a separate admission fee to tour the ""Secret Garden."" No one is allowed into this area without a guide (free with price of admission). Once inside, you can wander around on your own, or stay with the group. The garden requires a lot of walking. Again, comfortable shoes are a must. There are lovely buildings, examples of a wealthy noble's house, a tea house, a library, as well as 300 yr. old specimen trees. When the weather is hot, this garden affords a chance to sit and cool off while looking at lovely architecture in nature."
172,4.0,"The Palace is great, i like the decorations and the buildings, and the most amazing part, is changing the guards, it's so nice.No way to go Seoul without visiting it."
173,5.0,Worth a visit to get an idea of Korean history. The guide was excellent and the visit lasted about one hour.
174,4.0,"You can stretch your legs, walk around outside, and forget you are in a very big city. Take the guided tour. Nothing too exciting, but it is beautiful, and an oasis of peace in this large city. I fell in love with my gorgeous tour guide, LOL."
