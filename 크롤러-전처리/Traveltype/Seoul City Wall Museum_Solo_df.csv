0,5.0,"Located right next to the subway station at Dongdaemun, the museum and city wall don’t immediately stand out against the Seoul’s modern backdrop of cafés and commerce. However after climbing up one of Seoul’s trademark killer slopes, the Doseong Museum holds a treasure trove of historical information and objects, which show the incredibly rapid foundation and evolution of the city as seen through its surrounding wall. Built to demarcate the city of Seoul (at first named Hanyang) from the surrounding countryside, a local guide first showed us around the three floors of the City Wall Museum itself, which includes a range of interactive exhibits showing how the wall was built and rebuilt by different rulers over the years, before restoration began at the end of the twentieth century.Having had an overview of the construction of the wall, our guide took us out to trek up the wall to Namsan, stopping at points as we went along to point out how Seoul had expanded beyond the original limits of the city and showing us how the different brickwork that you could see on the wall corresponded to different eras of Korean history. Since 90% of the wall has been rebuilt, our guide told us it would take over ten hours to walk all the way around, so we only completed about an hour of the hike, which took us through some beautiful parts of the city, with really good views of the sprawl of the city as well as of the mountains which surround it.As someone who missed this tourist spot the first-time round, I would say this is a must-visit for any tourist coming to Korea and interested in Korean history. As long as the weather is good, visiting the museum and the wall is a great way to get in some exercise, see some amazing scenery and learn more about the transformation of the city. Picture creds: myself and Funday Korea."
1,4.0,This museum is off the beaten path and honestly I stumbled onto it as I was following the wall.It's a great museum that describes not only the construction of the wall as other museums do but the approach to managing and maintaining it.There are lots of interesting exhibits and artifacts. Sadly like most museums in Seoul there is not much material that has been translated to English so you read headlines and guess the rest.
2,4.0,"Small museum over 3 floors which informs you on the history of the city wall. Details various construction methods over numerous rebuilds, reason for wall, etc. Free museum that is well done with both Korean and English descriptions.  A section of the wall is located near the museum which is also worth walking with many views over Seoul. However, take water, as there is no shops along path that runs adjacent  the wall ( shops in adjacent street and park 'square' at top though)."
3,4.0,"Over 3 floors there is an entrance on the 3rd floor from near part of the wall (follow signs) and another door on the first floor at the building entrance. Helpful staff and a good map of the whole wall and the access points to walk it. Good information on the wall, how it is built and maintained by different dynasties. Unless you are interested in the wall, then probably not worth a special trip but if you are in the area then drop in. Free."
4,4.0,"Since the title seemed interesting, I ventured to this museum and was pleasantly surprised. Apparently the museum was just renovated in November--great exhibits outlining the history of the great wall surrounding ancient Seoul. Learned a terrific amount about everything from all the gates, wall composition, and history! Fun surprise--very helpful staff to answer questions."
