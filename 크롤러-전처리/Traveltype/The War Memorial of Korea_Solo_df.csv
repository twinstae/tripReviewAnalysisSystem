1,5.0,"I decided to visit the museum at the last minute and it ended up being the highlight of my visit to Seoul.One floor was about Korean military history up to the Korean War and another floor was focussed on the Korean War. The displays and commentary were perfect - they gave enough detail without overloading you with information. It was very, very well done.Inside and outside of the museum there were displays of military equipment from both sides of the conflict."
2,5.0,"I've never seen a war museum with such a big set up. Walked around for a few hours to see everything. The tanks, airplanes, helicopters outside are amazing and lots of history and displays inside. Also lots of videos available in English or with English subs."
3,5.0,11am and 2om English tour is a MUST! It is an amazing museum but it was made memorable with the story telling and explanation from the tour guide. I truly enjoyed my visit and I wish I have taken the guide at every museum I visit in Korea!  Btw the guide is only for the 2nd
4,5.0,Most notable is the section on the Korean War. We hope it doesn't happen again. Also for the new generations of Koreans to remember the sacrifice other nations gave to preserve their democracy.
5,4.0,"Super interesting museum about Koreas wars. Not only the Korean War, but also some before it. The only thing is that if you go alone, without audioguide or guide, you won’t understand much, since 95% of the things are in Korean."
6,5.0,"Wow !  Was totally surprised when I visited the War Museum of Korea.   Amazing history of the country from the beginnings of time.  A lot of detail, military weapons , dress and history.   Very nicely displayed.  Recommend for the history enthusiast."
7,5.0,A must place to visit if you want to know more about what happened before and during the Korean war. Quite moving displays and a lot of information given. All Allied countries who joined in this war (including the Philippines) are also honored in this museum.The military history of Korea is also displayed here.
8,5.0,38th parallel means more with the museumthe flags reminded me of the unity behind any Olympics go thru the comparison between the north and south armaments before the u.n. intervened.  massacres. surprise attacks.  and the similarities with the Vietnam war.
9,5.0,"The exhibitions were interesting. They open until 10 pm every Tuesday. Don't miss the 4D show on 2nd floor. Very easy to come here, just take the sybway to Samgakji Station, Exit 12."
10,4.0,"A must see for military history buffs, take you through centuries of Korean history, with a entire floor and a half dedicated to Korean War."
11,4.0,Interesting War Memorial even I prefer some other time instead of the Korean War.But really organized and well presented and well served by busses and others public services.You can enjoy your visit.
12,4.0,"This was a really interesting visit, especially for someone like me who wasn't familiar with the situation in Korea prior to The Korean War. You could spend hours at this place as there's not only the indoor exhibition hall but stuff to see outdoor (eg memorial, planes/submarines)."
13,4.0,"This is a great place to understand the history of Korea, dating right back to 900BC! Entry is free. You can get here via Samjaki station and you enter on the South side.One full days itinerary could be:1. Was memorial2. National Museum of Korea3. Ichon Hangang riverside park4. Seoul national cemetery"
14,5.0,This is a 3F museum with history inside and outside with the inside including history from the dawn of the korean people to the current day practically after the separation of the two Koreas. There is so much information I didnt see it all. Outside there are flags for each country that helped South Korea in the war against the communists and inside includes info on the communist allies China and Russia under stalin. The outdoor exhibits include old war vehicles and giant statues and reliefs of people / soldiers. I can't express what's really inside except that it is a really informative memorial/museum. Entry is free. Lockers provided and a cafe inside.
15,5.0,"Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones I've visited or know of, all are well presented. It seems little is spared to put on a hood, high quality show. The National War Museum is no different. It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War. You'd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive. But a proud and sophicated nation. There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere. I've seen pictures of the turtle boat, but to sea in person is a nice experience. Yes is a scaled replica, but it's still impressive. There is also the large outdoor display. With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks. Also other retired items of hardware. You'd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere, but all free in Seoul. There is a B52 bomber, which is smaller than I thought. At the time of my visit, done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance. There are plenty of toilets, most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop. You can spend a fair few hours here."
16,4.0,"Visited here for two hours and I wish I’d been able to spend more time. Very impressive memorial with lots of displays covering centuries of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Goes well back in time, not just focusing on the Korean War. Great displays everywhere."
17,5.0,"Sadly, Korea's history has been marred with warfare over the centuries.  But this museum is a great collection of this history with artifacts, interactive displays, and panoramas that take the visitor to some of these battles.  Also interesting to note are some of displays on the modern ROK military which is one of the strongest in the world.  The vastness of the museums reminds me of the Museum of the Great Patriotic War (WWII) in Moscow."
18,5.0,"Huge collection, spanning early Korean history to most recent conflict in the Gulf.  As expected, there is a significant focus on the Korean War, but there is much, much more.  The outdoor exhibits are extensive, including a B52D from the Vietnam War.  The memorials are particularly meaningful  and well done.  There are many interactive exhibits, and plenty of English signage. This is easily a half-day visit, especially if you are interested in military conflict and Korean history.  Provides great imsight to military history on the Korean Peninsula.  Free entry. Easily the best war museum and memorial I have visited."
19,5.0,"Excellent, very educational place to visit. Free admission. Be prepared to spend about 3 hours there. It is about 5 to 10 minutes from the subway station. The signage at the subway station exit is not so clear though, can certainly be improved. The museum is huge. At the lawn outside, there are exhibits of planes and a replica of a submarine. Inside the museum there are lots of war relics and artifacts along with informational/educational descriptions.Poignant/touching/chilling moments for me: (1) the Statue of Brothers, depicting 2 brothers hugging each other, who fought for the opposite sides (as South Korea vs. North Korea soldiers); (2) the inscribed near the main entrance that said “if you want peace, remember war”; (3) strolling through the Memorial Hall honoring the Korean war soldiers. In the UN soldiers section, names of USA soldiers far outnumbered those of other countries. It said that is a copy of the Washington DC’s Korean War Memorial. I don’t quite remember if I saw that during my DC visit, so those who have recollections of both places can perhaps comment."
20,5.0,"For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War, you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam. However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China.The museum doesn't just focus on the Korean war - it highlights how Korea fought in wars during the ancient days, and its involvement in modern day conflicts. I joined a free guided tour in the morning. Although the tour guide's English was quite accented, he was very enthusiastic about what he was talking about."
21,4.0,"Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings.Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft, rockets and fighting vehicles that you could get up close to and peer inside.  A number of the armored personnel carriers were open but you could not go in.  Sets of stairs were brought next to a cobra helicopter so you could see inside the cockpit.  The PKM357 ship from the 2002 Battle of Yeonpyeong is displayed here with red paint detailing every area damaged during the battle.  This was the only display where you were allowed to climb onboard and see the bridge, deck and guns up close and learn more about the battle that killed South Korean seamen.As I walked up to the entrance, there were a number of black pillars dedicated to the UN and other countries that came to South Korea's defense during the Korean War.  In addition along the walkways to the side of the main entrance were large plaques with all of the names of soldiers from around the world who died in the war.  It was a lot of recognition and honor.Once I entered the museum, it turned out to be a lot larger than I anticipated. The bottom floor contained details about each kingdom’s armies and battles and went into size, arms, skills and success.  In the central courtyard were wooden replicas of early Korean warships.  The top two floors went into extensive review of the Korean War with 4D movies, dioramas and artifacts.  Additional planes, limosines and arms were also displayed.Unfortunately I ran out of time but one could easily spend 2-3 hours here."
22,5.0,"Great, free, museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times.  I spent 2.5 hours here and still didn't see, read everything.  A wonderful mix of multi-media (movies, actual US/ROK and captured equipment, wax museum like staging, and other artifacts.  If I get back, I would visit again and review from current 3rd floor to ancient times 1st floor. Save some time for outdoor equipment."
23,4.0,It's huge and they have put in a massive amount of time and money.If you are interested in this kind of stuff allow a full day. If not spend an hour or two and see what you want.Probably the most informative museum in the area and its all free.
24,5.0,There is a lot to see at this museum there are old tanks and aircraft and more on the outside and inside There is no fee to this museum and it can easily take a day to see everything They give you a lot of historical information on Korea and the US and it is near Yongsan US military base that will be closing soon so I made visiting both of them a day trip
25,4.0,"As I had some free time left in Seoul, the War Memorial seemed a good place to visit as a follow-up to visiting the DMZ. Although I'm not really interested in military history, I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula and an expression of hope for the future. To be honest, I found it all a little unsettling, but it's very well presented and there is an area for kids to learn the history. There's also a wide-ranging display of military aircraft, tanks, missiles, etc, that you can get up close to. Worth a visit, even if military history isn't your thing. Free entry."
26,5.0,"I visited this as a last minute decision, heard the announcement on the hop-on-hop-off bus and figured I would check it out. It turned out to be a good decision. The museum is very modern and well organized with a lot more exhibits than I ever expected.There are 3 floors inside with exhibits from the Korean conflict as well as details of the Korean Military's contributions to other endeavours such as the Vietnam Conflict. Very well done.The thing that really impressed me was the outdoor exhibit with US, ROK, and Soviet weapons many of which I hadn't seen before. It is quite a size and includes a B-52 and an entire Patrol Gunboat. As a final touch many of the tanks are surrounded by lovely flowers which somehow seems appropriate for a hope for peace.There was no admission charge."
27,5.0,"Excellent museum - It's part memorial part museum.While there is always some sombre moments visiting a war memorial, I found this one to be very well designed and tourist friendly. It tells the story with easy to follow layout and exhibitions.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in war in general or the Korean war in particular.You could run through in an hour but I'd recommend at least a few hours to take it all in."
28,5.0,"This was my highlight in my trip to SEOUL. Fantastic military equipments on the outside and very informative musseum on the inside. Btw, admission is free."
29,5.0,"Covers everything from thousands of years ago to the present conflict, with a surprising amount of depth in any area. Would be good for kids or especially for adults."
30,3.0,"This monumental building is indeed a monument or memorial, and does not include a lot of guns and other military hardware. This contrasts with the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which despite its name, is mostly filled with the machinery of war. More English lsnguage captions would be useful"
31,5.0,"I loved this museum. It was beautiful, emotional, and respectful. I felt so empowered and in love with the Korean people after visiting."
32,5.0,"I’m a huge of General history, so this place hit the spot. And it’s free! There are warring vehicles outside the museum and a little bit more inside. The place is massively huge and it may take a full day to finish the entire place. There are a couple of 4d theaters with limited seatings with scheduled times, make sure u get to each theater a bit earlier to save a seat! The exhibits covers history of the early AD, as well as the Korean War. There are videos, documents, pictures, artifacts, theaters. Definitely learned a great deal about Korean history!"
33,5.0,"This museum is great place to gain a good perspective on the history of warfare on the Korean peninsula as well as the Republic of Korea's involvement in warfare elsewhere (Vietnam, etc.).  The museum often has guided tours and offers self-paced tours with recorded explanations in a variety of languages available for use.  The museum is large and exhibits are extensive so you should allot no less than 2-3 hours to do the place justice.  I was there a half day and still sort of rushed through a couple of areas.  This museum is only a couple of subway stops from the Korean National Museum so you could easily spend an entire day experiencing these two museums."
34,5.0,I lived in Seoul for five years and visited the Memorial several times and went on the narrated tour.  The tour was great. Don't worry if you don't speak Korean the tour is given in multiple languages. It gives a real insight of the Korean War and the suffering the Koreans endured and how numerous country stepped up and defended South Korea and fought along side their army.
35,4.0,The museum is located in Yongsan-dong. The exhibit contains the military history of Korea. It has indoor and outdoor displays. It was built to commemorate the sacrifice of patriotic martyrs during the Korean war.
36,5.0,"I heard about this museum from a fellow American staying at my hotel, and I'm so glad I was able to visit it during my time in Seoul. The history of the Korean War is tragic and complicated, and the museum does a great job at explaining what happened and how it continues to reverberate. The ground of the museum are also huge with airplanes, tanks, and weapons from the era. A must-see for any history buff."
37,5.0,"This place is located near to National Museum of Korea. No entry fee which is the best thing.This is one of the best war museum I've ever visited. Lot of informative stuff, 4D movies for experience. You get to see actual stuff used in Korean war. A must visit place."
38,4.0,"It was nice. I feel like I went back in time. You can see how war affected people then, and still today. So many lives were lost, and I feel nostalgic going here. The layouts of the sections of the history were easy to navigate. I like how the rooms connected to each other. It was free entrance, and you can spend a whole day here."
39,4.0,"A very good place to learn about war in Korea. But the downside is that since the visual is kind of real and they make the wax image and all, it can be kind of depressing once you visited the museum. But still it really worth visiting~!"
40,5.0,"The museum is quite huge. It is split in many parts, with one part focused on the World War II. The museum is entirely translated in English, and there's various documents and items that are available to see."
41,5.0,"...the best historical museum in the world.  Certainly the best one I’ve been to.  Epic!!!  If you’re like me and want to study and read most of the displays in a museum, you’ll need at least a whole day here.  For some reason, I especially liked the ones on Korean participation in the Vietnam War.   Somehow, the curator was able to put past the horrors of war and honor the soldiers and citizens of Korea.   I was fascinated the whole time I was here which was much longer than planned.  If I have any criticism of this place, a more nuanced perspective in North Korea’s participation is needed.  The displays of wars prior to the partition of the country remind us they are an integral part of the Korean story."
42,4.0,"Visited on 12/1/2019 after a tour of the DMZ in the morning. The Korean War is a conflict that doesn't get much attention in the West, perhaps being forgotten due to its proximity to WW2. This free museum has English translations and is spread across three floors. It goes into detail about the history of Korea and then the origins of the Korean War and the aftermath. At the moment there is also an exhibition about the relationship between SK and the US, as it has reached its 65th anniversary. A very interesting place to spend an afternoon, definitely recommended for anyone who's interested in post-WW2 history."
43,5.0,"Growing up in former Yugoslavia and going through war in the '90 visiting this museum was very emotional for me. I was planning to stay there for 2 hours max and in the end I stayed 5 hours! Definitely a must to visit and to learn more about what ideology can do to one group of people! My prayers are with brave Korean people and I hope that situation on Korean península will be resolved in future. No entrance fee and even if there was one I would pay it gladly. Visit, visit, visit!"
44,5.0,"I'm not joking when I say that. This place doubles as both a military museum with dozens of exhibit tanks, helicopters, aircraft and ships that make military history nerds like myself giggle with glee, and a grand, sombre memorial to the events that literally shaped the founding of the nation. The exhibits chronicle Korea's history of invasion by foreign states, its drive for self-determination, and its fight to survive against its northern neighbour in the Korean War of 1950-53. The exhibits make many boasts of how the nation must be strong to ensure its safety, but they never stray anywhere near nationalist or jingoistic themes. If anything, they serve to underscore the true destruction that war brings, and that whilst it is never wrong to fight for the right cause, the experience of war itself is something that should never be venerated or glorified.I spent almost 3 hours here - one completely lost in the maze of the vehicle yard outside, and the other 2 in the gargantuan memorial building itself. It was easy to navigate, and although admission was free, I made a donation at the end of my visit because of how immensely impressed I was with the experience. If you're in Seoul and want to get a better understanding of South Korea's recent history, this is something you cannot miss."
45,5.0,"This museum is very modern, visual an incredibly informative. Unfortunately, as a Hungarian citizen, we don't learn much about Korean history so I am very glad that I have visited The War Memorial. I didn't know much about the place, so when I planned my day, I only dedicated one hour to this Museum. Needless to say, as I got lost in this enormous history lesson, I actually used up 3 and a half hours. Very thankful for this experience, I am looking forward to visit it again with some friends or family members."
46,5.0,"The displays are very well done and every country that participated in the Korean War is presented and honoured.Outside of the museum includes several tanks, airplanes etc used during the war. Give yourself a couple of hours to thoroughly cover. Note it is closed on Monday. Easy to reach by subway."
47,4.0,"The outdoor memorial has the famous Korean War monument and the Two Brothers monument. But make sure to stop inside the museum as well, which is free. The museum shows the history of all of Korea's wars. It also has a good souvenir shop with some books in English on Korean culture and history."
48,5.0,"I thought before I walked in that this would focus solely on the Korean War as we know it in the US, but it is a complete timeline of Korea’s tumultuous past. It is a free exhibit and there is a lot to see so give yourself a couple of hours. Most of the exhibits have text in multiple languages explaining the display. There is a lot of history on this peninsula and this does a great job of portraying that."
49,5.0,"Definitely worth the visit, went there on my last day (today) after reading so many good reviews, and I totally agree with them. It is a Free entrance Museum, so there are no excuses not to visit, you can learn and see so much about the country. You spend about 2-4 hours in the museum or even more, I spent 3 hours because the museum was closing (18h00), but could have been there a little more."
50,5.0,Very interesting museum. The Tour was perfect. Lot of new information about the war with lots of items on display.
51,4.0,The outside houses tanks and aircrafts. Inside the building it talks about the different conflicts and the weapons used. If your into war history go and take a look!
52,5.0,"The museum grounds are huge.  Think similar to the US Congress.  The museum has wonderful exhibits that span 2 millenniums of war history on 3 floors. There are war planes, tanks et al outside as well.  Admission is free.  One could spend an entire day in the museum in a casual stroll and still not cover it all.  I would recommend reviewing a museum pamphlet (available in multiple languages) and choosing the exhibits that most appeal to you and go from there.  You can also get a recorded guide headset at the entrance."
53,5.0,"A free museum which offers plenty to see. It highlights the Korean War Outside with tributes to the flags serving under the U.N. Inside there is a lot on the history of Korea. Lots of planes, tanks etc outside to take photos of."
54,5.0,"It is a must see attraction if you are visiting South Korea. Full of rich history on Korean war, world war II etc. One of the best war memorial I have ever visited."
55,5.0,I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the history of the war I suggest to visit the place which is well organized and completely free.
56,4.0,It's free inside and out.   Nice tribute to the UN nations.   Decent collection of artillery and other war gear.
57,5.0,Very education and entertaining. I learned a new thing or two. You can go in the vehicles and planes. Go a bit early because it gets crowded.
58,5.0,"I tought I would stay just a couple of hours here, but ended up been there for the whole day. There is a lot to see and to learn"
59,5.0,War Memorial of Korea is very cool. My brother and I spend 2 hours taking pictures around of the memorial. The display shown inside the memorial is amazing. Alot of culture and history of war times if you are interested with the history of Korea.
60,4.0,"I spent an afternoon wandering around between the tanks, planes and boats outside and through the muesum its self. They had alot of interesting things. I would however recommend going with a guide."
61,4.0,"You can learn a lot about Korea especially how the country went through its rough time with so many wars and battles. If you're interested in history or war history go check it out. I don't think the ticket was even expensive. Pick a good weather though it contains outside stuff to see as well (airplanes, tanks etc)."
62,4.0,This memorial is definitely worth a visit. A great display including interactive and old film footage!
63,5.0,"Only had the chance to visit briefly (when the main museum was closed), however there is plenty to see in the grounds. The memorial is very well laid out and is a fitting tribute to those who have their lives in the conflict. The memorial also has an equipment display that is well worth taking time to see. Would love to have gone back to see the interior - I would have been there for hours."
64,5.0,"I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum two times and always enjoy it. Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions. This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all. Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around. It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded. It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all. There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars. However, you must pay a nominal fee for these. In addition, there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing. Don't miss the gift shop; it has some very unique and fairly priced items. Several are open to exploration and the kids love that! This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus. You can walk to it from Iteawon as well."
65,5.0,"This museum is dedicated to the periods of wartime during Korea’s history.  The entire 2nd floor showcases the Korean War.  You will not experience a better understanding of the Korean War anywhere else than here.  It takes you from the very beginnings of the war, step by step, up until Korea’s military standing in the world today.  There are thousands of displays ranging from giant tanks and planes to one sheet declassified memos reporting on the status of troops.  You need at least an hour and a half to fully absorb it all.  I would recommend visiting this museum twice.  Also, it is ridiculously kid friendly.  There are special events held for children that they seemed to really enjoy."
66,5.0,Amazing Museum you can go back several times and still find it fulfilling. It is very informative and the exhibits were fantastic.The history of the war was well communicated in English as well
67,5.0,This is one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus.  My first time coming to Korea I did stop off here as my last stop for the day.  I didn't go in the actual building but I walked around outside as there is a lot to see outside the museum from lots of memorial statues to various types of military planes that were used during this time.  I got a lot of photos and enjoyed myself.  Would definitely recommend as an attraction to visit during your stay if you like history.
68,5.0,"This is not just a memorial to the Korean War but it also has displays from conflicts on the Korean peninsula from ancient time to present time.  It provided a very good history of Korea.  There were also plenty of military hardware on display on the outside of the building.  Admission is free.  This place was much better than I had expected.  A hat and sunscreen are highly recommended if walking around the outside displays since there isn’t much shade.Be sure to pick up the free War Memorial of Korea pamphlet at the entrance which has a map and description of the displays.  The displays are well-organized with descriptions in both Korean and English.  There are three floors.  There is a cafe, gift shop, and toilets on site."
69,5.0,"A massive war memorial and a great place to take a pictures of the automobiles and planes on display outside. The museum is clean and intuitive and provides lots of information about wars in Korea. It will take a good 3 hours to check out the place. I don't mind going there for 5 hours or so. There is a restaurant that provides food there and so don't worry about being hungry. If you do want to go outside and pop back in, that is possible. Although, it can be a long walk until Samgakji Station, where you will find Korean restaurants for food. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
70,5.0,Great memorial a must see. So many little details about the memorial that you have to ask the attendant. So many things have significance like the number of soldiers the echted faces on the wall. Go and be respectful.
71,5.0,"Spent a good few hours here, there is so much to see and so many pictures to take. Absolutely amazing, the workers there are so friendly, gave me a couple of leaflets to explain the history. It really does touch you.  So if your interested in history I totally recommend this place. It’s just beautiful."
72,4.0,Sombre and wonderfully curated. I learned about the history of war on the peninsula and the events of the Korean War. The outside a with the tanks planes and such was really neat too.
73,3.0,"It's a weird scene -a lot of one-sided displays, some really cool military hardware, juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place. Not really schoolchildren -we're talking barely kindergartners if that... oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive bombers and such.Inside, there was a memorial service for a hero of the Korean War killed in 1953, complete with wreaths, speakers and many modern-day military officers sitting and standing in attention in full regalia. Nearby, a group of toddlers posed by a picture of an island that Korea currently disputes with Japan. I don't speak Korean, but the teacher was prodding them to raise their little fists in the air and shout something triumphal-sounding, so they could all take a group photo presumably proclaiming their solidarity with Korea's claim to the island. It's a little scary... I'm not used to seeing preschool children being actively indoctrinated quite so overtly at quite such a tender age, even in countries where you'd think that kind of stuff goes on. The museum is free, it's huge, there's a lot to see... captivating propaganda for sure. But propaganda nonetheless."
74,4.0,"While on business, I went aight seeing and the war memorial of Korea was a must see and would definitely go visit again. Was a little upset that the shops closed an hour prior to the museum but would factor that into the next visit."
75,5.0,"Having been stationed on Okinawa for over four years, I'm very familiar with the war in the pacific but did not know much about the Korean War. This again is another free museum that you need to take your time with as there is a lot to take in. There were even free books highlighting events of the war chronologically. I feel so much better educated after having visited the War Memorial. I'm inspired to re-watch episodes of MASH as I have a reference now."
76,5.0,"A really interesting, well set out and informative place. Not only full history of the Korean War but lots on the feudal battles of the distant past. Many exhibits of ordinance  Very detailed information throughout for English speakers.The only war museum that comes anywhere near the one in Canberra. Do not expect a quick visit there is so much to see. And it's free!"
77,4.0,"Quite an amazing place. Amazed to see such a selection of aeroplanes, tanks, rockets and even a boat. But then the memorial with all the names of those who died, together with the complete history of the war is very solemn. Well worth visiting."
78,5.0,"This was not like so many other war musems in Asia.It was an historical trip, so respectful to those who gave their lives.No gory photos etc. or propoganda.Sad statute of 2 brothers, opposite sides, embracing on battlefield.Also wall plaks with names, so many. A class place."
79,5.0,"Impressive Museum with extensive memorial.Names of all the fallen soldiers and their country of origin listed.Info in English, free entrance.You could spend a few hours, there is also a cafe."
80,5.0,It put the history of Korea in context for me starting from prehistoric times to current. It made me realise that invasions and wars not only shaped Korea but the whole world.I found it extremely interesting both inside and the external displays of military machinery.Beautifully presented. There are lots of video screens and (very short ) movie rooms. For families it would be a great day on very hot or raining days. Kids would love it --without realising the tragedy of it all .  The station is only abouit 200m away. There is a basic café and a souvenir shop  . There is no charge to visit.
81,5.0,"If you’re a history enthusiast, there’s so much to see and learn from the museum. If you have time and you’d wish to dive deeper into the history of Korea, make sure you watch those videos and some exhibits were interestingly displayed."
82,5.0,"Never thought to stop at this war museum, just because of the jet fighter outside of the museum that you can see when bus passing by that place. I just walk alone in this area start with the all the warrior names. Than start to explore all the hall and this museum is awesome, war history, skeleton of Sargent, lighting for real war situation, 4D 7 minute movie, 3D 7 minute movie in the war ship, all the jet and carrier aeroplane, tanker, launcher and war ship too.. This museum is amazing and they really appropriate their lost soldier and warrior. highly recommend people to come over here and they also give book korean war 1129 for free."
83,5.0,"This place is amazing and FREE! They even offer a free book on the Korean war. You can donate upon exiting, which I did.Outside, the different monuments are accessible to all and in the building itself there are different permanent exhibitions all wotrh a visit. I only spent about 2 hours there but youc an certainly spend more time. It's a great place to try to understand why there are two Koreas today..."
84,5.0,"You'll feel a range of emotions going through this place. The dome with the crack down the middle, two soldiers on top embracing, that is something that will hit you hard.The planes, tanks, guns, etc are great for the kids.The part that hit me the hardest was they have the names of all the soldiers that died during the war. And not just the Korean soldiers, they had the names of each foreign soldier that died also. They were divided by country, and the USA was divided into states. Gives you a better idea of the scale of the war when you have to walk by the names of everyone that died. A good history tour inside the memorial as well, although a bit long."
85,4.0,"I took the English tour at 14:00. I visited here before long time ago, so do not recall what I saw at that time. Couple of years ago, I felt too huge to visit so I visted only the outdoor exhibition. The tour takes alsmot 1 and half hour, the volunteer explain quite well about the details. it is also included 2 short clip, each of them 10, 15 min long. One of them, Jan 4 Heungnam port retreat, this clip runs in a cold room so need a jacket. I recommend this place if you are interested in Korean war and WWII."
86,5.0,"The war museum offers an excellent way to learn about Korea’s war history. It is well laid out, informative, thoughtful and multi-lingual. The grounds are also pretty impressive, with plenty of ex-service aircraft and tanks to walk amongst."
87,5.0,"I stopped by to use a few hours before I flew out, and I should of allocated more time. Covers the full history of war from Korea's beginnings until present time. Huge building, with plenty of interactive exhibits. There is a large number of items to see.If you are interested in history, then I suggest more than 4 hours for this memorial."
88,5.0,"I have been to Korea  so many times but this is the first time I've been here and I was really shocked that I have not visited before. The place was really amazing. The grounds is so big and the outside exhibit simply took my breath away. From the war planes, tanks and ammunition you can inspect up close to the beautiful manicured grounds it was pure eyegasm! the indoor exhibit is a story of its own. the way South Korea preserve and tell their history is really humbling and eye opening. It explain why they were able to rise above every tragedy."
89,5.0,amazing place with loads of things to see. the site itself is incredible and learned loads about the Korean war and other periods of the Korean historywould highly recommend a visit
90,5.0,"I never thought I would love this place! I wish I had more time to read and watch everything. I would definitely come back and spend a day here. I recommend everyone to come to this place if you have a chance. This place has a lot to offer and don't even know where to begin. Just come and explore this place. Not to mention, admission is FREE!"
91,5.0,"The memorial is the best place to go if you are interested in the history of Korean War - you can see airplanes, helicopters and even a warship (which can be visited inside); be prepared to spend the whole afternoon there. And it's free!"
92,3.0,"The war memorial  museum is huge and very moving. Maybe over 1000000 died and for no clear advantage on either side and no clear ending. The struggle of Koreans over 2000 years to have their own country, free and independent, is well highlighted ."
93,5.0,"Make sure you have enough time to visit the three floors of the museum. It is arranges in a clever way to intrigue the visitors with original videos, sounds and memorabilia. And it is free admittance. Great job."
94,5.0,"The museum is full of world war display, ammunition, bombs, equipments, uniforms etc. There are details about how each military from different countries are outfitted, different roles they played. There is also a movie theater for you to watch and relax. Outside the museum, there are many military vehicles on display. Definitely one of the better museums I have been, recommended to all."
95,5.0,"Never get bored visiting this museum, the exterior ground is currently under renovation. Comparing to my last visit they've added a few machinery guns and displays on the North Korean army side. One could spend an easy 3-4 hours! And the best part is it's free."
96,5.0,"This free musseum is great yo know the history of Korea. It has a lot of interactive areas such as various 4D cinemas and tons of vehicles, planes and weapons outside."
97,5.0,"I haven't been inside the museum, however, is free entrance. Outside exhibition represents a lot of militaries vehicles and airplanes! Impressive. You can even go inside some of them."
98,5.0,"I spent several hours here and did not come close to seeing everything before closing time. Upon arrival, you first see many memorials outside and then a huge display of military equipment on the grounds. The displays include a ship, boats, aircraft, tanks, artillery pieces, armored vehicles, and missiles spanning from the Korean War to the present day. Inside there are audio-visual displays, equipment and a wealth of other material, it can not all be seen n a single day."
99,5.0,"This Memorial (and museum) are incredibly done. Outdoors there are tons of old ships/planes/weapons with an explanation of each. There is a memorial wall to all those who died in the Korean war, listed by country and further by US State. Good history of Korea during different dynasties and how their armed services have evolved over time. Good coverage of other countries that helped during Korean War. Very well done."
100,5.0,"good general overview of Korean war. just be ready for long stay, it is really big place, expositions inside and outside."
101,5.0,I remember studying WWI and WWII in school but never recalled studying about the Korean War.  It all helped to fill me in on why the Korean Peninsula is divided and why some of the relationships in Asia are a little stressed.
102,4.0,An interesting museum full of history. Plenty of things to see regarding Korea's history. Recommended.
103,5.0,"This is a free museum. You can see all the Korean War History. This museum has around8 exhibition rooms. Is closed on mondays. And the Subway line 4 or 6 will take ypu there. You can call ahead to reserve free English, Japanese and Chinese guides. Is you love museums and history you will like any museum im South Korea."
104,4.0,"If you have only one day in Seoul go to this museum, if you have only one thing to do in Seoul lets it be visiting this museum, it's A MUST and visiting it will change how you see Korea and will add human values to you.If you are a citizen of one of the countries that helped Korea during its war you will feel proud of your country, you will feel more attached to Koreans and humans in general, and it will inspire you.This museum is great from the outside to inside, don't skip looking at great statues outside, they are pieces of art.The only issue I found is that the guy who volunteered to provide the English tour had a very very poor language, it was so hard to understand him."
105,5.0,This is a great way to spend some quiet time to reflect but also kids will love to explore the displays.
106,5.0,"If the subject matter is something you're interested in, there's enough to keep you here for hours. Fascinating exhibits both indoors and outdoors. Statuary in the photo is very striking in real life."
107,5.0,there are some materials that are really shocking and the history may be forgotten but we need to remember peace.
108,5.0,"The memorial grounds are huge. I spent approx. 3 hours there, outside and inside, and inside of the museum I only visited Korean war aka UN war exhibition. It is also one of those rare museums where you can see a real B-52 bomber. Don't miss a small media presentation that tells a story about a navy conflict between South and North Korea that took place during FIFA World Cup 2002. It is not well known. It is located inside of the navy ship located in the park.I was impressed by the Memorial. Super high quality exhibition. I was also deeply touched emotionally, especially by the Monument for killed in action and by tear drop name tags room. Those of you who have been to Korean war memorial in Washington D.C. will recognize the famous phrase written here as well: ""Our Nation honors her Sons and Daughters who answered the call to defend a Country they never knew and a people they never met"".  Every single name of those killed or missing in action is written here on the walls. There is a deep sense of appreciation to all those UN Coalition soldiers who ""answered the call"" and participated. I also appreciated the fact that the exhibition's main message was not a military success or a proudness in this or that. It was about a human suffering, about the war horrors and, to some extent, about a hope for the better future for both Koreas and for a harmony in the future. Very very emotional. There are a few places to get food, one is located inside of the main building and few others are outside, close to the main parking lot. There is also a museum shop inside and another shop close to the parking lot.I highly recommend a visit. 5 stars on my scale."
109,5.0,"Overall a very good military museum, lots of English translations. 3 floors with some very good exhibits, good details on what went on in the war.Also has modern weapons in it, so definitely ups the points."
110,4.0,"This museum was a must visit for me - I have a different perspective as I have travelled to North Korea and visited THEIR war museum as well.I was very touched by the famous statue of the two brothers above a split globe - one South Korean and one North Korean. The main walk to the museum is under repair so you must enter from the side, I went through the left.I agree with the reviewer a few posts down that this museum paints the USA as god sent, and while the North Korean war museum was definitely 100% propaganda, this particular museum has its fair share as well, research your subject matter, see the exhibits and then make up your own mind. My favourite exhibit was undoubtedly the large Turtle Ship reimagination and replica as well as ancient battle armour and paintings.The displays are quite comprehensive and as an Aussie it was gratifying to pay my respects on the outside Australian memorial wall as well as seeing a fine collection of ANZAC displays.This museum is a must visit, keep your mind open and be aware of what you are watching, especially on the videos with energetic motivational music and short snippets of interviews.There is an area to make your own stamped and embossed souvenir postcard free of charge. Also possibly the only openly displayed DPRK flag in Seoul is on the dummy replica of the armistice signing."
111,4.0,"I had no expectation when I first arrived at the museum but to my surprise, so much history to be learn there.when you enter the place, you can see these commemoratives plates, remembering the people who died during the Korean war in the 50's (by countries).it's quite an interesting visit and learning experience.You can go there on your own or with a tour agency.  I spent 90 minutes there."
112,5.0,"If I had to choose between this museum and the National Museum of Korea, I would hands down choose the War Museum! There are so many things to look at, including a 4-D type warplane simulation room. Also, there are amazing statues outside of the museum to see. This museum is not one to miss!"
113,5.0,"Huge, fascinating and free. The best museum in Korea.Has great indoor and outdoor. Also children museum inside."
114,4.0,"I had a great time at the war memorial, and could have spent a lot longer here than the 2 hours I did, if I wasn't in a rush.It's a really big place, and there was a lot of information along with all of the exhibits. I would have loved to go into the special Da Vinci exhibit as well, but it was overly expensive - not sure how long that will be there for.Unfortunately while I was there, there was a lot of work going on outside which meant that I couldn't take any decent pictures of the memorial outside, but they won't be there forever.One thing to note is that the museum is pretty out of the way, and a long walk from the centre -  as are a lot of things in such a big city. I use the hop-on/hop-off buses everywhere I go, and the ones in Seoul have a stop at this museum."
115,5.0,"It was so much more than what I was expecting and now I'm recommending it to everyone planning on visiting Seoul. Leave enough time to explore this wonderful memorial and to see the countless multimedia displays. It's well worth the visit.Added bonus is the awesome War Memorial souvenir shop just outside the main building. Really worth it. Then, please don't leaave without having a crab bagel at the upstairs restaurant.opposite the souvenir shop. Delicious.Tip: take the Metro and get off at Samgakji station. It's only a 5min walk from there"
116,5.0,"C ( 17.11.30 ) I didn't expected this museum, but the museum was very good to me. There was exhibited many things about Korean War since the founding of Korea, and the various facility and weapon was exhibited. The museum was bigger than I think, and well managed. And I reminded many nation that helped Korea on Korean War. There was good place to know about Korean War for foreigner as well as Korean."
117,5.0,"my interest was drawn on the list od those who died in the war including those from other nations who helped Korea, its a little heartbreaking but i salute the Korean government for giving utmost importance to those fallen heroes who defended its sovereignty!! another interesting areas are the hardware like airplanes, battle ships, tanks, etc displayed outside!"
118,5.0,"If you are a student of military conflict or are interested in Korean, far eastern, or war history,  the Korean War Memorial is a must visit attraction.  It's huge.  Set aside a day for a visit."
119,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea is located in Yongsan-gu. It is a tribute to those who died in the Korean wars. The memorial was opened in 1994. The museum houses many exhibits of war in two exhibition halls. The outside has the larger weapons, while the inside houses the smaller items in six halls namely the Patriotic memorial room, War history room, Development Hall, Expeditionary Forces Room, 6•25 Korean War Room and Large Machinery Room. The museum also holds cultural events for visitors of all ages. Admission is free – but you have to pay for special exhibitions."
120,5.0,"I only gave myself 2 hours in this Museum, so I whizzed around very quickly taking in all the highlights! I would recommend at least 3 hours, if you have the time to spare. The Museum is huge and there is plenty to see and keep you occupied. A very important place to visit if you want to get to grips with Korean history. The 'War Rooms' are curated really well, lots of interactive stuff and video installations. Two 4-D cinemas and I'd really recommend visiting the artwork called The Drop. The Museum is FREE! and they also have FREE leaflets/guides in English so it's easy to navigate."
121,4.0,Comprehensive explanation of the why and how on Korea war. Good exhibits and audio- visual presentations. Free entrance to main permanent exhibits
122,5.0,Large amount of military equipment and other exhibits.    A lot of detail and history of Korea and the war. Tip:  Go on Monday if you are interested in the military equipment.   The main building is closed but the outdoor military equipment and memorial are open... you'll have the grounds to yourself.
123,5.0,you should spend more than two hours there.... I was there for 2 hours and I can't finish everything therethere are too many things deserve you stay and read them all. I almost cry when I read the history of Korea....I would still visit there when I visit Seoul next year!!PS. you are allowed to enter until 5pm and they close at 6pm
124,5.0,"For every trip that I take, it is a must for me to visit a museum. This museum has not disappointed me at all. At first, I was amazed by how vast the area is and the outside area looks very clean. What amazed me though was the 4D theater! There is no entrance fee in this museum and yet I was able to experience it.It's a great way to learn about war and the not so good things that come out of it."
125,4.0,"I normally don't like these types of museums much but with such a high TA rating, I figured I go.  I liked the outside exhibits of the tanks and airplanes the most.  They also have a boat that got shot up.  I did not find the inside of too much interest but I don't have alot of interest in korean war.  There were many exhibits though so if you do have interest in the wars of korea, this is definitely the place"
126,5.0,Even if you don't visit the (free) memorial museum. the vast esplanade that surrounds it is well worth seeing. The engravings of the role call of those that died from all the nations involved is very moving. The actual memorial is very impressive and stands at the main gate.
127,4.0,"If you like military stuff and you are mainly interested in weapons of all kinds starting with a real B52-D Bomber and other aircrafts, tanks, missiles etc then this is the place to visit. I was hoping to get more insights into the historical aspects why the wars were actually started, but got rather disappointed. It's more about the who and how instead of the why (in contrary to the War Remnants Museum in HCMCity). Still recommended to visit."
128,4.0,"On my first visit, I mistakenly believed that it was a museum dedicated to the Korean War. It's actually a museum to all war in Korea, of which there has been no small amount. From stone tools to the Gulf invasions, it covers most everything."
129,3.0,"There's a lot to read about the Korean War.. A LOT to read. I nearly everything, but it feels like physically walking through a textbook. Some of the information repeats itself a lot thoughout the museum, but it isn't presented in interesting new ways to make you want to re-read it. The outside has some neat pieces, like the clock that will be installed at the time of reunification. The 4D movies inside are refreshing, and the historical models look nice as well. Overall not many high points for how long you will spend here. Wouldn't go again or recommend to friends, but to each his own"
130,5.0,Incredible collection of military artifacts dating back to the early medieval period. Exhibits are well layed out and varied and the grounds outside the musuem house a nice collection of vehicles. Did I mention it's free?
131,4.0,"This is a huge place so you will need to spend here at least 2 hours. The exhibitions are well explained, the building is impressive and the entrance is free. Easy to access by subway. If you would like to learn more about the Korean war, this is the place to go. If you are not into that you will find this place boring. In my opinion, this is a place you must visit while in Seoul."
132,4.0,"The War Memorial of Korea (전쟁기념관) is a beautiful and modern museum dedicated to the history of the Korean War. One of my favorite aspects of the museum was when you walked up because they had all of the flags of the countries displayed and have a hallway with the list of names of every soldier, from every country, who fought and died to defend South Korea during the war. I was only here for less than an hour as a pit-stop with my tour group on our way to the demilitarized zone but from those around me, I heard that it take around 3 days to see everything inside of this massive museum. If you are very interested in the Korean War, this would be a great place to see. There is also free admission."
133,5.0,Tis is a very interesting place to visit. Both from the historical point of view and for the exhibition.
134,5.0,"I've seen hundreds all over the world, but nothing like this. So many exhibits (including a B52 or a military ship or plenty of other weapons), so much history from so many angles, so much multimedia including in English, free entry and free wifi. Spent 3 hours there, and could have easily spent more.Way above expectations. Must see."
135,5.0,This is definitely a must go place when you visit Seoul. Free entry to the musuem and IT IS HUGE with heaps of exhibition halls! You could easily spend 3 - 5 hours should you wish to explore most of the exhibitions.It is closed on every Monday and there are free guided tour provided in different languages at a different time slot.
136,5.0,"My first trip to the Memorial was way too rushed, so I'm going back today to enjoy it more fully. The museum is amazing detailing all the wats that Korea has struggled through for the past 2,000 yeats. The displays are excellent and there is sooooo much to see. Give yourself a half day minimum to take it sll in!"
137,5.0,"The place offers a great getaway from hot summer days. It is a nice place with a strong meaning (a bit too strong for my taste). There is a collection of war instruments in the backyard (vehicles, planes, ships, ...). Inside a great presentation of the Korean war is displayed in a nice way with great impact."
138,5.0,"I actually was in Itaewon and decided to take a walk, and I stumbled into the back entrance of this museum in the garden area. I had wanted to go anyway, so it was a pleasant surprise! The museum itself is quite large, so if you're really into seeing everything the place has to offer, you'll need to plan to spend a few hours there. I really enjoyed the exhibits and learned a lot for sure. The air conditioner was also absolutely lovely, and there's a refreshing little cafe downstairs where I bought some ice cream in between exhibits. The wifi is also great, especially since I didn't yet have a SIM card at the time so I was navigating a little bit blindly. Overall it's a really nice place and you'll learn a lot. I especially recommend going if you want to learn about the Korean war in detail, or are doing research. They were even giving out free books at the entrance with very detailed information on the Korean war that would be extremely useful for research purposes. The entrance to the museum itself is also free, they just take donations. So go, relax, learn, and have a nice time :D"
139,5.0,"Even if military history is not your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend a trip to this museum. It is very extensive and interesting with a range of displays and artefacts both inside and out. Leave yourself plenty of time to explore the museum. Best of all, it is free of charge!"
140,3.0,"If you are interested in Korean War, it is worthy to visit. The garden is also very beautiful."
141,5.0,"I probably spent at least 3hrs just looking at things and I'm not one  that is into history.  Be sure to have time to go outside.  Lifesize airplanes, tanks, etc...really neat and you can step onto them.  Would definitely recommend it.  Easy to get to by metro."
142,4.0,Large museum with in and outdoor exhibition. Great place to visit while in Seoul to learn about history of the korean war. The exhibitions are well laid out and easy to navigate. A lot of reading to do though. I spent nearly 3 hours there. I personally don't appreciate this kind of topic but I'm glad I paid a visit.
143,5.0,"I typically do not spend time writing reviews for attractions, but this place blew my mind off.I am SO glad to have stumbled upon this place on the internet, since it wasn't one of the heavily advertised places when coming to Korea, as opposed to Namsan Tower, the palaces and etc. I set off slightly before lunch, and walked around the memorial halls. Take note, that you can spend the whole day here if you want to (or at least half a day) because there is so much to do. The only downside is that the food options here are really limited, there was a cafe but everything was sold out except drinks. And the convenience store outside only had cup noodles, so I decided to walk out nearby to have my lunch. If you are stuck like me, do check out Tama Pasta (opposite the route when walking back to Samgakji station). I believe it is on 1~20 Itaewon-ro. You won't miss it. They have really nice set lunches there!With each increasing floor (there are 3Fs in total), the emotions grew heavier on me. The first floor was the history and formation of Korea, second was the Japanese occupation and so on, and the third floor was specially dedicated to the UN. The amount of people that sacrificed for the sake of reunification and peace is immense, including the UN soldiers whom selflessly risked their lives for an unknown people. And if you like what you see, I recommend that you visit the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan, where some of the bodies of the UN soldiers were cremated.There was another section on the third floor that was under construction, so do take note of that. It will only finish constructions in December. Aside from that, the war memorial has nothing but praises. Not only is the admission free, they have some activities too including several 4D theatres that you can view the shows. There was also a cinema airing different movies throughout the day which I did not get to enjoy, but I most definitely will go back another day. That does not include the outdoor exhibitions that is outside the exhibition halls, but it was too hot today to explore so that will be sufficient for another visit. Beside the information counter, there was a counter of free books (not old, torn or tattered but perfectly new books) on Korea that anyone can take. I took an English copy and am very glad.I beg to differ that if you have visited DMZ, you should not visit this place. Precisely because you have visited DMZ, you should come to the war memorial as it has comprehensive information about the Korean War that the DMZ may not have covered. If you have ONE day in Seoul, and dying to know more of Korea (and North Korea), do visit this underrated war memorial. You will not regret spending your time there. And, don't forget to put in a donation as well if you can to continue this place! ;)"
144,4.0,"A real highlight at how ridiculous war is. Unfortunately it is of course not a particularly accurate account or any information about what Korea actually means when it says it wants to be re-unified. An exercise in celebrating the Korean military. Fair, but not for an accurate history lesson."
145,4.0,"Nice place to visit for undestanding the background of war and how much we owed to the people who served and sacrificed to protect Korea.Also giving lessons for today.Open daily 09:00~17:30 (close on Monday), free entrance.English, Japanese, Chinese guide available (10:00 am, 2:00 pm)Close to Exit No. 12 at Samgakji Station by Metro #4 & #6.Also many bus lines."
146,4.0,"It's a great museum with lots of military equipment, thousands of names on the wall to remind visitors of the sacrifices of many countries, not only South Korea. The problem is that most of the signage is in Korean. There is some English, but I'd like some more. The photos are the highlight."
147,5.0,"The war memorial museum is a must visit in Seoul, particularly if you are interested in history. Focussed obviously on the Korean War but also has sections on early Korean history. The museum is huge and also has a large outside areas with many aircraft and ships. I spent about four hours here but could easily spend longer. Definitely recommend this memorial to visitors to Seoul. One other thing is that entrance to the museum is free!"
148,5.0,"Go early in the morning once it is open, then you can enjoy the most and take the best photos everywhere, especially with those weapons outside, about which you can get very close to them. As an Asian I were particularly attracted to the background of the Korean War, rather touching over some display and stories mentioned there."
149,5.0,If you're into korean war history this place is not enough for a day. You should bring your snacks with you if you dont want to be interrupted by your lunch. There are plenty of vending machine just in case you need a drink.
150,5.0,one of the nicest museums I've been in.   very educational.   the ships are great to look at and the Korean War section fascinating
151,5.0,The museum at the memorial is 3 stories and I spent over two hours between it and the outside exhibit.  Well worth the stop and it's totally free!
152,5.0,"A must see, when you are in Seoul and you are interested in Koreas history. Don't miss it. Big open air museum about the military carpark and planes in the park, also with a children museum.Additional info:- free entry- free book about south koreas war history- informations are in english- broschures in english- regular guided tours in english, korean every day (ask for chinese and japanese, probably it is available)"
153,5.0,"I visited on a rainy day and was a great escape from the weather, saying this thou I would highly recommend this attraction even if it was sunny. great history from the discovery of Korea right through to present day of the history war that Korea has seen. Well laid out it is easy to wander through and skip anything you dont have time for. I felt everything was done tastefully and that Korea shows their appreciation for the UN and the countries that represented them in the Korean war. Very interesting I learnt alot and came out knowing a lot more than i did going in. For some reason not a big tourist attraction seemed to be more locals here, make sure you wander outside with all the planes before leaving."
154,5.0,"I booked one of the day tours from the city center of Seoul. The first part of the tour stopped at the war museum in Seoul. We were given one hour to look at the whole museum and I thought it was going to be really boring and depressing. The truth was it was really interesting and I could've spent at least three hours there. I learned a lot about the war and the tragedies that happened during it.  It opened my eyes to such a terrible horrific war that can never happen again. Good experience,  in all should take you about three hours to see everything."
155,4.0,"Everything is educational about the military history of Korea. It is touching even the monument outside. Expect informative exhibits if you are interested about Korea's past. Make sure that when you go to this place the weather is nice to see the western part of the museum where there are airplanes, missiles and other large-sized weapons. So, if you want to learn and make your vacation more educational, this place is a must to see."
156,5.0,"This is easily one of my favorite museums in Seoul.  Just to clarify -- This is NOT only a ""Korean War"" museum.  It is about the history of warfare in Korea's past.  That means you should absolutely wander to the lower floor to see a replica of the famous Turtle Boat and predecessor of the multiple rocket launcher (which, btw, was featured in a MythBusters episode).  There are some really fascinating exhibits, including an old car used by Kim Il Sung and one of the most extensive military equipment displays I've seen.  There GREAT things inside *and* outside so I recommend coming on a nice day as well so as to not miss out on the airplanes, missiles, and armored equipment just to the west of the museum."
157,5.0,"The museum is huge and there is outdoor and indoor area. Indoor area show the weapon and history whereby outdoor area show plane, tanks and warship. You can easily spend 4-5hrs here. Inside the museum there is a few 3Dmovies. Additional points is the museum are free of charge."
158,5.0,"This museum is a must see, although you have to have an interest in history and war.  It does not only cover the Korean war, which saw soldiers from all continents unite to defend South Korea but basically all conflicts in Korea, from the supression of the Manchu tribes to the Imjin war and Japanese occupation during WOII. Every part has an English introduction but most of the item descriptions are in Korean.The museum is free and also has a kids museum although I did not visit it."

But this museum has so many outside displays, information, remembrances, architecture and honouring other nations that I was still able to spent about 3 hours there. Great to see a nation honouring those who came to help them in a time of need and still maintaining it so well. I will definitely come back and totally recommend this museum."
160,4.0,Good place to spend a few hours if you like history or had kin killed in the war.  There is a wall listing all who died in the conflict (US dead are listed by state).  There are movies and dioramas and weapons.  Don't forget to get your free book inch thick which chronicles the war day by day.
161,5.0,"I really enjoyed this location. They have ingraved every person that died fighting in the Korea war from each country on the walls. The outside displays a lot of machines (planes, tanks, etc) used in those wars. I didnt even make it inside but the outside was great."
162,5.0,"Incredible place to visit,The exhibits within the museum.The sculptures outside.The layout of the buildings.An awesome experience."
163,5.0,If you are interested in korean's history this is the perfect place. The exhibition is good inside and also outside. Sometimes there are thematic exhibitions ... I really enjoy to spend one morning there !
164,5.0,I was blown away by how good this was. You could easily spend hours and hours here. Couldn't fault a thing. An incredible insight into the history.
165,5.0,"I spent over three hours at the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are so many exhibits and I learnt a lot about Korean history, not just the war.There is a lot in English which helped the enjoyment. You could EASILY spend 5 to 6 hours in the museum if you watched all the great videos and read all the information.This is a must see in my opinion"
166,5.0,"What a fantastic museum, interactive exhibitions, including a 4D cinema experience where you can get a sense for how the war would have been. A good mix of facts and personal stories/accounts to learn and keep your interest. Great for history buffs who want in depth information, but equally for families - parents can learn about Korea, while the kids are kept occupied with fun exhibitions, I believe that there is a kids museum section too. Plus it's free!! U"
167,5.0,The statues tell a very detail and sad story. It especially shows the bond between the US and South Koreans
168,2.0,Huge cavernous building for the exhibitions plus lots of hardware and sculptures/monuments outside. If you were really interested in the detail of war in Korea over the years it'd take a few hours to absorb everything.
169,5.0,"If you love the history and art of war here is where you need to come! Over 5,000 years of history in this awe inspiring place. Also if you love tanks and planes there are no shortages here! Step right upto a US B-52 bomber and explore aa Patton tank plys so many others!"
170,5.0,"If you like war history this is a must see. personally, I am not in to it, but I spent 2-3 hrs exploring here without any great interest in the topic! There are loads of screens/ information documents etc to satisfy history buffs. Outside the museum are aircraft, tanks and missiles form various battles. Inside the huge exhibition halls are fantastic dioramas complimented by digital imagery to provide an experience. there are several 4D theatre experiences around the museum- unfortunately all run at exactly the same time so you can't do more than one at a time...it'd better if they scheduled these at staggered times.It was a really well done museum- some information in English, not all."
171,5.0,"Within easy walking distance from the Dragon Hill Lodge, this is a must see. Historic, well designed and maintained, it's a wonderful educational experience."
172,5.0,"Great museum inside and out. As soon as I walked in I was offered a tour in English from one of the curators, which was excellent and focused on 1950-53."
173,5.0,"I was in South Korea in Seoul for the weekend i went to visit The War Memorial of Korea.The museum tells very well the history of the war of the South Korean and he is gigantic and extremely well documented.Many gifts are allowed to collect, authentic objects from different events.I made a private excursion in the DMZ: road invasions in North Korea, It was very short, I think it's too bad, I do not had them time to visit everything.I learned a lot about the history of their war, I loved how the museum was presented. I saw so much monuments, statues very pretty and War Machine it was amazing.. i saw so many cars and planes very cool, i found that awesome ! This is something you should not miss if you go to South Korea I would recommend it to anyone. I love South Korea ! Entrance is free for all ! :)"
174,5.0,"After few days in Seoul and this place is final our my trip in Korea, though the weather is nice during I am here. Next time will stay longer to enjoy Korean food and wine.(Jinro)"
175,4.0,"since my grandfather participated in this war, it was an emotional moment for me. the overall ambiance is getting people to feel the history and the soul of the war. it's certainly worth to visit during your trip to Seoul."
176,5.0,The grounds are full of artifacts and open to the public. Great for an afternoon stroll even if you don't want to enter the museum.
177,5.0,"Like most museums in Seoul, it's close to the subway and very reasonably priced. Lots of airplanes outside (accessible for free) including a B-52 (which was not used in the Korean War) if you're into that."
178,5.0,"This place is absolutely massive - both inside and out. Outside the huge forecourt with various statues is very impressive along with all the aircraft, boats, vehicles and artillery/missile pieces! There's even a USAF B52 there!Inside is absolutely huge, with impressive displays covering every single conflict Korea has been involved in over thousands of years."
179,5.0,"Take a visit to reminisce what happened during the times that South Korea went to war. In case you would like to shop some items, they have an available souvenir shop nearby."
180,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea is a fantastic site in Seoul and probably one of the best military museums in the world.  There are basically 2 distinct areas to the monument - inside and outside.  The outside consists of many different pieces of military equipment used by both sides during the Korean War (Tanks, planes, artillery and a boat).  This is all really cool and in great condition.  You can really interact with some of these vehicles (e.g. Sit in the drivers seat of and armored personnel carrier, walk around the boat, etc.). There's also several statues to commemorate the war and monuments explaining the involvement and contribution of the various nations who fought with the UN against the North Koreans.The inside is an excellent museum which covers the Korean War as well as various conflicts beginning as far back as the ancient Korean kingdoms through the Japanese colonial period.  Lots of cool artifacts, models and multimedia here.  There's no entrance fee, which was also nice.Overall, it's a great attraction which gives a comprehensive background on the military/political history of Korea through the end of the Korean War."
181,5.0,"The exhibit and grounds are extensive.  While I thought the displays would concentrate on the Korean War, I walked away with a much better understanding of the length of Korea's history and culture and how resilient the Korean's are, having resisted countless attempts to occupy the strategic peninsula.  Could spend hours here."
182,5.0,Very nice museum.New and clean Beautiful marble. Lotst of resting places with coffee or snack.I loved it.
183,4.0,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: Korea's only museum that exhibits the entire history of the Korean war, housing 9,000 items of information and material related to the war. Very informative and educational. Definitely my favorite museum in Seoul. There is a 3D theater right next to where they display all the war flights, tanks, etc. It is on a small ship. It is free of charge as well. The Location: Subway Line 4 or 6, Samgakji Station, Exit 1 or 12."
184,5.0,History and relics. A very nice tribute to the vets and fallen during the Korean War.  A moivng and inspiring tribute.
185,5.0,"Visited earlier this by bunking off from a Medical Exhibition.... did not regret it, I added another "" Buff "" to my collection..... I did not have the time to do a full Tour.... I left the meter running on the Taxi... because I did not know where I was.... will revist. According to Chris the inside is very much worthwhile.."
186,5.0,"As this review's title suggests, that's exactly how I felt. A wonderful guide, a uncle who is 72 years old, guided me throughout the museum. It was only suppose to be an hour, but he extended it to about 2 hours. It was great for me as I love history. And I'm very thankful for Mr Sohn Jong Hee's guide when I visited. Pre-history on Korea, Korean War, countries that dispatched resources to South Korea during the War etc. All these helped me understand Korea as a whole better."
187,4.0,"Overall, the museum does a great job of explaining the history of the war. The exhibits are well labeled and detailed. I also appreciated the section dedicated to UN forces who fought to save the South from a Communist takeover."
188,5.0,This place requires a whole day commitment to get everything out of it. It's a massive 3 story museum and each floor is sprawling taking you through the entirety of the Korean War up to and beyond the ceasefire. Just the fact that this museum talks about one topic really gives you a really good understanding of what happened.
189,5.0,"Very nice place,  must visit and do it for full day. Best part is it is free. English speaking guide are available."
190,5.0,"I spent 3 hours walking around The War Memorial, and quite honestly I left this place with deep sadness, and mystified that  our world is being continually decimated, in the name of WAR. Why do so many people have to suffer and die, at the hands of DICTATORS."
191,5.0,"To give ""priority"" once you get inside this vast building are the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors (to put in perspective, the ""entire display area"" of each of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki A-bomb museums I'm quite sure can ""almost"" be fit into just one of the three rooms upstairs here!) where you'll learn or actually ""almost relive"" the Korean War among impressive displays of ""quite-realistic looking"" wax sculptures (especially liked how those 3-D displays kind of ""blend in"" with the big background scenes behind them; you might have a hard time looking at your own pics later to tell which of the images are sculptures & which are part of the background scene!) such as those of: soldiers crossing the 38th Parallel, General Douglas MacArthur at a table with the first South Korean President, a soldier raising the South Korean flag in front of their Capitol building, children learning at a make-shift school outdoors and some reconstruction being done by civilians & soldiers with a background scene of the devastated city - all of which in my opinion are really well-thought-out displays that portray some of the important aspects & moments of the war ""as vividly as possible"".  And to top off your ""almost reliving"" experience of the war, be sure to catch the 4-D show in one of the two rooms (either the Room I or the Room II) on the second floor - an ""absolutely outstanding"" (though only for about 10 minutes) documentary of the famous Incheon Landing (that decisively turned the tide of the war) with the great opening line ""I am General Douglas MacArthur, and I will bring hammer upon anvil"", and yes I can guarantee an ""up-close experience"" of sights & sounds of that landing as you can naturally expect from a 4-D show (the sounds of bombardment & such will be ""loud""!).The first floor though, if you're ""pressed for time"" (they close at 6 pm) after the great rooms upstairs, is where you can kind of ""walk through"" since there's not much to learn at the General War History room (with like prototype soldier & equipment displays of some Western nations as well but no theme of a ""particular war"" as the rooms upstairs), and there's the ""dark room"" for memorial purposes which is just meant to kind of pay respect & pass through; and for some ""ancient history"", there's the big ""time line"" of Korea all the way from like AD 100, the big painting of a battle scene of a pre-Joseon time which is actually lit up on & off for different parts of the painting (my favorite display on the entire first floor) and a replica of the famed Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle boat (a ""smaller replica"", I'm sure though, than the actual turtle boat).And outside the building, be sure to get to the right side of the grounds (the right side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your left after coming out of the building) where there are ""quite a number"" of military vehicles for land, sea & air (some tanks with ""really long"" cannons that I noticed); for the sea specifically though is only one big boat but it can be gone up on board where there's a 5-minute documentary of a naval incident that actually took place not too long ago (shown in 4-D just like the Incheon Landing documentary inside the building as mentioned above).  And apart from those military vehicles, there are two big sets of sculptures (I believe one set represents the South & the other represents the North) with a tall monument between them on one end of the grounds (right by the street actually) straight from the building entrance on the other end and a two-brothers statue on like a lagoon (maybe supposedly a ""hill"", can be entered but nothing much inside) on the left side of the grounds (the left side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your right after coming out of the building) which is the opposite side of the grounds from the military vehicles.  Also just outside the building entrance on each side are big plates with names of soldiers who died in the war (similar to the ""big wall"" at the U.N. Cemetery in Busan although the names here are on individual plates and not on a wall).Coming by subway, Samgakji Station (on Lines 4 & 6) is where to get off followed by just about a 5-minute walk and you'll be at the two-brothers statue; just do keep in mind it takes about 4 hours in total for both inside & outside and the 6 pm closing time, and I do suggest (as mentioned above) to start with the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors; the outside can be done even after the closing time actually except maybe for going up the boat."
192,5.0,This one of the best memorials I have been to. Not everything in in English but more than enough to keep you busy for hours. Even some of the videos had a button so you could play them in English. I had 1.5 hours here and only managed to see the first floor. Didn't even get to see the lines of tanks/guns outside. I will have to return. The building and grounds will also need a bit of time. All this and it is free.
193,5.0,"A wonderful collection, from Korea's ancient history, regional struggles, the Korean War, to modern day. There is a fantastic replica of a Turtle Ship on the bottom floor, and a touching UN Memorial.You can really see how appreciative Korea is of the assistance received by UN forces during the Korean War. The outdoor installations including a B-52, a Mig, various tanks, helos and artillery. There was also a cute family of stray cats living in one of the planes.I spent hours here, alone, totally absorbed, and left with a greater appreciation and understanding, and some tears in my eyes.The only improvement needed is to the gift shop. Some good books in English on Korea's military history would be welcome!"
194,4.0,"If you have some time you must go in the War memorial, is very far from European history (I'm italian) but for me has been very intersting.Is a big place to visit so take your time."
195,5.0,"When I visited this place, I thought this is going to be any other museum and then this turned out to be one of the most amazing museum. This museum gave insights into the Korean War and also details regarding other nationalities involved in this war. Almost spent 4 hours at this place"
196,5.0,"A place to go if one wishes to understand the context and detailed information on the Korea War, known to the South Korea as ""6.25 War"" as the North Korea launched the first assault on 25th of Jun. Fantastic exhibits with several 4D experiential theater shows. Besides the Korean War, there is also another exhibition hall that display the origin of Korean dynasties and history, dating back to the prehistoric era. One will get a good overview of historic Korea such as the ""3 Kingdom period"", Goguryeo, Joseon dynasties, as well as the 36 years of Japanese occupation. A must see exhibit for history buffs."
197,4.0,"If you have some spare time this place is well worth visiting! Amazing statues plus a free outdoor museum with tanks, helicopters and fighterjets!"
198,5.0,"I made last minute decision to drop by this highly rated destination.  Since I missed the English guide session, a high school volunteer, Sally took me for a tour.  Learned the history of Korea and understood why South Korea continue to defend the country.. I feel the pain of the Koreans both north and south and hope one day the history will change. .... may be tough. You could take a walk around the building.  2-3 hours visit will be sufficient."
199,5.0,A nice place to go to remember those who fell and fought in the Korean War. Everything is immaculate. There are restored planes and tanks - any young fan of planes would love this (you can go right up to the cockpit and look in). Beautiful statue - everything beautifully pays respect to the war. A must see!
200,5.0,"The museum takes you through the history of Korean wars, all the way from the three kingdoms period until the Korean War. The exhibits are varied and plentiful and the signs are in both English and Korean. The videos dotted around the museum are also available in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. In the grounds of the museum there also many replicas of planes and tanks, and a replica warship you can explore. I would highly recommend the War Memorial for any history enthusiasts, or those curious about the Korean War."
201,4.0,great experience to know Korea's history.  The whole museum is impressive! It's worth visiting. I got lost when I went there thru Namyeong Station so I  suggest to use Line 6 Samgakji Stn.  exit 1. It's very near and easy to locate. Just a 5 minute wwalk from the exit.
202,4.0,"Good museum. A lot of the text was translated to English. I was offered a student docent. He was not a history student, and did not know much. He thought for instance that there had only been two battles for Seoul. But it was interesting to talk to him to get a sense of what young Koreans know and what they don't know.The museums does a great job remembering the UN forces. It had the names of the three Norwegians who died, for instance.But I was disappointed that there was no Museum shop there. Would have expected a book shop, at least."
203,5.0,"FREE ENTRY!  The museum is mainly focused on the Korean War.  It also had exhibits for Pre-Korean War, and what the current Korean Military is doing and how they have contributed manpower to UN missions.IF YOU GO:  Bring your passport.  They have an audio guide for rent.  From what I could tell it was about $3USD.  I didn't have my passport with me, so I couldn't get it."
204,4.0,"Came here on a monday when it was closed, however the museum was still good. The statues were outside, and all the tanks, cars and planes were outside so you can still have a good time"
205,4.0,"Amazing place.. you can see a lot of memories from the past war.Before you reach the building which you can see a lot of war memorial things, outside you can see first the planes which the souldiers used.Outside the building you'll see the statues of the souldiers and flags of diff. countries and  inside you can see a lot of things like arcs,artifacts,dresses,guns etc."
206,4.0,This place has remodel war machines used during the Korean War. Very informative place to learn about history of Korea.
207,5.0,"This was a little personal.Had just lost my grandfather who was in the Army,so visiting this memorial which had a little Indian contribution in terms of Med Corps during the Korean War choked me up a bit too.There's some awesome weaponry on display such as coner-shot rifles,super soldiers etc and the Koreans are not shy of displaying them.One can even take photos of these.This coupled with a brief history of the peninsula from the Bronze Age onwards including the Goryeo,Silla,Baekje,Gaya dynasties and their wars with Japan and the Tang dynasty of China all make up for an interesting day."
208,5.0,"Impressive museum of Korean history and especially civil war in 1950s. Offers really thorough explanation inside and lots of stuff to see. In front of the museum are monuments for all countries which were involved in the war, of course just the western one helping South Korea. With number of fallen soldiers or explanation how each country supported (army or engineers for example). Near the main gate are also all known names of all foreign soldiers (again, only those who helped South Korea) who fallen in this war.When your tour inside is over, you can visit open air museum with military airplanes, cars, boats. Place to spend almost one whole day! I really recommend.Just leave your political views somewhere else and don't bring it inside - I've met a group of Russian tourists and their guide told them the Soviet version of how everything happened - just telling them bullsheet and lying."
209,5.0,"Must see attraction for tourists coming to Seoul. Not too difficult to find and huge array of history, weapons etc... from all eras."
210,5.0,I like that place so much. I want to visit there again. I wish I could have enough money to visit...
211,5.0,"The museum not only explains the most recent Korean War, but the whole war related history of Korea. The outside has real planes and tanks used during the Korean War."
212,5.0,"If you want learn a great deal about this incredible country, visit this museum! There are some great displays and some moving moments."
213,5.0,I spent a day there between the outside and inside exhibits. Free tours in the main museum explaining the origins and course of the Korean War. The war Memorial of Korea was the highlight of my visit to Seoul. Well worth a visit.
214,4.0,"I got lucky, but on Fridays (It might just be in the autumn) they have a military show which showcases the history of the Korean military. A highly orchestrated hour of the various eras of Korean war history, from ancient sword and spear demonstrations to the marching of modern military honour guards. It's done in a massive circular space in front of the actual memorial building and makes for a spectacular event to go and see."
215,2.0,When I visited there was no audio guide and the smart phone based system is not supported by wifi. In general the exhibition is difficult to get an overview for people new to the topic. What's worse is that it is very nationalistic in its tone and there is absolutely no self reflection on atrocities committed by the South. The North is the big Evil and the South is the rightful Hero. Tastes bad.
216,5.0,"This museum covers every conceivable aspect of Korea's military history, but focuses most on the Korean War and a consideration of the sacrifices made in that conflict. The range of weaponry is staggering, especially outside, where the scale and power of modern technology can be experienced up-close. It also contains moving tributes to fallen soldiers, art exploring war itself and in-depth looks at South Korea's modern military. AND there are parades and shows to see. All for FREE. This is a truly great, if sombre, museum."
217,5.0,"This museum is very nicely set up. It goes through the very old history of Korea and all of its conflicts over the centuries. About half the museum focuses on the Korean War, but that's expected. They did a very good job of showing their appreciation to all the nations that helped South Korea retain independence from the North. Of course, there are things that are biased in this exhibit, but that's expected. Be sure to stop by as it's free so worth the visit."
218,4.0,I just went here because I was bored one day and was pleasantly surprised. The memorial is full of information that I never knew. This is recommended for history buffs or anyone who has a relative who was involved in the Korean War.
219,4.0,Recommended visit.  A lot to see and learn from the war memorial.  Have a better appreciation of the history and the sacrifices of the honoured
220,5.0,"Pros: Excellent collection of war planes and tank, outdoor exhibits are free to visitCons: Lots of school groupsI had a few hours while on a business trip in Seoul, and stopped by the War Memorial on a beautiful October afternoon.  I had originally planned to visit the exhibition hall, but the weather was so nice I started outside and before I knew it, 90 minutes had passed.The outdoor collection of guns, missiles, tanks, planes, and a boat is very well maintained compared to other outdoor exhibits I have been to.  Each item has a plaque in front with a detailed explanation of the item, its origin and history, and it's use during the Korean War.  You can walk up and to in the equipment, and many items even have observation steps so you can see above or inside.  There is also a boat you can tour, set above the reflecting pool next to the museum.I can't comment on the Exhibit Hall, since I ran out of time to visit it.   But the outdoor exhibit alone was a great experience, and with no cost to attend it's hard to pass up."
221,3.0,"I visited the Exhibittion Hall at the War Memorial, Yongsan in Seoul. The sculptures are the memory of the Korean War, the clock stopped the hour of the beginning of the Korean War. You can see the flags and statues of many countries which joined the war. Many special exhits are at the exhibit halls and be able to see the unique ship, called Trutle Ship at Chosun dynasty. Walking around the Memorial makes you feel and think about the peace and war. Good in all season except winter."
222,4.0,"As everyone knows, Korean war is very important historic event in Korea.This place can suggest you historical facts and circumstances of Korean war with selected references"
223,5.0,"An interesting place.. you can get a glimpse into south Korea's past. From the ancient eras to the Korean war. Didn't know that the nation went thru such difficult times...Really interesting exibits on display. From ancient battleship, war gear to modern tanks and bullets. It's amazing. It also showcases old antique pieces donated by those who took part in the war. The whole place is HUGE! Didn't know that a war could be so sadistic."
224,5.0,Very well laid out museum that commemorates the war and all those who died in it. Goes through the reasons for it and the hopes for the future.
225,5.0,This complex is an outstanding reminder of military conflict that has plagued and continues to plague this part of Asia. The war memorial itself is very moving and the extensive indoor and outdoor displays well worth exploring. As with everywhere in Seoul visitor facilities are outstanding with  sufficient English interpretation
226,5.0,"A tranqiul oasis in the city that is informative and also a memorial to those who suffered and those that helped.The War Memorial is a fitting tribute, In my opinion it strikes the correct balance between being place of rememberance and a museum / park / tourist attraction, it also provdes a history lesson and optimisim for the future.I spent about 3 - 4 hours wandeing about learned much that I did not already know. There were people af all ages, families and many nationalities there at the time of my visit but the place is large and well laid out so although there were many people nothing was crowded.The 'park' is large and there are quite a lot of benches where you can rest in the shade and reflect.This is a place to visit that I would recommend anybody becase we can all learn and also be grateful  that many of us never have had to be involved in such conflict.As is the case with many of the attractions the War Memorial is closed on Monday."
227,5.0,It's a fantastic war museum. It exhibits the entire history of the Korean War that showed the materials related to the war!!It takes a few hours for tour so need to comfortable shoes! Must see!!
228,5.0,"If you take any interest in the Korean war then this is a must. Very good collection of military vehicles outside and the museum itself is an impressive structure and experience. One of the best museums I have been to in terms of displays and information delivery. The external halls pay homage to the fallen from the various nations. Pro Tip: Even though it says 9am open, come at like 8.15/30 and see all the outside vehicle displays before the museum building opens to maximise your day and avoid the tourist crowds. Expect to spend ~3 hrs."
229,5.0,"Enjoyed this place tremendously. The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war. Many pictures, videos and relics - all of which provide new experiences of learning. The time you can spend here varies. Personally, I spent 4hrs here because I'm the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit, and stop to watch every show and video. But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly, and could possibly finish everything in about an hour. I guess it depends on what interests you.There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing. That was rather impressive, I thought. By 4D, I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether you're on a boat or a plane. Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits - either by NFC or QR scanning. Beside the exhibits, there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone. The page contained information about what you are seeing, and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it. What a great way to learn!One of the must visit places if you're in to history."
230,5.0,"For tourists in Seoul, especially those from one of the 20+ countries that participated in the Korean War, this is a must see location. The museum has free entry and several guided tours throughout the day. It's really, really large and even has several outside areas with old planes and ships. Most of the museum focuses on the war in the 1950s, but there is a section that talks about earlier conflicts as well. It is a very moving place to visit, especially if you have a personal connection with the conflict in some way. I think it is good to visit early in your trip since so much of modern Korean society is a response to the Korean War."
231,5.0,Had a chance to visit this place. I was surprised by how big it was. The statue of the soldiers in the front as well as the planes and tanks that surround the building are amazing.
232,5.0,"I've been here multiple times (I ran out of time the first time. Second was with my dad. Third with a friend visiting Korea for a few days and finally before I left Korea as they have renovated the basement level (Pre Korean War history).Outside you have a lot of amazing sculptures with a meaning behind all of them and also the majority of vehicles that served on both sides during the war (A favourite was the plane a North Korean pilot defected many years after the war)On the left of the entrance (before you go inside) is the memorial of names for the fallen soilders. Very powerful. Inside you have the basement level which is Pre Korean War history and Koreas first interactions with many different nations. Also pointing out important people within history.First and second floor is Korean War from the lead up to post war. A few interaction rooms/ride things. Also a lot of displays and important things within the war. EVERYTHING is in English (And some other languages) so don't worry about that.Towards the end gives the information about Vietnam, Iraq etc.Sometimes they have special exhibition's too!"
233,5.0,This is probably one of the best war museums I have seen in my life. Great information provided and excellent exhibits! Take your time to visit it !!!
234,5.0,Great place for history buffs. Lots of aircraft and tanks to see. Amazing statues as well. The two brothers is a must-see when you visit.
235,5.0,"It is a great museum, it shows a precise korean history. It starts from the 2000 bc until the Vietnamese war, but the focus is on the korean war. It is great but still has a little lack of english just a little. They givea book for free about the korean war. The best is that there is no entrance fee."
236,5.0,"Probably one of the biggest and best war museums that I have seen.  Better than Te Papa in Wellington, for instance.  Quite impressive (and free)."
237,4.0,"We recently spent an afternoon exploring the War Memorial and found it to be a very interesting and engaging place. It is not necessary to take a guided tour, in my opinion: the exhibits are very interactive and easy to understand. There are lots of interesting artifacts to see inside the museum, wartime vehicles and boats to tour outside, and some spectacular bronze statues in the garden around the museum. We learned a lot about the Korean war and its heroes. This is an important place to see when you visit South Korea."
238,5.0,Good historical outline of major wars and battles but especially the Korean War 1950-1953.  Excellent selection of hardware outside.  English translations available.  A good museum for children of all ages.
239,5.0,The Korean war museum was a place of full respect and had all the nation's that help them in the Korean war in 1956. The museum was broken up into several sections including history from the early years leading right up to the current history of the nation. This place has some great areas for kids and even a small shooting range they can go and play and pretend to shoot M16 and some other weapons in a mock shooting gallery. The Expeditions are well designed with plenty of interactive displays. This museum is designed for kids and adults and it has a lot of English translated information and you can get headphones that you can use to walk through out the place getting a full understanding of what you are looking at at. It also had a full Parade with all different types of services the parade was absolutely brilliant and I must say was the highlight of my trip in Korea it went for about 45 mins and after you could go down and speak with these people have a talk to them and even get a few photos if you like. This place was really a great area to go and explore and actually had to do it over 2 days as a was too much to see in one.
240,5.0,"The War Memorial Museum is one of the best museums I've seen. It's very well put together and is very informative. I would suggest keeping an open mind as there is a fair bit of propaganda as well, but that goes without saying in South Korea. All in all, excellent opportunity more about the war and the history of the South Korean military."
241,4.0,"Had a brief visit here. It portrays the history of war. It is well maintained. The collection includes tanks, aeroplanes, ships, rockets etc. Children will just love this place. The best part is its free entry"
242,4.0,"To understand nowadays Korean life and people this museum is a must see. The nation with many wars in it's history and the perseverance of the people to rebuild the country as it is now, this museum tells us the story of war and how the country is prepared to fight again. There is a guided tour at 10:00 ~ 11:00 am and 14:00 ~ 15:00 pm with the volunteer guides. I took the earlier tour with our guide of the day Mr Sohn Joong Hee on August 18th 2016. After the tour I visited the cafe and shop and bumped into Mr Sohn again and he guided me privately through the Vietnam war section and the outdoor exhibition with vehicles, tanks, field artillery, air craft, armored car, guns from warships, submarines, radar, etc. This really is the place for the whole family, despite the war theme. You can reach the place by subway lines 4 and 6 exit 12. Or buses  149, 150, 151, 152, 500, 501, 502, 504, 506, 507, 605, 750A, 750B, 751, 752, 110B, 730, 421, 600. Get off at the Samgakji bus stop and walk across the street. I took the bus there but the traffic in Soul is rather congested at all times so I suggest the subway."
243,5.0,"Overall: - would highly recommend- very informative and you will learn a lot- free!Pros:- this is a huge place, so be prepared to walk both indoors and outdoors- many interactive activities like a free photo booth, and automatic projections/shows that tell stories once you enter the room- wide variety of themesCons:- hard to go to outdoor portion if it's raining hard- building is not very new, although well kept"
244,5.0,Needs about 3 hours to see wellA worth while objective in depth overview of the warThey even give free books at the entrance regarding the war history. A true gift
245,4.0,"This museum was free and pretty big. There was also an outdoor park with models of tanks, planes, etc. Lots of children running around. It is a good rainy day activity (if you stay inside the museum of course) for travelers on a budget."
246,5.0,A must do in Seoul. It's a museum dedicated to some wars in the Korean past (both ancient and recent). Focus is on the Korean war (1950-1953). Very nicely displayed history facts and lots and lots of war objects actually used in the Korean war. Lots of models of actual aircrafts and ships and a bunch of real ones displayed outside. Super fun! Take a (free) guided tour. The entrance is free as well. The sculptures that welcome you before entering the museum are amazing!!
247,5.0,"The memorial is actually a huge museum where the whole history of Korean warfare is displayed. It covers from the Medieval period to present day efforts of the Korean Army. Also there is a lot of attention for the UN and the nations that assisted (South) Korea during the Korean War. The museum is very interesting for all ages, there are a lot of vehicles (Tanks, cars, planes and even boats) displayed, a 3D experience and lots of other different multi-media expositions. I visited this place during a rainy day, unfortunately I wasn't able to see the vehicles in the garden well!"
248,5.0,"The Korean war exhibits were very informative and engaging. There are even 4D shows to simulate particular events of the Korean war. I was half-expecting the museum to be all about Korean war, but it also delves into the wars in ancient history, which were very interesting. Best of all, admission is free. Strongly recommend a visit."
249,5.0,"We were on a business trip and had a free day so we visited this memorial.  It was very nice and is something that should be considered a Must-Do if your are in Seoul/Incheon.We rode the rail system over from Incheon Airport and after one transfer it was about a 5 minutes walk.There are great outdoor exhibits (Airplanes, tanks, artillery, etc.), tributes to all the UN supporting countries and those that served/died in this conflict - it is very nicely done.There is also in very large in-door museum (with good air conditioning for when it gets too hot outside), again very nice with lots of history about the Korean War as well as Korea's history going back 1000's of years.When we were there there lots of people but not really overly crowded - wide range of nationalities and ages. Please visit."
250,5.0,"Assuming you have some interest in history, this museum highlights many parts of korean history (from 3 kingdoms in the Silla period till the korean war). Exhibitions are very organised as they go according to the timeline and prettily presented too. They have some 4D shortfilms (for free of course) and some are pretty entertaining i.e. the fighter jet 4D experience. In comparison with the national musuem, War memorial offers a wider range in the presentation of history and a more surreal experience too. Most descriptions are available in english."
251,5.0,"A free English-speaking tour was provided, and the tour guide spoke amazing English. I learned so much about the Korean war!"
252,5.0,"Excellent - lots of great information and great planes and other war paraphernalia.  The variety of planes of many types and varieties used in the war was terrific.  Also, the exhibits to demonstrate this extremely complicated conflict were excellent."
253,5.0,"The most popular attraction here was the tanks and planes available just outside the entrance. It's great for kids and enthusiastic adults, as it lets you climb up on top of a few of them, allow you to take photos in front of them, and marvel at just how huge these things look like close up.There was an overwhelming amount of information inside the memorial itself, so I spent an hour on the Korean War section and that was about all I could stand.Being Australian, it was interesting finding the list of soldiers who lost their lives in the Korean war.Just a tip: don't order any food from the nearby on-site restaurant unless you're desperate for a meal (as I was). I grabbed a beef bibimbap and while it wasn't exactly inedible, it was probably the worst meal I had in 2 weeks spent in Korea."
254,5.0,"Honestly I had no clue what to expect from this visit - I only seen pictures. When you walk up to the museum/war memorial you are greeted with the sculpture of Two Brothers. Already their story is an indication of what is to come - strong emotions coming from sculptures, war equipment and finally the museum itself. The sculptures in my eyes capture the different feelings of war perfectly, from there you can walk to the war equipment used during the Korean War. You walk along tanks, airplanes, ships and more - in the end there is also a museum that is more suited for children.The museum itself is an experience. On the bottom floor you have the general history of war in Korea and it adds to the understanding of this culture. Slowly you walk towards the Korean War part and honestly it left a deep impression on me. Two sentences in the museum stayed with me:""The noble sacrifice of heros who dedicated their lives to the country will be remembered forever as a ray of light"""" Freedom is not free.""Highly recommend this place!"
255,5.0,Museum isn't heavy even though about war. Planes and tanks outside are great. Informative even in English and some nice storytelling. It's big and by the end was a little over 'war' but worth a visit. Also free which is a bonus.
256,5.0,I have over 33 Years of living in Korea and see as many places that I can. Everyone if they have a chance should go there.Mr. P
257,5.0,"I had very little knowledge of the Korean War and after leaving I felt very informed but also left with a deep sense of gratitude. I'm not a history buff nor have I been interested in learning about wars but the display and organization of the museum was captivating! There are many English translations, various formats of explaining the Korean war, and done in a way that was infused with immense gratitude to the countries and soldiers who sacrificed themselves for freedom and democracy.This museum is FREE and is a perfect rainy day activity and is pleasantly air conditioned.Take some time to look around outside - many models of aircraft and tanks. Not only for the kiddies but for adults as well.Closest subway stop: Samgakji (about a 5 min walk)Staff was super friendly.Enjoy!"
258,5.0,"The memorial has some of the most well designed exhibits I have ever seen, and is highly foreign language friendly with audio options in English, Chinese, and Japanese for many voiced exhibits and subtitles for videos. Come here if you would like to find out more about Korea's history in war. Also has an entire field of military hardware on exhibit including planes and boats, a great place to go for the history/military buff."
259,5.0,"I walked in and asked if they had an English speaking guide.  10 minutes later, I was introduced to my own special guide who took me around the museum.  I realize that Korea has been at war many times and how many countries were involved with the current War"
260,5.0,"I was so surprised I spent as much time here as I did. It's well worth visiting. Outside there are various tanks and aircraft, monuments etc and lovely grounds. Inside is beautifully air conditioned and is an opportunity to reflect on the world and learn more about the war amongst some interesting displays."
261,4.0,"Only had time for a brief visit, but the exhibits were very modern and had good English information. The outside has a lot of military vehicles which is pretty cool, and would be especially interesting for children I think. Very impressed"
262,5.0,"I came here on my last day in Seoul and only had about four hours before I had to catch my plane, and I regret only having that long. I think it was my favorite attraction in Korea. Outside there are probably about 100 airplanes, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored personnel carriers, and other large pieces of military equipment. Most are American/South Korean, but there were some captured Soviet and Chinese machines as well. Inside they have a lot of information about the Korean War. What I found most interesting was the section where they had tributes and explanations of all UN nations that sent men or aid to the South Korean side during the war, but there were a lot of other exhibits. If you're interested in this type of thing, I would recommend at least 6 hours for this museum."
263,5.0,"A lot of army machines, very nice place for children to see the army at it's bestFoarte interesant, armament bine păstrat"
264,5.0,"Great exhibits covering past 1000+ years of Korea history with specific attention to military battles.  Only had time to quickly look at the North vs South war exhibits.  Many exhibits of vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc.  Outside is nice collection of planes, tanks, cannons, etc. along with a few monuments.A must see for anyone who has relatives that served in the war."
265,5.0,I visited the War memorial of Korea when I went to the Korean War Museum.  This monument is a sobering reminder of a country torn in two.  Take the time to visit this and the museum.
266,4.0,"I visited in pouring rain which distracted from the outside exhibitions. Otherwise a well laid out and professionally run exhibition on the war, ancient wars and also the UN involvement. A little thin on detail here and there but a great place to visit before going to the DMZ. Loved the limousine of Kim il Sung and the iron-clad warship of the middle ages! And it's free. A little confusing to intially get one's bearings but once sorted it is amazing."
267,4.0,Easy to get to via metro.  Interesting outdoor museum. Good for a couple of hours. Situated in a park area.
268,4.0,"The was memorial is both a war memorial and a museum built to commemorate the Korean War. There are a number of monuments including Korean War artwork, statue of brothers, a gallery of all the names of those killed in war a special outdoor memorials to the different nationalities who fought with the South Koreans.Inside the museum there are also some older historical artefacts including the turtle shaped battleship, rocket propelled arrows and other historical pieces. The majority of the museum is about he Korean War with exhibits of the student soldiers, the expeditionary forces , donated relics, artwork based on dead soldiers dogtags, a 4D simulation of the landings at Incheon and the other war 4D a separate female armed forces exhibit and armistice signing agreement amongst the sites to see.Outside there is also an exhibition area with planes, armed vehicles and guns plus a life size replica of a warship which fought in the war. If you want to find out more about he war this is the place to go and twin it with a visit to the DMZ for a deeper understanding of Korean politics."
269,5.0,"This place is a must for everyone. The place is amazing, full of history regards the forgotten war the Korean war. If you put it in your schedule allow at least 2 to 3hrs it's huge and you should not rush it. 3 levels of museum, then there is the huge outside area. 1 of the best museums I've been to out of any country. Highly recommended"
270,4.0,"Well organized museum. Very interesting and large exhibits. You can go at your own pace and take a free tour if you wish. As someone who never learned about this in school in the US, it was fascinating to learn it all from the perspective of South Korea! Afternoon well spent."
271,4.0,"The war of memorial ok Korea is near to where I'm stay in Seoul, so I go visit here during my last day, my flight day.  I'd check official web site of the museum, noted there is free introduction tour at certain time. So on the day, I just go to the information counter and ask for it. The volunteer who bring us around and telling history is a vigorous retired history teacher. She do introduced how war is being start in Korea and how's the latest relationship of south and North Korea. It is quite interesting to know Korea from South Korean aspects.I do enjoy my visit here."
272,5.0,Travelled the world one of the best places been to. Many historical facts and displays. Great weaponary on show from many wars in particular the Korean one. Very peaceful and humbling.
273,2.0,"With all respect due to those who gave their lives in the Korean  War, this museum is a waste of time. A massive space that just gives propaganda about the victory of 'democracy' over 'communism'. Very little about the lives of non-combattants. If you really want to feel the raw emotional power of what soldiers went through, visit the memorial to the Gloucester regiment in their defence of Hill 235 in Paju, north of Seoul. The only good thing for me in the memorial was the mockup of a turtle ship used by Admiral Yi to defeat the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 16th century. Korea deserves a better memorial than this."
274,5.0,"This museum has a huge outside component with monuments and military machine museum which includes a variety of aircraft, tanks, and missiles.  A good place to learn about Koreas troubled past and appreciate how far this country has come."
275,5.0,"With lots of military equipment outside and historical information inside this museum has something for all military enthusiasts. Leave plenty of time to walk around the outside and inside. If you have time, take the English language tour inside and hopefully you will get as well informed guide as I had. I wanted to focus on the Korean War and he really wanted me to understand who the Korean people were and how the war fitted in their view of themselves."
276,5.0,This amazing museum gives travelers a great feel for the history of Korea.  A history of fighting for their land for centuries.  A country that has been taken over many times.  It has one of the largest displays of military hardware I have ever seen displayed.  Allow 2 to 3 hours to take in the  sculptures outside and all the galleries.
277,5.0,A lot more here than expected. Very large and beautiful. Great history exhibits. Walkable from Itaewon metro station
278,5.0,"A nicely laid out exhibit, very educational and I had no idea how many nations were involved in the Korean War.Very peaceful and you can walk around at your own pace.A big selection of wartime hardware on display outside, too."
279,5.0,"In a country that has had more than its fair share of warfare and suffering, the War Memorial should be at the top of every tourist's itinerary in South Korea. It takes the viewer back in time to explain how the Goguryeo General Eulji Mundeok's troops had routed a 300,000 strong Sui army in 612 AD. There are interesting early examples of Korean weapons systems that had changed the course of Korean history.The Shin Gi Geon Hwa Cha was a wheeled rocket launcher than could fire 100 rocket-propelled arrows simultaneously.The carnage at the receiving end must have been terrible.The most outstanding Korean-designed weapon system was the famed Turtle Ship, A 1:2.5 scale model of it is on display  It was brilliantly well designed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It was fully enclosed to protect the crew, while the roof was covered with sharp nails to prevent an enemy boarding party from getting a foothold. The very small sail probably meant that it could not travel very fast. These ships had won Korea many a sea battle against the Japanese.A large number of exhibits naturally cover the Korean War when Communist North Korea had made a surprise attack on the South, and had over-run it in a matter of a few days. The Republic of Korean (RoK) troops, later jointed by the United Nations troops, had  fought back heroically to turn the tide. It was General Douglas McArthur's famous Incheon Landing on 15 September 1950 that had turned the tide of war, which later moved for the first time north of the 38th parallel .The war finally ended when an armistice was signed. Among the displays are captured North Korean weapons, including a Russian-made MiG-19 and an An-2 transport aircraft. Numerous poignant photographs of the people's suffering form a wrenching experience.There are numerous exhibits on the Korean armed forces of today. An interesting one is a Korean-designed light, unmanned attack vehicle.Outside the main building,in the open, are a range of aircraft that had been used by South Korea during the war. These  include a Cessna T-37 trainer, F-5, F-86 and F-86D fighters, A Curtiss C-46 Commando and C-123 transport aircraft, and - amazingly - even an eight-engined Boeing B-52 bomber. It  is quite a sight.  It is quite an experience for those -like this writer - who had lived through the Korean War.Hormuz Mama."
280,4.0,"I found the Memorial very good with lots of history easy to understand and learn. The videos were enjoyable. The war machinery outside was great to be able to touch and climb in and on for some. I may not like seeing any war occur, however it is a reality that they are some evil and greedy  people and we need to defend freedom and equality."
281,5.0,Really enjoyed my morning at the Memorial. There are several floors and exhibits inside and outside of the museum. The facility is quite accessible and is not far from an elevator from the Samgakji station. All exhibits and video presentations are translated or subtitled into several languages and I really felt the appreciation for international support provided to Korea during the war. There are free luggage lockers and a few cafes and you can easily spend 2-4 hours roaming around.
282,5.0,Huge and well done explanation of korean war nice to see all the materiel outside. Best thing original documents and communications around the secret agreements before the war
283,5.0,"Don't think that this war memorial is just a cenotaph with lists of the war dead. It is far more than that. It is a major museum with extensive displays and video presentations of events leading up to and following this war that ended in 1953. The museum includes a collection of the weapons of war from that period. You will find many displays that recognize the military contributions of many countries that helped prevent the entire Korean peninsula becoming like North Korea. You will also walk away with an appreciation of the amazing achievement that is modern Seoul, a city built from nothing but war since 1953."
284,4.0,"An interesting juxtaposition of  ancient military technology with the modern one, including B-52 bomber. An eye-opening historical account of the Korean War and the international support and participation. Need 3-4 hours to visit."
285,5.0,"This museum will keep you very busy. Key battles are explained with short videos and plenty of information. Several pieces of military equipment, including tanks and planes are here. I can't think of anything more you could ask for in a military museum. Even non-military or history buffs will find it fascinating. The most extensive part is the Korean War section but my favorite area was the area covering the wars between the 3 kingdoms and Koreans defense against the Japanese in the 16th century. Plan 2 hours for non-history lovers, military and history lovers will need 4 or more hours."
286,4.0,"Korea's museums generally aren't the best, but this war museum at Samgakji breaks the mold. As well as a fascinating insight into the Korean War, there are exhibits showing a replica of Yi Sun-shin's turtle boat, and when I went there, they had the remnants of the North Korean missile that sunk the Cheonan. If you're only in Seoul for a few days, this should definitely be on the 'must-do' list."
287,5.0,"I love the history between North and South Korea and looked very much forward to the visit. Had 3 hours spared just for this museum and turned out I was there fore 4 hours. It is that amazing in my opinion! So many different exhibits explaining the build up from the Japanese invasion to the regain as Korea, to Kim il sung's invasion and the support from the UN, down to how the DMZ was formed and for the thoughts of reunification. Learnt so much from this visit!"
288,4.0,Interesting museum with some great exhibits outside including a B52 bomber. Well laid out inside telling the whole history of Koreas past and not just the 1950/53 war. The tear drop made from dog tags  was especially thought provoking.
289,5.0,"If you are into Military History then you will enjoy this site. I had 2.5 hours there and it wasn't nearly enough. Well laid out with a really nice outdoor exhibit featuring a lot of ""hardware"" I found it very fascinating.  Myonly disappointment was there wasn't a lot of information on our Australian involvement that I could see; but I may have missed it on one of the numerous audio visual .  Theere are English Speaking Guides if required but I just wandered around and still enjoyed it."
290,5.0,Enjoyed this museum tremendously. This is so informative and loved that mostly all provided English information. There are 3 D films and so many items to see. Family friendly and FREE!!
291,5.0,"This is a museum about all Korean wars since before history. And this country has gone from one war to another. It is an imponent place from the outside and big enough inside to accomodate ancient ships, helicopters, anti-aereal defense, tanks and others. But what I liked the most was a great panel that shows parallel historical landmarks happening at western and eastern worlds."
292,5.0,"Came here after visiting the National Museum (it's one stop away), and I enjoyed this museum more. Not a fan of military history, but the details of the horrors of war and the memorials make this a memorable and sobering visit. I was there for 1.5 hours so I didn't have time to dawdle around the various individual exhibits/military vehicles outside the museum, but I did go for the 4D experience room. I would recommend a longer stay. The effects are not the best, but it is chilling to watch the clip because it really does try and place you in the midst of the war and imagine the various struggles the civilians and soldiers had to go through. The surroundings of the museum is really beautiful in the late afternoon light during spring, and the flowers are gorgeous.An essential part of any Seoul itinerary, because it is necessary to remember that beneath the glitz and glamour of modern day South Korea, such a war happened and is still happening."
293,4.0,"I visited this museum on my own. It's large and has extensive exhibits about various wars that Korea has been involved in over thousands of years. The largest component is the exhibits about the Korean War in the 1950s. As I walked through the exhibits on my own, I felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information and was having a hard time taking it all in. I caught up with and joined an English-language tour guide and found that to be a better experience. The guide was very good; he was knowledgeable, his English was excellent, and he picked out highlights from the exhibits to show and explain to us. I certainly learned a lot about Korean history from him and from my visit to the museum--I recommend visiting and joining a guided tour!"
294,5.0,"This is a fascinating look at the history of War in Korea.  Only knowing about the history of US War, I was not prepared for how long a society can be at war and still survive.  The Korean people are resilient! There are other exhibits there that we didn't have time to get to.  Outside on the grounds is quite extraordinary as well."
