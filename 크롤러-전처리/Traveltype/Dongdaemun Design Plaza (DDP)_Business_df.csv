0,5.0,A fantastic ceremony to honour those who gave their lives in the Korean War. The main hall was filled with people.
1,4.0,The Design Plaza is an interesting building and if you are in the neigbourhood you should drop by. Wheter it's worth a major detour depend on what's on display.
2,5.0,Visited the Van Cleef & Arpels exhibit. Worth the visit ! Very nice outdoor fashion show also. Nice music !
3,5.0,Very modern and impressively designed and on a subway station and near the Dongdaemun fashion towers and department stores. Modern crafts to buy. A welcome addition to the tourist trail in central Seoul
4,4.0,"This is a cool spot in downtown Seoul. I enjoyed walking around and through the rather large plaza and building designed by a probably pretentious architect with an idea of modernism. Still, there are plenty of shopping options and overpriced cafes :)"
5,5.0,"Dongdaemoon Design Plaza is very famous for its unique design + interesting displays. This monument is located very close to variety of shopping areas, including Dongdaemoon Market and Doota (Shopping Tower)."
6,2.0,"While the building on the outside was pretty cool, there was little happening with the actually space. There was no reason to even go inside it - a quick walk around on the outside is all it's worth."
7,5.0,"Well worth going there to see beautiful modern architecture, museums and interesting shopping places with stuff from local and international designers. Nice open areas to hang around and chill out. There is also a public piano if you want to entertain yourself or other people."
8,2.0,"While the building is impressive, the content inside is less so. I was disappointed in the design store as most of the Korean products have been removed compared to my visit a year ago. I could not identify a clear sense of vision as to what the DDP provided."
9,5.0,"Not only stunning from the outside, the inside offers a huge range of museums and designer shops where you can find design gems from great young and talented designers."
10,5.0,"Designed by Zaha Hadid with neofuturistic design. I admired this place so much, photogenic spots to get picture, or just relax with friends in the evening."
11,3.0,Didn't enter but it is worth taking a look at it from the outside and a couple of great photos.Accessible from underground stations and very near to a couple of shopping centers.It is a vibrant place in Seoul.
12,5.0,Visited this place at night after a brief shopping spree at the night markets.The architecture and design are impressive! This is a great place to visit both for locals and tourists. There are outdoor art installations and I think shops for everyone's appreciation. Too bad they were closed when we got there. Still we were able to enjoy the beauty of the Design Museum.
13,4.0,I visited with several business associates to check out the design and architecture of the building. The only comment would be adding better signage for directions in and around building.
14,5.0,This is an outstanding design and architecture building. The piece itself is worth it by night it looks like a spaceship. There are many temporary art exhibitions which are great to show local and international artists. There are also many small design shops around.This is a must do
15,5.0,Fantastic architecture inside and outside of the building. There was also some fun furniture and a coffee shop to visit during a visit. I highly recommend visiting this beautiful and innovative architectural site.
16,3.0,Its easy to get to this shopping area on the metro.We were very impressed by the range of shops and what they have to offer but the style wasnâ€™t very good and the prices more expensive than we pay in Ho Chi Minh City
17,5.0,It is bigger than the photos. A must see man made marvel in Seoul. Bonus: You have a lot of shopping complexes nearby.
18,3.0,Love the outside gardens more though and yes another ok modern design - It is another pretty cool urban design idea and you will not miss it since it is opposite of Doota
19,4.0,"Great architecture, interesting public spaces, innovative design ideas. Plenty of cafes and shopping as well. Nearby shoe market, fashion markets too."
20,5.0,"Note- the trip advisor map locator is wrong: this structure is located at Dongdaemun history and culture park metro stop. As you emerge you will encounter this impressive structure, known as ""the spaceship"". Make your way through the inside to the top floor then exit outdoors and see it from the outside. Be sure to check out the design lab for funky design stores and concepts. The interior was also dotted with funky furniture and spaces to hang out. On a Saturday afternoon the outdoor space was a hive of activity, great for people watching, boutique markets and live music. Adding to the ambience were the pianos free for local maestros to show off to the public.  Later on the hipster food trucks start up and the cool kids come out for the night.After sunset the LED roses lights go on which is another reason to stay after dark. Tip- for fantastic views from above go across the road to Doota department store and take the express lift to the 10th floor."
21,5.0,"Chapeau ! to the Seoul government taking on such a grand urban regeneration project. A place not to be missed , designed by the late Zaha Hadid -  Grande Dame de Design.  Do take time for a tour of the building. Saw Jean Paul Gautier's exhibition at DDP on a Sunday morning. Amused by the fashionable mother taking her equally well-dressed kids to this exhibition. In short ! Don't tell people you have visited Seoul if you have not visited DDP."
22,4.0,This new building is a very actractive. You can see exhibition and fair inside. It's a futuristic structure.
23,5.0,"very nice place specially at night, and good area for shopping at days enjoy all the site and visit also the monuments an subcultures nearby"
24,4.0,"Dongdaemun Design Plaza is a miracle design like a space Craft. Nice, neat and clean garden inside the plaza. and good shopping market outside. Nice place to spend time. I was there during an official conference."
25,4.0,The plazza is a fitting tribute to the departed architectural genius of Zaha Hadid. What an extraordinary building and area created on the site of an old baseball field. I walked around the shop which is filled with products made by local South Korean designers and creators - well worth browsing through and spending some money on something special. At night the plaza is spectacular (i was told this).
26,2.0,"A hideously expensive building that provides a series of useless spaces. The architect appears to have been total ignorant of the intended purpose or determined to ignore it. The build quality is very good and it is certainly a dramatic sculptural shape, but as a building it is total fail. As this old fashioned shape making architecture becomes less prevalent Seoul will see this project as a lost opportunity."
27,3.0,you can visit this place at the same time when you visit cheonggyeceon stream. it also optional to visit at night because there are a lot food street vendor around the building
28,5.0,"We spent a couple of hours browsing through the craft shops, which contained everything from traditional crafts to chocolates with your photograph on them. There was even a specialised photo-booth where they could create a 3-D model of you!"
29,4.0,"This place is worth a look if you're traveling with kids and/or shopping Doota et al. Pretty green space, nice galleries and a cool design shop that provides a nice blueprint for museum shops to follow."
30,4.0,"The exterior of this complex, designed by Zaha Haddid was both beautiful and exotic. Inside the museum, it felt large, cavernous and the spaces under utilized. But there are at least two different shopping 'malls' in two different parts of the complex: one for eating and one for shopping."
31,3.0,"I attended a conference here and, over the course of a few days, was repeatedly irked by the impractical layout of the place. It seems the architects had little time for functionality when they designed it. Aesthetically it is interesting and, some would say, beautiful."
32,5.0,This is a very new designed building in Seoul. Complete different from other kind of constructions. Many kind of exibitions happen there and it is located very close from Dongdaemun gate.
33,3.0,This plaza is an extraordinary sight but lacks a bit of human touch inside. It is very large and it takes a lot of walking around and through it to comprehend the whole building. Great design shop inside.
34,4.0,"The DDP is a beautiful building of modern element. I think for people who likes design, it is a good place to visit. I visited the place when there is a LED roses display at its vicinity. It is beautiful when the roses were lighted up at night. If you are at Dongdaemun for shopping, it's good to drop by to admire this place."
35,5.0,Really interesting place and a great insight into how South Korea is truly developing its talent. A must see if you re nearby.
36,4.0,"this building design is incredible, looking like giantic space ship ! There are regular art exibition, fashion shows here - so check it out !.  looks stunning at night as well !"
37,5.0,"Excellent sightseeing spot in Seoul, actually one of the milestones every traveller should have when visiting Seoul, next to Dongdaemun shopping..."
38,5.0,"Incredible design. Art center, and shops and subway under it.Great place to go when shopping or just hanging out looking at thousands of people passing by."
39,4.0,"A must see place if you love modern architecture, easy to recognize from the other end of the long street loaded with shopping malls and restaurants. The whole area could take your days and nights if you are shopaholic, btw."
40,4.0,"Very modern complex of futuristic buidings. Inside Museum, Galleries,cinema, theathre, so there is much to do, if you want to see everything you'll need all day and some amount of money. It's different than normal museums, so I think it's worth to visit this amazing place. You can climb on the roof, there is a grass and benches over there. It's in the middle of the city, so it looks like a space ship. Close by you can find very cheap shopping center to buy some stuff ( clothes, cosmetics, souvenirs..everything :)"
41,5.0,"From the futuristic spaceship like design to the gallery inside, little shops inside and markets and fashion stores outside this place is alive both in the day and at night. I was last there for the 1600 Panda+ awareness project last week. I will definitely come back and recommend DDP to everyone."
42,5.0,"The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is Seoul's equivalent of the Sydney Opera House, and is a must-see for all architecture lovers. With a UFO exterior and Gaudi-esque interior, the building provides moments of beauty interspersed with extreme frustration when trying to navigate ones way around it. If you are looking for unique gifts, there is a two storey shop selling Korean (and foreign) designer objects, technology, clothing, furniture, stationery, toys etc. which provides a more sophisticated alternative to the city's many markets."
43,4.0,"I attended a conference at the DDP for 5 days and although the complex is attractive and modern-looking from outside, it's totally claustrophobic and quite complicated inside; most of the days it wasn't easy to find our way to different conference rooms! The facilities are clean and the locals seem to take advantage of the surrounding areas especially on a sunny day. If you have a lot of time to spare, then visit it, otherwise visit the real Seoul and its neighbourhoods."
44,4.0,"What an amazing architeture! This place is well worth a visit, both inside and out. Inside you will find an art  museum, cafe and designer shops with cool but expensive stuff to buy. It is also in  busy shopping area so i would definitely recommend checking it out"
