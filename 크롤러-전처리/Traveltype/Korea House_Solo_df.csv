It is a wonderful small quiet place and you can enjoy Korean architecture without another 10 cameras being held up to capture the same image. As I visited it near the end of my trip I simply found it a great place to take a break and catch my breath without tourists pushing past me."

2,2.0,If you stay close to Myeongdong area it`s worth going there to experience Korean Culture. I advise you not to visit Korea House unless you sleep on money.
3,5.0,"The olace is within easy access to the metro, 5 minutes walk. The dance perfomance was really good and I can't speak highly enough of the performers and thri porfessionalism and deication to their art. The costumes were colorful and awesome. the women were beautiful their smile was more enigmatic than Mona Lisa's. the stage itself was really well set up. unfortutanely it was not well attended and don't understand why? probably they don't use agencies which would swamp the place with noisy tourists? I tookd the buffet dinner afterwards but I hear the banquet would be worthwhile too albeit expensive, You would need at least 3 people for a booking for that THe cost of the bufet was 40000won which was real value for my money seeing I got to tatse so many varieties of traditional Korean Cuisine."
