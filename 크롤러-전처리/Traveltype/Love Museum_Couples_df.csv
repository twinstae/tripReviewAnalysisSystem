11,5.0,"If you don't have any moral qualms to see and play with obscene and explicit life and bigger than life-size dolls, pictures, reenactments, this is a playful place for your fantasies."

It's a perfect place for couples. If you love funny and funky stuffs it is a must visit to go there. At the end when you are about to finish they also have a TV screen where you can scan your face and appear on the TV and then you start with a towel dance lol. It is a must visit place for couples.
14,5.0,"After visiting the TrickEye museum and ice museum, was thinking should we enter the love museum as well and I believe we did a good choice lol.. itâ€™s my first visit and had so much fun.. cool place!!"
15,5.0,"If you want to spend a really fun time with your partner this is the place to go.If seeing overdramatic pin ups, sexy cartoons and take overly funny pictures you should definitly go. This place is all about light hearted jokes about sexe and you can really have fun and laugh about this without feeling akward. Everybody is taking ridiculously funny pictures.Going with your partner will be even funnier."
16,5.0,"Reasonable price with reasonable facility. Definitely recommended. But if ur shy about sex, then don't waste ur money"
17,4.0,It is definitely my cup of tea. Having a cracking laugh. Dont take life too seriously while you are on holidays.
18,5.0,That is actually right place for couple at the beginning of relationship:) provokes some nice topics to talk... Very erotic and I like it
19,3.0,"Husband and I decided on a whim to visit this place and had a few giggles. Best to take someone with you so you can take images if you wish. Its like trick eye museum but based around sex. Definitely not suitable for kids as people mentioned if thats not already obvious, you can see a pair of breasts from the stairs going up so shield your babies eyes! Lol. I was a bit disturbed about seeing children in the artwork  eg- a kid at the top of the stairs staring at a naked blonde woman, and other kids who are featured in some illusions. Overall, nice place to take your partner."
20,3.0,"The museum is in the same building as the Eye-Trick and Ice Museum. The pictures and statues are very amusing and make for great photos. You can finish the whole trip in about 30 minutes. A lot of great restaurants nearby.Cost for a single adult ticket is 8,000won. Not recommended for children."
21,4.0,"It's absolutely inappropriate for children or modest families, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. We went early on a weekday so there was almost no one there so we had the place to ourselves to take a bunch of hilarious pictures."
22,3.0,"I've been to the sex museum on Jeju and in Gyeongju. Wanted to take a friend who is leaving soon, it's more of a x-rated trick art museum. We still had a good time, but not quite the same."
23,2.0,It's not a museum.  It's a sex show place.  The photos were vulgar and only 2 to 3 rooms with some vulgar photos and statue.  A ripped off.  Don't bother
24,4.0,"Inside these 4 walls contain explicit sex scenes & figurines, some in 3D. Nothing to be shy about as we are all grown-ups if you are interested in visiting it. Here again with the nude figurines, it's left to your imagination on how to pose. I like the one with the Mother giving birth to her child. This can be more humorous if the photo is taken with the woman giving birth to an adult friend? Go imagine this and visit it with a creative and open mind; you will not regret it. Sometimes it's quite humorous as we see life in reality. For 8,000 Won or about SGD $10 you need about less than 1 hour to complete the exhibits. Thankfully, children are however not allowed entry."
