0,4.0,"Like Hongdae and Sinchon at the opposite end of Gangbuk, Daehangno has a distinctively youthful and laid back vibe, with shops and F&B places catering mainly to University students and young adults. The area is rather quiet even on weekend mornings, with crowds building up only 4pm streaming into the cinemas and many cafes in the neighbourhood. Walk away from the shops and cafes to visit the Ihwa mural village which has colorful, witty pictures handpainted on the walls of old buildings, returning to Daehangno in the evening for dinner and drinks. Those who do not fancy Korean food or Korean version of American grub may opt for one of several Thai and Vietnamese resthurants in the area. The pubs with alfresco seating offering craft beers, sausages and tapas are worth checking out too."
1,5.0,"It is just 15 minutes walk from Dongdaemun. Many arts were installed along the road which is quite attractive and humour sometimes. Many restaurants could be found, especially there are several Korean Barbecue and desserts shops. Fashion and Stationery shops could also be found here."
2,3.0,"A lot of shops, eg. cloths, shoes, accessories, etc. around Daehakro or University area. Also have a lot of arts halls too."
3,4.0,Daehangno is a nice place to spend an afternoon walking around the restaurants and shops but on Sunday afternoons Filipino vendors sell all kinds of products from the Philippines  as well as some harder to find western products. Lots of street food. Relatively sanitary...i.e. I haven't gotten sick eating any of the street for there. It's only a couple of blocks long but there are many side streets in the area with lots of shops.
4,5.0,"Do you like performances like play, concert or musical? Especially if you want to watch a play with your lover, friend or family, and go to a nice and intimate restaurant for dinner, don't hesitate to visit Daehakro. I bet you will have a successful date. Here is the young street full of romance! It is close to Changedeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace, and also close to the downtown Jongro area."
