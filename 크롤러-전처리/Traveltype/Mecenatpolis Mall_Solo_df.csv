0,4.0,"I don't think it's underrated, it just attracts a different crowd from the usual expat community, mainly locals and South-Asian tourists. Except for the events the place is almost never crowded, pleasantly lively at best. The mall is connected to Home Plus and other supermarkets that makes it suitable for family outings. It has some of the popular clothing stores and some alternative and luxury ones as well. You can also buy cosmetics here, of course. The variety of the eateries is probably the best thing about this mall; you can choose from western, Korean and Japanese cuisine here. They're scattered all over the mall, however, all the cheap Korean restaurants seem to be concentrated in an alley on floor B1. It has a few nice cozy coffee shops too. I personally like to spend time here alone. It's especially beautiful on sunny days. The architecture is also worthy of note."
