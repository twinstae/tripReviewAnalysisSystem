Gentle and playful creatures.The Spider Crab was another species that surprised me.Have you seen the Flashlight Fish? Small fish that actually lights up in the dark? You can see it here.Highlight would be the full screen aquarium. It is smaller than the one in Singapore but still gives a sense of foreboding as you watch the sea creatures.Probably due to the amount of space, the aquarium makes full use of what they have.To get here...Jamsil Station. Go to Lotte Mall."
1,5.0,"I’ve been to a few other aquariums so I really considered carefully whether it was worth while going for this, especially on a national holiday when it was jam packed with people. I TOTALLY enjoyed myself and would say this is in fact the highlight of my entire Korea visit. I was there primarily to see the Beluga and it certainly didn’t disappoint. The Beluga seems trained to swim near to the side of the tank so it was really easy to take pictures/videos of them. Besides, I also enjoyed looking at the collection of strange frogs and extra large river fish, which I haven’t come across in other aquariums so far. Somehow I felt that the enclosures were really well built and gives you a feeling that the fishes are really near you, it is really quite different in a great way."
2,4.0,What I enjoyed the most in the aquarium was the beluga! It was my only close encounter with belugas and their size are just massive! The entire aquarium was very clean. There were lots of varieties of fish to see. The jellyfish section was closed though... not sure if it costs extra or just really closed on the day I visted. I appreciated that the aquariums were huge and can be seen at various angles like tunnels or different sides of the tanks. I just feel bad that all were enclosed... I do hope that the animals have an open environment somehow where they can take a break and not look so enclosed (especially for the sea creatures).
3,4.0,This was a small aquarium suitable for children. I would recommend it though. The price is okay. There were lots of families with small children there. There is a snack bar and a store to purchase souvenirs also.
4,4.0,"Prefer the coex aquarium to this, since it felt as though the former was larger. However, among all stations in both aquariums, I am in love with lotte world aquarium's seals station the most, especially when the seals splashed water out of their tank. Apart from its size, there wasn't nothing else that I could think of to pick on - the staff were consistently wearing a smile, the place was really clean, the ambiance was good.."
