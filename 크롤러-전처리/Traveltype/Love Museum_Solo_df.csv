0,5.0,It was everything and so much than I was expecting. Super racy but fun. Plus it makes for a great story.
1,5.0,"The museum offers excellent entertainment and picture opportunities. Even though I travelled solo, the other visitors were in very good moods so they took a lot of pictures of me when asked. Entry costs 8,000 won and it's definitely worth it. I would particularly recommend this place to people that won't make it to Jeju Loveland."
2,4.0,"Despite all the rave reviews and the pleasure that I gained out of visiting this place I still find the admissions a bit on the expensive side.  There is indeed a lot of creativity at this place and people, in particular couples, tend to have a nice time there."
3,4.0,It is situated in the same building as the trick eye museum and we had a lot of fun going around. Plenty of laughs and really good entertainment. Good value and it really is unique.
4,5.0,Love Museum is a wonderful place to visit with family and friends.located in a great area where most clubs and bars are located.
