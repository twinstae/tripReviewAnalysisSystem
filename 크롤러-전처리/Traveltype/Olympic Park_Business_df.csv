2,5.0,"Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing"

5,4.0,"As a huge, life-long Olympics fan I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. The building and grounds are very well maintained and the signs are very clear to navigate the area. The monuments are fantastic to browse and give a great history of the Olympics and all the Korean medal winners. The highlight for me was the Jamsil Baseball Stadium. I hope to be back sometime again to actually see a game played!"
6,5.0,"This was a fun surprise after a long metro ride. I spent three hours here, and still didn't see everything on my list. There are lots of fun (modern art) sculptures scattered on the grounds of the 1988 Olympic grounds. Not sure if the venues are open, I didn't go inside any except the museum which was wonderful. This is a fun activity after you have seen one too many ancient gates and temples. Fresh air, beautiful grounds, and even a kiddie train to ride for 1200 Wan."

From my hotel room, I woke up every morning to a brilliant sunrise. I rented a bike and cycled around the whole park. There s habitats for flocks of herons, and I saw rabbits n squirrels scuttling around too. The Olympic museum was also a gem and a must-visit. It was one of the parks that offers a lot for everyone from young to old"

From tennis courts, to exercise spots, to benches, and restaurants, this place has it all. I will be back"
