0,5.0,If you are a baseball fan and have never watched Asian professional baseball then add a game at Jamsil Stadium to your list. The atmosphere is festive throughout the game and the quality of play in the KBO is among the best in the world.
1,4.0,"우리팀이 이기면 더 좋겠지만 가는 것만으로도 기분이 좋아지는 야구장⚾️ 친구와, 가족과 맛있는 것을 먹으며 우리팀을 응원하고, 응원가를 부르면 쌓였던 스트레스가 모두 날아가는 것만 같다. 비시즌은 너무 괴롭다😭I feel so good whenever I go to the baseball stadium although our team loses. When I cheer for our team and sing our cheering songs eating delicious food with my friends and family, all the stress goes away. But off season is distressed😭"
2,4.0,"Headed up to Seoul to see a baseball game. Really easy to get to, subway right at the stadium. Pretty good venue, great facilities and easy to get around. Fantastic game and atmosphere with the ground. Had a really fun night, recommend getting here to see a local game if you can."
3,5.0,"Watching baseball in Korea is more about people watching. The Koreans are very into their teams and their players.  Each player has his own 'signature' song and when he comes to bat EVER fan of that team sings that batter's song. The singing is led by a head cheerleader (male) and five to six 'go go girl' cheerleaders. Each team has their own set of cheerleaders so make sure you get seats (which are cheap) to watch both sides of the field.You can bring in all the food and/or beverages you want. But there are dozens of places to eat and drink in the stadium as well.  They have beer vendors who cruise the aisles with backpack dispensers of beer and they just refill your cups for about $5.The fried chicken, no matter which vendor, is always good.Oh, the game???  It is about AAA level in the states.  Each team has at least one American who is either a pitcher or a power hitter.All in all, a MUST experience if you visit Seoul.  There are games every day of the week except Mondays throughout the season."
4,5.0,"We stayed at the InterContinental Grand Seoul Parnas and was a few stops away on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. Very accessible!Food: I'd recommend grabbing some food before you head to your seats. My friends and I grabbed some fried chicken and beer. Once we grabbed our food, we didn't want to leave. Atmosphere: One of the most electric atmospheres at a sporting event I've ever been to. The home and visiting team take turns cheering them on and it was a sight to behold. I highly recommend watching a game if you're within season and in the area!"
5,4.0,"The baseball is the No. 1 sports in Korea. And this is the base stadium for LG Twins and Dusan Bears. It's a good place to feel the electricity.- If you are a newbie, the seat near the cheerleaders of home team zone will be great.- You can purchase various foods like chicken and beer. There's no ripoff. You don't need to buy foods before arrival.- It's an old stadium. Not that comfortable to watch the game, though."
6,4.0,"I went to the Doosan Bears vs Nexen Heroes game on 09/25/18.I'm a Korean resident who has been to many baseball games here and usually I would reserve tickets for the home team fan section using the teams ticket vendor. The Doosan Bears ticket provider is Interpark, unfortunately this ticket provider is very difficult for foreign customers and online reservation is only available in Korean and payment can only be made with a Korean Credit card, not even my trusty Check Card could work.The Interpark website is available in English but you cannot purchase Doosan tickets on this site. A different ticket provider, Ticketlink, which provides tickets for the majority of KBO teams, including the LG Twins who also play at the Jamsil Baseball Stadium allows foreign residents to purchase tickets using a check card. If you want the best seats for a Jamsil Baseball Experience and can navigate the apps then perhaps seeing the Twins is a better option.There are a lot of foreign visitors to the Jamsil Baseball Stadium and unfortunately they had to rock up and buy a ticket at the ticket office before the game. Games rarely sell out at this stadium but this was over the chuseok holiday season, so it was almost sold out. Many people in my block were foreign customers who either didn't know about the reservation system or, like me, were unsuccessful in their attempts to reserve prime seats online prior to the game.Now, most games don't sell out, so the points that I have made here about reserving tickets online won't apply to many games, only for those which are over the holiday season or during the playoffs. I anticipate that buying Doosan tickets as a walk up fan would be impossible during the playoffs. While going on just any day is good, i would recommend you go on a Saturday for the best atmosphere and experience.Jamsil Baseball Stadium usually gets a high number of away team supporters, so the stadium divides itself into sides, the first base side is where the home fans will sit and the third base (in the sun) is where the away fans, and neutrals, daytrippers etc will sit.The atmosphere is good and the fans are loud and vocal throughout the game, there really isn't anything like Korean baseball and I would recommend that any sports fan should go to experience a game. However I just couldn't get into it because we were sat with the opposition supporters and had to watch the home fans, the team I had initially come to see enjoy themselves while us unfortunate folk on the our side got no freebies and were unable to join in with the atmosphere properly.While this review may not be the most positive, it is based on my experience and yours may be totally different and under better circumstances I'm sure you'll have a great time, if you are only in Seoul while visiting Korea then a game at the Jamsil Baseball Stadium is a must. If you're able to visit other cities then I'd recommend you head to Busan for the Korea's best baseball experience with the Lotte Giants.7/10 experience at the game.0/10 for the ticket reservation system."
7,5.0,This was my first experience with baseball outside of the US and I was blown away with how loud the crowd was.I had a blast and I can’t wait to catch another game.
8,5.0,"If you like baseball, this is a fun evening out, shoulder to shoulder with LG Twins fans. Beer and food is cheap (not like US stadium inflated prices), and there's energy in the air with cheers led by a cheerleader squad for the players at bat. The fans are friendly and enthusiastic, it's a lot of fun!Buying tickets online is next to impossible for a non-Korean, so don't try, Rather, go to the stadium and queue at the ticket window, The green outfield seats are cheap and perfectly fine. The red seats down the baselines are also cheap, and put you closer to the cheerleader action. Buy some thundersticks, pick a team to root for, and have a blast!"
9,5.0,"We lucked out in getting amazing seats in outfield section 414 for the LG Twins vs Nexcen game. All for 9,000₩ a piece, we enjoyed the best of the hometown crowd, to include having a huge banner drawn overtop everyone. As English speakers we couldn't follow the words but we got into it, and sang along what it sounded like to us. The Twins didn't disappoint with a grand slam and double homer. They won the game and my heart. I'm now a proud owner of retired #9 Lee Byung-kyu shirt. Am incredible memory of my trip to Seoul."
10,4.0,"Great stadium and great fun watching the communal singing and chanting for each team. Baseball is not major league, but good. Take your own food or buy relatively cheaply in the ground. Was just a fun few hours."
11,5.0,It's so lively and fun throughout the game. Tickets can be purchased few hours before the game it is super easy even for foreigners or if you can't read hangul you can get by just pointing out your desirable seat.
12,5.0,"I went to watch the baseball match between the LG Twins and NC Dinos. The atmosphere was amazing! There cheerleaders and each baseball player had their own specific cheering song. I also tried the famous chimaek aka korean fried chicken and beer combi there and it was very delicious. The stadium is outdoors and the weather was great as I went during spring. Would definitely recommend everyone to watch a baseball game there! Also, you can buy the tickets on the spot and it is not expensive, about 12,000 KRW for a relatively good seat."
13,5.0,"The outside vendors are great, the convenience stores are plentiful, and the games are fun. Going to Jamsil is one of my favorite things to do in Seoul."
14,4.0,"I don't particularly like baseball,  but the atmosphere at these games is infectious. The crowd chant continously, cheer leaders dance, people drink beer and the fried chicken is everywhere. Good priced tickets and this is one of the biggest stadiums in Seoul.  Only downside is that it's not that central location in Seoul and pre booking  doesn't have a good English service. However you can often get cheaper seats if  you get there early enough.  But still try to arrive at least an hour  before the game starts on the day to ensure tickets. The game of baseball wasn't great but the memories and fun with the crowd was amazing."
15,5.0,Went to watch to the Doosan Bears and LG Twins. Really nice ball park. Very fun crowd and they have guys that have backpack draft beer!  Great atmosphere and easy to buy tickets. If you want baseball in Korea this is a must
16,5.0,"Highlight of the trip for sure.  We were told by our concierge that since baseball is South Koreas favorite sport games sell out a week in advance and we would have to buy tickets from someone outside (we never saw this).  I did some research and in order to purchase in advance online you need a Korean ID number, so we had no choice but to take our chances at the game.  We took the metro and it was super easy, with the Sports Complex stop right outside the stadium.  We arrived about 30min early and there was a huge crowd as expected, and people selling a large variety of food outdoors.  I was a little perplexed by this as many people were buying food- I learned later that you can bring in outside food and go in and out with your ticket.  We found the ticket office and there were long lines, but they moved fast.  We bought outfield tickets (~$8USD) which we learned were first come first serve, so all the seats were either being held (people buying food outdoors) or occupied.  If you sit in this section come early as we had to stand, with many others, until seats came available in the 6th inning...  The atmosphere was amazing!  When your team is at bat the crowd sings different songs, you get a show within a show!  There is no announcer, which I thought was strange and the pitching was not great, but we enjoyed ourselves tremendously. I would highly recommend this, GO BEARS!!"
17,5.0,I had the opportunity to watch a baseball game at the stadium. And what an experience it was. They have cheerleaders and cheers for their respective teams. The beer at the ballpark is very inexpensive. 1 L of beer is $3.50 or 3500 Won. If you're too lazy to go find food they have an app where someone will deliver the food to your seat.
18,5.0,"Korean baseball is something to behold - the crowds sing non-stop through the entire game (over 3 hours) led by the cheerleading team.Unlike US baseball, the Korean crowds are so passionate and noisy - my ears were ringing by the end of the game. They are also so friendly - even helping with a few words to the myriad of songs.Broader entertainment is also fun including the focus on a couple on the crowd to kiss as well as prizes for best dancers and a competition for who can down a beer quickest - through a straw...Can't wait to go on my next visit. Best seats are with whoever is the home team (Doosan or LG) and sit in the tier just above the cheerleaders (see photos).  This is usually around 1st base."
19,5.0,"Decided to catch a baseball match in Seoul. It was totally awesome...the match, the crowd, the cheerleaders! We just sing along and cheer for the team and members we are supporting.There were prizes given out as well. The 3.5 hours was truly amazing and an experience. Definitely going for more matches if I happen to be there when there is a match.How to buy the ticket: This was the most challenging part as I tried to search high and low only to realize that only local are able to book the ticket online. The ticket booth will open 2 hours before the match so be there slightly early to grab the tickets. You need to choose the team you want to support before getting the ticket so that you will know which side you will be sitting. You will be able to see the game clearly if you are seated at the VIP zone or table zone. If you wanted to see both the game and cheerleaders, then blue zone will be good. If you wants to be nearer to the cheerleader, choose the red zone."
20,5.0,"Tickets are cheap, food is interesting, and the show the fans put on is entertaining. Throw in the fact that you can BYOB, and you've got a great way to spend an evening for any budget. Stadium is clean, convenient to reach, and staffed with friendly faces. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul."
21,5.0,"If you have a chance during the season (check their schedule online), baseball games are so much fun in Korea !  The crowd is singing, chanting and cheering throughout the whole game. It's difficult to describe, but I rarely go to baseball games locally here, but have been to 4 games in Jamsil Stadium in Seoul.Tickets range from 8,000 to about 65,000 KRW (approx $8 - $65). Were were in the outfield bleachers on this trip. $ 8 ticket, and $3.50 for a 1 L beer. SO MUCH FUN !"
22,5.0,"great experience, was my first baseball game,you can buy tkts via web or in the stadium but than  you will have to wait in line a lot!there is 2 local times in seoul the twin and the bears.the game is long but its nice to see all the cheering of the fans.bring your hat its quiet sunny and hot, in the Stadium you can find fast food and snacks, and sport souvenirs shops.there is metro station close to the Stadium"
23,5.0,"Easy to find and get to, cheap tickets available the day of the game, an abundance of fried chicken both outside and inside the stadium, reasonably priced everything, and simply a lot of fun!Korean baseball is far more intense than the laid back American games. With cheerleaders and hype men, songs and fanfare, it is really an amazing experience."
24,4.0,"Even though the Doosan Bears had lost, it was still an interesting experience, tickets were as expensive as roughly 30.00$ CAD (33,000 Won) and as cheap as roughly 10,000 Won.The stadium can be pretty empty at times and pretty accessible for seat hoppers. The exciting part of the stadium was on the right side, yes, in front of the cheerleaders and hype guy stand. There were numerous opportunities to get food, beer and merchandise at decent prices, smoking is prohibited but I guess security can tell that to the large groups of people smoking along the outer wall. The tickets can be purchased with visa at the gate, you cannot order the tickets online unless you are a Korean passport carrier.You should be able to work a deal out with your hostel manager or hotel to throw some decent tickets together at a nice price, the tables in the 30,000 price range are great fun.The subway is right at the entrance of the stadium in front of the merchandise store (you can buy cheaper merchandise from the smaller shops independently owned in the Subway)."
25,5.0,"If you're in Seoul, try to make it to a baseball game! They are nothing like north american baseball games - its always packed, high energy dancing and fans, as well as you can bring your own food/drinks or buy giant $3 bottles of beer and fried chicken to enjoy! It's a great time - one of the highlights of our trip!"
26,4.0,"Went here to watch one baseball game and it was an awesome experience to see a real life baseball match. The supporters kept chanting their winning song the entire match endlessly, they even provide each player with their own theme song.Each team has their own group of cheerleaders provided with their own stage and they are the one who made the stadium roars! Of course with the help of the supporters. You can buy a set of fried chicken outside the stadium, consider them as popcorn in Korea. 1 baseball match can take 4 hours so... Sit tight and enjoy the show haha.P.S. Go Doosan Bears"
27,4.0,"nice game ,,, was entertaining,,, would definitely visit again,,,the team i supported won so it was even better,,,,,,"
28,5.0,Went to a Bears game on a Thursday night and the atmosphere throughout the whole game was intense. It only cost us 8000 won each to sit in the outfield. The stadium is right outside the Sports Complex metro station and couldn't be easier to get to. We had so much fun that we might go again before leaving Seoul.
29,5.0,"This was one of the more astounding activities I took part in. I loved the in-game experience, so different than anything in Canada or the US. Tickets were ultra-affordable, and food and beverages can be purchased before-hand and brought in. What more can you ask for?"
30,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of Major League Baseball. However, going to a game in Korea is almost as exciting. The talent level doesn't match MLB but the fans are into every pitch, chant each player's name, chant for a strikeout or a home run, and cheer for their team even if they're down seven runs.The cost is reasonable as well. You can get tickets from ₩8,000-₩15,000. Of course if you really want the high class tickets, you would spend ₩40,000-₩50,000 but those seats aren't really necessary. On top of that, there are pretty cheerleaders to make the game more interesting. You can also get chicken and beer which is the thing to do in Korea. If that doesn't suit your fancy, you can get a burger at Burger King or order a pizza!"
31,4.0,"Baseball is big in Korea and like most local sporting events around the world I love going to see and hear the crowd. The stadium complex is quite impressive too.What you need to know.Tickets are cheap, but spend the money to sit in the crowd. We spent 14,000 each to sit in the red zone, with the cheering and supporters. We got them at the stadium.You can take food and drinks in. Plastic beer bottles up to 1litre are accepted. There are shops selling beer/food outside and inside. It can be cold at night. In April it was about 8c in the stadium which with a breeze made it quite cold so rug up.Defiantly worth doing."
32,5.0,"From 2013-2015, I have been to probably 30+ baseball games at Jamsil to cheer for my beloved Doosan Bears!  Some of my favorite memories in Korea have been at this stadium.  I've made many friends at the stadium and experiencing a baseball game here is like no other place on Earth. Is this the best stadium?  No way.  I would give the stadium itself probably 2 stars.  But it is the overall experience that you will remember.  The fans are the most passionate I've ever seen, constantly cheering, dancing, and celebrating.  I was once at a terrible game where the Bears were down 17-0 in the 9th inning and yet the fans were still cheering as if they had a chance to come back and win.  Unbelievable!  Tickets range from 8,000won (general admission outfield) to 15,000won (infield and cheering sections).  You can get table seats behind home plate, but I don't recommend them since you will be away from all of the excitement in the cheering sections.  The best section to be in or near are 207 and 307 since that is the heart of the cheer section for the home teams.  The stadium is home to both the Doosan Bears and the wretched LG Twins.  Both teams' fans sit on the 1st base side.  Away team fans sit on 3rd base side.If you are coming to Korea for vacation between March and October, I highly recommend you fit in a Korean baseball game.  It is often overlooked on must-do lists for Seoul, but I guarantee you it will be a cherished memory.  For example, my 78 year old mother came to visit for about 12 days and she said the Bears game was the highlight of her trip!  Even if you are not a fan, you will have a blast.  DOOSAN FIGHTING!!!"
33,5.0,"I only spent two weeks in South Korea, but this baseball game changed my life.Previously, I thought baseball was boring. No longer. Featuring tickets so cheap we felt we had to correct the ticket seller we wanted 5 tickets, not 1 (they were actually just that cheap), beer so cheap we had the same debacle as with the tickets (just that cheap again) and dancing by cheerleaders I can only describe as the epitome of high camp, this was one of my favourite things in SK.At times it was easy to forget that sport was actually taking place, but there was. Having absolutely no clue what team was what, about the league structure, or even, frankly, what sport I was even showing up for, I had a great time, and the team we picked entirely at random won 12-3. Thoroughly recommended, and try and get tickets in the ""cheering section""."
34,5.0,"Paid ₩12,000 to watch the LG Twins take on the NC Dinos. Got to the stadium ~1 hr before game time and got seats down the 3rd base line. In Korea, unlike the US, the visiting dugout is on the 3rd base side, so our side was full of NC Dinos fans. The stadium is extremely easy to access from public transit. Sports Complex exit of subway Line 2 drops you off just feet away from the ticket booth. The fans are very enthusiastic, there are cheerleaders, and the beers I had were only ₩3,000. Seeing a game here is a good way to have a night out, even if you aren't that big of a baseball fan."
35,5.0,"For next to nothing (W9,000) watch some quality baseball and experience the weird and wonderful world of Korean baseball. Grab a couple beers, some hot dogs, rice cakes and a ramen and you're away!"
36,4.0,"I go here often to catch games. It's the biggest stadium in seoul but that doesn't actually mean they have the best facilities. Personally I don't like their food and restaurant choices so unless you only want old pizza or fried chicken I would suggest bringing in your own food and drinks!Sometimes it can be a bit confusing figuring out the proper entrance for your ticket, it's not the most organized of stadiums, but if you're a baseball fan and in Seoul during baseball season stop by for a game!"
37,5.0,We were able to catch a free game. There were only a few people watching but it felt as if it was filled to the brim by how enthusiastic they all were. Had chicken while watching the game and bought ourselves coffee too from the stands just outside the main area since it was very cold that day. It was a great experience to watch baseball in Jamsil. Hoping I could watch a full game on my next trip!
38,5.0,"Basically my second home during the baseball season...while it lacks character, the atmosphere can't be beat...by far the best place to watch a ballgame in Korea...there's a home game pretty much everyday except Mondays during baseball season (Apr - Sep) as either Doosan Bears or LG Twins will be hosting a game...unless it's a Saturday or Sunday game vs one of the popular teams (Lotte, KIA, or a Doosan vs LG game), getting a ticket on the day of the game should not be a problem...food inside is fairly priced but options are limited...but you can bring your own stuff in (except hard alcohol)...home team crowd sits on the 1st base side and away team crowd sits on the 3rd base side..."
39,4.0,"If you have never been to a Korean Baseball game, this is a MUST see thing to do.  The Korean baseball experience is a bit different.  There are cheerleaders and the food in the stadium is not too overpriced.  Plus you can bring it whatever you want...beer...a pizza.. they dont care!!!"
40,5.0,It is really near metro station. Very big and beautiful. You can go from it to COEX or Gangnam-guб it takes you about 20 minutes on foot or 5 minutes by bus or metro
41,4.0,"Jamsil stadium is a great place not only to watch a baseball game, but to experience Korean culture and people. Korean cheering is absolutely amazing, with cheerleaders, cheering songs, and very supportive fans. It's also possible to bring your own food (and booze) in the stadium or to buy snacks just outside of eat, so it's also a treat to eat and have a drink there. On the baseball side, Korean baseball is pretty competitive, and the stadium feels over 25,000 fans, so it does have its own ""major league"" atmosphere. The only drawback is that the stadium, which is about 30 year-old, as well as the rest of the Sports Complex, feels a bit run down."
42,5.0,"If you want to see Koreans away from work and school and having fun go watch a baseball game. The baseball is good and the fans are enthusiastic. They even have cheerleaders. The price is very affordable and no matter where you sit you will have a good time. The price of food and drinks to include alcohol is reasonable, prices for food are not jacked up like they are at American sports venues. Great for friends or families."
43,5.0,"Having little knowledge of baseball, but in general enjoying sports we bought tickets for the Seoul-derby, and what an experience this was. Amazing atmosphere, great fans etc. In short, just go there no matter if you like baseball or not.  It'll be awesome"
44,5.0,"Although I'm a huge baseball fan, I think that even my mom (someone who can't stand watching baseball on TV) would love going to a game in Korea. Here are the main reasons why you must go to a game in Korea.#1 The fans are ALWAYS in the game. They have a chant for every player. Even the opponents fans compete with the home team's fans for being the loudest.#2 You need to have chicken with beer. In Korea, the word for beer is ""mekju"". Combine chicken with ""mekju"" and you have ""chi-mek"". It's cultural, not expensive, and satisfying! You can also get Burger King or order pizza at the game.#3 You can watch pretty cheerleaders and one guy with a whistle help lead the cheers. #4 Tickets are much more affordable than in the U.S. You can get a good seat for 10,000 won which is about $10. #5 Easy access to the subway- Just get off at the Sports Complex station and come out of Exit 5.#6 If you go to Jamsil Stadium, you have two teams to pick from. The LG Twins and Doosan Bears share the stadium and play their home games there. When they play each other, the games are even more exciting."
45,4.0,I visited with coworkers and had an awesome experience.  I had a little trouble finding my seat as the ticket was not in English. The conessions were great and the cheer squad kept the crowd motivated.
46,5.0,"We recently attended a match between LG Twins and Nexen Heros, what a night!The crowd is fantastic, the food and drink is cheap and our seats were only 10,000 won each. Getting tickets at the stadium was also easy.Can't wait to return!"
47,4.0,Watching a game in Korea is super fun because of the songs and general atmosphere of the stadium. Food is reasonably priced as is beer and other refreshments.
48,5.0,"This was truly a lot of fun going to a baseball game. You can buy your snacks and drinks outside the stadium and bring them into the game. I would suggest getting all your stuff from a single person outside for better deals on food, beer, etc. and they will sincerely appreciate your business. In terms of tickets pay a little bit more to get on the baselines thats where all the action is. Not to mention the outfield was over capacity."
49,5.0,"What an atmosphere. Koreans definitely take their baseball games in differently from Americans. There was non stop cheering, every fan seemed like a diehard one, and everyone seemed to be having an amazing time. I really can't give the atmosphere justice by describing it here in a review. Look it up on YouTube or see the excitement for yourself. The prices were a bit high, even for Korean standards, and the stadium itself is old and not aesthetically pleasing, but those are very minor problems. I strongly recommend anyone to go regardless on your like or dislike for baseball."
50,5.0,"You really don't have to be into baseball to enjoy this game.  Gather up your friends, pick a team, and enjoy the hype and cheers and cheerleaders... And yes, some baseball, too.  It's a cheap day out, made even more so by the food and drinks that you can buy right at the subway station and bring inside.  As you're unlikely to care whether LG or Samsung wins the game, there's no let-down regardless of the outcome, so it's a win-win day!"
51,5.0,"The home team lost 8-0 but almost everyone stayed and cheered enthusiastically   the whole time! If you have never been to a game in Korea, you will love the cheerleader, the fans and the dancers. Don't miss the opportunity."
52,5.0,If you love baseball you will adore it in Korea.  Admission is very cheap as are the beverages and food ($12 gets you prime seating).Get a seat mid way up along the first base line and you will find yourself in the middle of the home team cheering section.  They cheer throughout the game with dancers and everybody really gets into the chants.  If you favour the visiting team there is a similar group along the third base line.A fun and interesting cultural experience that is safe cheap and family friendly.  There are 3 Seoul based teams so there is a game on most nights in Summer.
53,4.0,"I don't like baseball, but everyone kept telling me that I have to go to a baseball game in Korea. Well they were right. It's nothing like baseball in The States. Koreans are serious about baseball and soccer, and the cheers, music, and chicken are just as important as the game. It's energizing to be in Jamsil Stadium cheering on the teams. I still don't like baseball, but I enjoyed myself there. I even bought a jersey. Go Bears!"
54,4.0,High quality baseball.  Lots of fun.  Not just peanuts and popcorn to eat.  The fans are very active during the game.
55,5.0,Had a great time watching the game. easy trip on the subway. Its an interesting variation on the American version of the game! A must do!
56,5.0,"From ease of access to moderate pricing, Korean Baseball gives you a lot for your Won, and Jamsil Stadium in Seoul is an excellent venue!  Games provide a truely competitive atmosphere that extends from the field well into the stands, as fans for each team populate their respective sides, following the cheer leads, resplendent in their teams' colors.  20K - 30K Won gets you an excellent seat on either baseline, and 10K puts you in the outfield (8K on weekdays!).  There's no gouging for food, either.  You'll pay the same price for fried chicken (or any food...) inside the gates as you will outside, and there's no such thing as the $10 beer / hotdog!  Come for the pagaentry and splendor, and to appreciate the efforts of both teams!  If your trip allows and you are a sports fan, this is a must for your 'to do' list!"
57,5.0,"This is the first time ever that I have watched a baseball match. Surprisingly, the tickets were really cheap. Even though we did not have the prime seats, the view was just as good.The downside was the purchasing of tickets as you need to be a local in order to purchase online. We went through slight difficulties and finally able to secure the tickets with the help of our guest house receptionist.The mood was awesome with cheerleader kept going on and cheering for the batter. If you want to watch a sport, Baseball is definitely the sports to go to. No travel is ever complete without immersing yourself in their culture (and the Koreans love their baseball)"
58,5.0,"The baseball game is really just the background entertainment; it's the overall experience that makes this a must do while in Seoul.  As you exit the subway (Sports Complex - Green line #2 exit 5 or 6) you will be swept up in the energy buzzing around the stadium.  There will be countless street and fast food vendors selling food, beer, and team gear.  Also be sure to pick up a pair of slap sticks as they're all part of the fun inside.  No need to purchase tickets ahead of time.  It's quick and easy to walk up to the window and buy them on the spot for less than 10,000won.  You will also be able to bring in all the food and drinks you want into the stadium.  From pizza to beer, you're allowed to bring it all in or simply buy it inside.  They don't jack the prices up once you're inside the venue.  And then there's the cheering.  From the first pitch to the final out, the cheering never stops.  It's electric, entertaining, and an all-around great experience.   Don't miss it."
59,5.0,This is a great attraction in seoul and I highly recommend going to at least one baseball game while you're spending time in Seoul! The energy in the stadium is like no where else in Seoul! Such a great time and not very expensive! I highly recommend you grab some friends and make a day out of this great activity.
60,5.0,Very well organised park. Excellent atmosphere with cheerleaders and locals going crazy cheering on the Doosan Bears.A must when in Korea. Good fun for a night out.
61,5.0,"This is a must for a summer evening in Seoul. The quality of play is about what you would find in a double or triple A park in the US but the fan experience is far and away better than major league ball in the US. Last night there were at least 20,000 fans in the park when the Bears played the Giants, a slightly off night in attendance. I am sure that everyone of those fans went home hoarse. A little over half the fans were for the home team Bears and almost half for the Giants. Whenever their team was up to bat the fans were crazy loud, constantly. The visiting cheerleaders were especially good. They had that group worked up into a frenzy every inning. It was much better than any MLB game experience. Tim McCarver would have had a heart attack here. Maybe at least then he would show some life.The stadium is EASY to get to. Subway passes are about a dollar. The ballpark is at the Sports Complex stop on the Green line. The cars are CROWDED. The air conditioning works very well and the riders are very polite. Or you can take an orange or white colored cab that is an inexpensive way to go compared to the US. Ticket scalpers are outside the stadium and have good deals. Make sure you look at a diagram of the stadium to get the seats you want. Don't take the outfield bleacher seats. Nobody sits there."
62,4.0,The 1988 olympic baseball stadium as an exhibition sport during that tournament is a great venue to watch baseball. However dont expect to have people run up food or drinks up to you like in the US or in Japan. Very much get it yourself service really.
63,5.0,"I was amazed of how buzzing this place was totally bonkers in the most amazing way, being from the UK we I haven't seen any baseball or understood the rules however I enjoyed every minute of this encounter well worth the visit!"
64,4.0,"I had a great time there.  I was my first Korean baseball game.  The stadium is somewhat dated, but its the fans that make it fun."
65,5.0,If you are in Seoul during the baseball season do not miss the opportunity to take in a game. Vastly different from the North American baseball game. The fans are totally involved and have a different song for each player as they come up to bat. The cheerleading is infectious and you have to follow instructions from the cheerleaders. Everyone so involved I am not sure if they notice what the guys on the playing field are doing. They are there to cheer!!!!!
66,5.0,"Watching baseball is a must in Korea. Jamsil Stadium, home of Nexen Heroes, is the most convenient location for travelers visiting Seoul. Baseball is HUGE in Korea and everyone goes to cheer their favorite team. Actually, even if you do not know a thing about baseball, it will still be an entertaining experience watching flash-mob like cheers, chewing on fried chicken and burgers, and waving your stick balloons at all times. Like everyone mentioned, baseball tickets are cheap at around 10,000 won. Considering that it is a 3~4 hour entertainment, this is an amazing value."
67,5.0,What a great experience to watch Baseball at this stadium. The tickets are cheap (About $8) and once you get inside there is no issues with exorbitant drinks and food prices. Even beer was priced little over the local mart prices and the food vendors had special sets of meals available.The vibe is excellent and I must say that Koreans really know how to cheer on their teams and players!Avoid the bleachers and sit in the main grandstand for a better atmosphere. Anywhere will give you a good view. Very easily accessible from the subway and the facilities are well maintained and clean.
68,5.0,"Cheap seats, cheap food, cheap beer - good times.  Buy inside or bring it in. The fun started on arrival with tons of vendors outside selling food and beer which they put in a disposable cooler bag with some ice for us. Bought tickets on arrival, very helpful attendant at the ticket counter.  We got seats high behind home plate for 10 000 won each , next time I would pick seats down first or third base line as this is where the two teams fans gathered and had cheerleaders out leading songs and dances. The game itself doesn't have the big hits or homers that you get in a north American game but the atmosphere was great and i'd definitely go again. Easy to do with young kids, friends."
69,5.0,"We watched Bears - Giants during a Sunday and it was great! The crowd at the games are fantastic! Singing, dancing and cheering for their team in a way that I did not experience when watching Yankees in NY. In Seoul the supporters spread the joy really well and I found myself singing (as well as I could) to several team songs - in Korean. A really funny experience, and well worth a visit. Of course, baseball is baseball and the games are (in my oppinion) to long, but when you get tired and need a break just head in to the food stores and buy a couple of beers, a burger or why not a pizza to bring to your seat. Make sure to ask for a seat in the home crowd, and if you do not want the ball catching net in your face make sure to sit as high, or as far away, as possible (seen from where the teams are located)."
