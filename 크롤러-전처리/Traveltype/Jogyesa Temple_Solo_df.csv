0,4.0,"I was here in November when they were holding their Chrysanthemum Festival. The place was absolutely covered in flowers of all colours, it was beautiful! The main hall made for a nice contrast to the relative hustle and bustle of the temple grounds. There was a group of ladies making chrysanthemum shaped cake things that were filled with sweet bean paste...delicious. It's close to Anguk station but I walked here after visiting Changdeoksugung.I really enjoyed my visit and will definitely pop by when I'm next in Seoul."
1,5.0,"Jogyesa temple is beautiful temple situated in the middle of Seoul.  A colorful and peaceful temple with beautiful structures, ornaments and greenery to take anyone’s stress away for a little while.  If you are in the area, swing by to enjoy this little piece of serenity.  There is no admission to enter and there are plenty of places to relax and take in the sights.  This is an active temple as well, so it amazing to participate in or just watch a service."
2,5.0,"I wanted to see the golden Buddhas. When I got there, there was a service going on, so I didn't go in. Nice to experience the service. I sat on the benches toward the back fence. The lanterns in the tree and entrance were lovely. I loved all the lotus flowers and architecture too. Definitely glad I made the time to do this!"
3,5.0,"This is a quite unbelievable shrine, as nice as any I have seen in my travels through Japan and Korea. It defies belief that it is not better known  I certainly have never seen anything quite like it.Beautifully lit at night, gorgeous colours. The Golden Buddha statues are just magnificent. Loved the lights in the trees and the heart shaped corridor you enter through.Beautiful smell of insence in the air and the most beautiful atmosphere of serenity. I discovered this place on my second night and will come back each evening now to enjoy its splendour.Quite, quite magnificent  5 stars doesn't seem enough to give."
4,4.0,"Easy to find and get to. The temple was beautiful, some smaller temples were under construction though. The monks were really nice, and there were many people who prayed when i was there.Many tourists were also there and unfortunately did not follow the rules while inside the temple."
5,4.0,Lovely and relaxing place to visit.  Saw a lot of office workers taking a break at the temple grounds and having cold brew and popcicles.  Buddha's birthday has just passed but the colorful lanterns were still hanging.  Interesting gift shop to visit and bough incense sticks.
6,4.0,"Jogyesa Temple is definitely worth a visit if you find yourself in the area. I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit, but then I have seen a lot of temples in Asia in the past. I suggest leaving your shoes at the door and going inside to experience the tranquility and ambience. For Buddhists this would be a must-visit. The three Buddhas are quite stunning. No photography inside is allowed."
7,5.0,I lucked out because we visited this temple just as it was being prepared for Buddha's anniversary and the temple and surroundings were being prepared for ceremonial duty.The interior of the temple is simply stunning with three magnificent Buddhas taking all of one wall and the remaining three walls liberally decorated. It is a working temple and most of the floor is covered in people in prayer and one is required to leave one's shoes outside. Beware of the shoe thief!
8,5.0,It was a first sight in my tour! I wa imressed by the beauty of a view and flowers around. Very splenfud view. Budda is a super hero in South Korea. It is prohibited to make picture inside the temple. The statues of Budda are huge and beautiful. I would recommend this temple to my friends. Must see!
9,5.0,"For someone not in the faith the temple represents, it was a curiosity.  But, if you go, please be mindful that people are actively praying all around you, not just inside/in-front-of the main temple.  It is a colorful and joyful place.  At first, some of the figures in the garden made me feel like a child.  I expected to run into Hello Kitty or somewhere.  I didn't read up in advance about it so I missed appreciating in the moment what it all meant.  Regardless, it is interesting both from a cultural standpoint for a non-believer visitor, and though from another faith, I certainly appreciated that this place is very special to many.  Check it out for sure.  Dress appropriately."
10,4.0,"A nice pagoda near Anguk station. I think you should come there at least once time. The pagoda is smaller than Bongeungsa . From this, you can go to many place around."
11,3.0,This is a large temple and has beautiful Buddhist statues inside but not as nice as many other temples in Korea. It is worth visiting simply because it is so close to other sights in the area (including Korea's first post office next door).
12,5.0,"Very beautiful temple , not far from gyeongbokgung station! Highly recommend it for visiting !!! I love Korean style about mix high tech and old school building in architecture !"
13,3.0,Having been to temples all around Asia I don’t find this special. It’s nothing to write home about and worth skipping if you have other things on your list of must see’s and do’s. It was crowded inside of praying people so I felt a bit that I was disturbing.
14,5.0,Very close to the main shopping and restaurants area of Insadong.  I visited during the spring of 2014 and enjoyed it.  It's also along the way to Cheonggyecheon Stream so perfect to plan all three spots in one day and walk from one to the other.
15,5.0,"Beautiful place to visit just off a busy street.  They had a table set up for foreign visitors to get information.  While I did not participate, they do offer a temple stay program.  Spent a few hours here listening to a service that was going on.  The place is a constant buzz of activity."
16,4.0,"A Buddhist Temple just s stone's throw from a busy street. With lots of greenery and very nicely decorated buildings. Free entrance. Many people praying, taking photos inside the building not allowed."
17,5.0,"Relaxing to visit, the chanting inside.Outside they were handing out free water bottles.Great atmosphere and decor with the lanterns."
18,4.0,"If you're in the Insa-dong area or visiting palaces, please make a stop by the Jogyesa Temple. Its a tranquil location, beautiful to wander in and there are guides/signages for foreign visitors to direct your visit. Of course as a temple / religious venue please dress appropriately (nothing too revealing), even if the locals do not scold you if you do not.It's a good escape from the hustle and bustle of the city but I would say you can also clear the place in 30 minutes or so. The temple stay information center across the road is additionally a great place to learn about Korean Buddhism and can be additional cultural exposure for those who wish to immerse into the religious side of South Korea."
19,3.0,"A lovely little temple, which fully demonstrates the peoples' reverence for Buddha.  It was colourfully draped with lanterns during my visit that invited you to enter.  interesting Icons of worship were around the two courtyards including folk deities.  Unfortunately, there wasn't entry to the drum tower. I only saw one monk during my 45 min visit.  It's close to Insa-dong so it's well worth a visit.  It has an information room for questions and across the road, they organize temple stays."
20,5.0,"The Jogyesa temple is lovely, particularly with all the lanterns in preparation for Buddha’s birthday, but across the road is the templestay cultural program. You can walk in off the street and make a paper lotus lantern or have a tea ceremony with a monk for free! One of my fave Seoul experiences!"
21,3.0,"Its near the palace and tourists attractions you simply can notice by the bright lampion hanging across the street, its temple for budha religious so we need to respect them and not just consider this place as one of place for photogrid. they actually doing prayers and religious activities inside but its free and open for tourists"
22,4.0,Beautfiul buddha temple in SeoulLot of Decorations with lantern was madeMany people come to prayNice experience
23,3.0,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. This was our first stop and it was honestly a bit underwhelming. You are not allowed to take pictures inside the temple as it is a place of worship. It was very cold in the morning and not much to see here. Maybe it would be time better spent during the warmer months."
24,4.0,"This temple is the headquarters of one of the major Buddhist sects in Korea. My experience with temples of this sect is they are highly commercialized. Not my favorite Buddhist sect. But a nice place to visit if you are in the Insadong area or staying in or near Gwanghwamun. There is a great hotel, Sommerset Palace, located just across the alley from the Temple."
25,3.0,"As someone who is by no means an expert in Buddhism, I wasn't too sure what the attraction of this temple was for tourists. Compared to many temples in China and Japan, I did not find it to be anywhere near as impressive or interesting. And compared to many Zen temples in Japan (Kyoto in particular) it did not seem to have a relaxing feel about it. It's very easy to access, so if you're in the area then maybe it's worth a visit, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit."
26,5.0,I visited Jogyesa temple on 6th October 2017. This temple has 3 golden Buddhas seated in the main temple with lots of lanterns on the inside roof. The outside has beautiful flowers growing from the ground. The flowers scenery on the outside of the Jogyesa Temple is very pretty.
27,5.0,"Jogyesa Temple is the center of Korean Buddhism and has a great history behind. Temple’s garden is pretty and colorful, which is decorated in accordance with the season, festival or event."
28,5.0,"After a long, busy, bustling day in Seoul, I happened to arrive at Jogyesa just before 18:00 and the monks soon began to drum and chant in the twilight. The beauty and serenity were quite powerful. It is hard not to notice the juxtaposition of this wonderful spiritual retreat in the heart of a vibrantly active urban location. Very much worth the visit."
29,5.0,Came here to offer my prayers. I find the place really peaceful even though it is in the middle of the city. The decorations are also really pretty.
30,4.0,Jogyesa Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples in Korea and a symbol of Korean Buddhism. It is centrally located near Insadong. It is an important temple because it is the lead temple of the first district of the Jogye Order of Korea Buddhism.The temple dates back to the time of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 14th century. It was located in another location and only came to the present location in the early 20th century and the building was completed in 1938 during the Japanese occupation. It was in 1954 that the temple officially became known as the Jogyesa Temple.Entrance is free. There is a dress code – and visitors are requested to respect the holy temple with appropriate wear.There is a flower garden that is pretty. The temple is beautifully designed.
31,5.0,"This is the central temple of the Jogye sect of Buddhism, the most important sect of the tradition in Korea. The tradition dates back over 1000 years, and connected with prominent places like Haeinsa Temple in the southern part of Korea. Jogyesa is relatively new, but has become important for Buddhism in modern Korea. It has been the site of political protests, and important religious work. Its a small place, so for the tourist looking to take a few pictures, you'll be done soon, but read up a bit on it and you'll appreciate it more, especially considering its central location."
32,5.0,"This is a very unusual temple. It's sandwiched in between a lot of modern building, that has clearly encroached on the temple ground. In October 2017, the grounds had wonderful flowers and floral displays, but I don't know if that's always there. The temple 'decor' is a bit childish, which in itself is quite unique. You can visit two temples inside, but you must remove your shoes and no inside photography is allowed."
33,4.0,Small temple. Much more people. 3 big buddha sculptures. Almost city center. You can go this temple after Gyeongbokgung Palace.
34,4.0,Interesting cultural site nestled in Seoul. Within walking distance of Gyeonbokgung Palace area. Restaurants and vendors galore
35,4.0,Interesting architecture and ambience. Very colorful decoration inside and outside. I found here totally by chance and I am glad that I entered.
36,5.0,I think this was the best part of my Seoul trip. I had the luck of visiting this temple after sunset and everything was beautifully lit and the area breathed serenity. This is a haven of tranquility in Seoul and it is the one place I'm certainly going to (re)visit next time (and I'm not even religious or a Buddhist!).
37,4.0,So be respectful! You can sit down and watch the 3 Buddha's and ppl praying. It's worth a visit for sure. It's a small temple. Free of costs
38,5.0,Beautiful temple with the full range of Buddhist art. It is a little difficult to view the interior which is pretty crowded with worshippers but the courtyard is pleasant too.
39,4.0,"This is a relatively small temple all in all, with a central facility and a small group of outlying buildings.  The main temple is beautiful, and was in full business when I was there, chanting and all.There's a nice entry gate from the main road, and a few shops catering to appropriately Buddhist stuff along there as well.This is a bit different from my experience with temples and shrines in Japan, with the Chinese influence much more pronounced.Worth a visit."
40,4.0,A spacious place located in city center. Very calm and peaceful. Recommend to everyone visits Seoul who wants to have a mindfulness minute or a spiritual experience.
41,5.0,"I went on 5/28 and the lanterns were still up! Jogyesa is close to a lot of other cultural sites(insadong, gwanghwamun,bukchon) and you can fit it all in one trip. A must see if you want a closer look at a Buddhist temple in Seoul😊"
42,4.0,The area is small but a good one to walk around in quietly and meditate while looking at the temple structures around. I came when hundreds of colored lanterns were hung high up creating a colorful ceiling of light. I like stopping by this place when I'm around Insadong as it gives you a moment to gather thoughts and find a little bit of peace.
43,5.0,A very spiritual place to visit. Lovely old buildings to see. A local theatre event was most interesting. I approached from the north.No entrances. Must approach from the south.
44,5.0,We strolled upon this site and was totally amazed.. We actually witnessed people actually praying. It was an amazing sight.
45,5.0,"First of all, I don't know a lot of the Buddhist religion other than the basics but I was intrigued to see the believers in their prayers and meditations today. The area is getting ready for Buddha's birthday on May 3 so the place is decorated so pretty with bright colourful lanterns. I went inside the temple, sat down and watch people pray. The area is stunning with gold and with the statues. This is a easy excursion to come and you really only need 30 mins to look around and go."
46,4.0,I liked this temple a lot. The 3 big Buddhas make and impression and the temple has a strong positive energy inside. I happened to visit at the time of buddhist service which was also powerful. The plaza in front of temple is also a colourful sight. It is just next to Insadong and very easy to reach. So dont miss it if you visit Insadong area!
47,5.0,This was my favourite temple in South Korea (I visited 4). It's near Insadong (between Insadong street 10-12) and I spent 2 hours here because I listened to the monks prayer for an hour. The lanterns everywhere are so beautiful and I bought some souvenirs inside the temple shop (they had nice bracelets). Highly recommend this temple.
48,4.0,"Includes Seoul's largest Buddhist Hall.  In November the grounds which are free to enter were enhanced by a myriad of flower displays and flower sculptures.  Well worth a visit and visitors can sample tmeple life with the Templestay programme tOpposite the temple is an information centre where you can book to do crafts or eat temple food - all for a cost of course,  The centre also has information on the Templestay programme through out South Korea."
49,4.0,"The Admission: FREE admissionThe Temple: This temple is very close to Insa-dong Street. If you are shopping in the neighborhood, come and check out this temple. Love the status filled with flowers. Not only it is a tourist attraction spot but local Buddhists come to this temple as well. They also offer temple life and temple stay program for foreigners. The Location: Subway Line 3, Anguk Station, Exit 6"
50,5.0,It is always nice to visit temples because of the serenity of the place. It is an active temple that offer homestay for foreigners who wants to learn about Buddhism. Please be mindful and respectful and do not make noise or take picture of them while there are prayers in the main temple where the 3 golden statues are.
51,4.0,It's not a very grandiose religious building but it has some beautiful architecture and buddhas to look at.
52,5.0,"it's a small place but so nice and if you are lucky you will be able to assist to a buda mass, or also and it wasn't my case, you will be able to see the golden buda."
53,4.0,"At a bustling area of the city and in ""close proximity"" to some glass high-rises is this temple with fairly small temple grounds which won't take you long at all to walk around (if you even call it ""walking around""), and yes naturally you wouldn't come to a city temple for a ""tranquil environment"".  But being said that, to see here are three nice-sized golden Buddhas inside the temple building (actually ""fairly big"" statues for a temple building of that size), some ""artistic"" flowers & human figures & such carved on windows and in like square frames on upper parts of the building's exterior with also some paintings (that you don't need to look up) and a miniature multi-level pagoda (the ""miniature"" is about 25 or 30 feet tall though) on the temple grounds in front of the temple building; and in like a two-storied tower just to the left of the entrance is a big drum although it's somewhat ""hidden"".Also worth mentioning is that the temple is either in or just a few minutes' walk away from the well-known Insa-dong area with antique shops & such; I walked for about 15 minutes in that area after coming out of the temple (turning right then a left a little later) and passed by many shops but didn't actually go into any of them. Coming by subway, the nearest station just about a 5-minute walk away is Anguk (on Line 3) which is also the station you would take to go to places like Bukchon Hanok Village and Changdeokgung Palace; but what's convenient is to come here after Gyeongbokgung Palace from which it's only like a 10-minute walk to get here (a left turn after coming out of Gwanghwamun Gate followed by a little over a 5-minute walk, then a right turn followed by a few minutes' walk and you'll see the temple on your right).  As for Gyeongbokgung Palace (the biggest of Seoul's five palaces), you can either take Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station right beside the Palace or take Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station just a 5-minute-or-so walk south of the Palace (I recommend Gwanghwamun Station where you'll see coming out of the station the big statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin & king Sejong the Great and you'll get to go through the great Gwanghwamun Gate to enter the Palace which won't be the case if you come out of Gyeongbokgung Station right beside the Palace)."
54,3.0,Walked here today to check out various temples and lovely old tree. Many people in prayer. Also offering incense and flowers. Beautiful main temple with the three Buddhas. Very spiritual experience.
55,3.0,"If you want to explore the temples in Seoul, you can include this in your list. After exploring Insadong, you can also visit this place."
56,5.0,"My Korean teacher's mother took me here. The garden is beautiful. It's full of sculptures, most of them covered with greenery or flowers. There are lots of small potted plants with prayers attached. It's such a wonderful sight.Take off your shoes before entering the temple, take a grey pillow and pray or just sit until your mind quiets down.I wouldn't say it's a unique experience, but if you only visit one Buddhist temple, this is a good one."
57,4.0,This is a Korean Buddhist temple. Many Koreans come here to worship Lord Buddha. Very calm place and it's centrally located so easily accessible.
58,5.0,"This place will take your breath away! We visited recently during a guided tour of several historic sites in Seoul. This was a truly memorable stop. The temple is decorated amazingly intricately and the golden buddha statues inside are truly astounding. There is also a pretty lotus blossom garden, many fountains, a tall stone pagoda, and other interesting features on the grounds of the temple. My husband and I especially enjoyed seeing the strings of colorful paper lanterns of many shapes strung in the trees above the temple. This place is amazing!"
59,5.0,"This temple is easy to find close to the shopping area. Can't mistake this by all the lanterns surrounding the temple.Unlike some temples, you can take photographs of the Buddahs. It is free to visit."
60,4.0,"So, I did not get to spend time at this temple as I stumbled upon it in the evening while I was lost looking for a place to eat.  But, I have to say they had the most beautiful image that I could not capture with my camera sadly.  They have all these multi-colored round lanterns in a huge tree just past the entrance gate.  I was so entranced and tried to take photos that captured what I was seeing but to no avail!"
61,5.0,"This is a very lovely temple dedicated to the worship of the buddha.  Magnificent statues inside, and the entire wooden structure with all its carvings and colour is simply magnificent.  Photography of the temple is permitted.   Must remove foorwear before entering the temple.    A popular spot for locals and tourists seeking time for meditation"
62,3.0,"As an Asian ex-pat, I've seen and visited way too many temples. This one is quite small comparatively speaking. However, I have never seen this many women in one Buddhist temple at one time! The grounds were overflowing with them during a service. That was pretty interesting. Other than that, it's a small and rather non-descript temple, as Buddhist temples go."
63,4.0,"I cannot comment on the temple itself because there was a film crew taping an event at the temple.  While the event was going on, I could walk around the temple and take pictures of the amazing plants at the temple.  That itself was worth a visit.  I will go back there one day and hope to see the temple.  The temple is within walking distance from Gyeongbokgung Palace and Insadong."
64,4.0,The buildings are immense and stark. The empty plazas make you want to watch a Korean soap opera set in the Joseon era to understand more about life when this place was vibrant. Take the English tour to be able to understand the significance of this spirit home.
65,4.0,"Crowded, international, vibrant and intriguing. I think these words pretty much describe the temple. It's a must, if you're in Seoul, especially if you love visiting Buddhist temples. However, it's not your usual serene temple experience. It's beautiful, in it's own, colourful way but just be prepared for the urban setting, sometimes the people and the noise. Probably better to visit early in the mornings. The transportation is convenient, you can easily get there by getting off at Anguk station (line 3) . It's in a walking distance from other (tourist) sites, such as Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchon, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art and many other."
66,4.0,Came in the evening and really enjoyed seeing the colors and hearing the chants. Several people were praying and it was really serene.
67,4.0,"I loved the three big buddhas, really all the temples might look the same but this one was good and the people were very friendly, I had to take photos of them while praying"
68,5.0,This is a marvellous piece of architecture not to be missed if in Seoul. The wooden building is meticulously hand painted with floral and bird patterns on the exterior. There is also some beautifully done religious imagery. The inside contains the prayer area adorned by large Buddha gold statues. Superb.
69,5.0,"Opposite the main entrance to Jogyesa Temple there is a gift shop and Information Center. On the second floor you will find a restaurant intended for visitors to the Temple and also frequented by monks/nuns visiting from distant temples and overseas. It is difficult to visualize a more peaceful indoor location in which to rest and eat after the sensory overload certain from a visit to the Temple directly over the street.The food is all vegetarian, of course, made on the premises and extraordinarily nutritious. The price is right at about 8,000 - 10,000 Won for a main meal plus an assortment of side dishes collected from the buffet. There are no catches associated with visiting the restaurant, no proselytizing, no up-charges for water or in fact anything. Just peace, good food, and a comfortable place to while away before plunging pell-mell into the hurly-burly of Seoul."
70,5.0,This is a Buddhist temple that's located right by one of the best shopping area called Insadong. Stop by after your shopping to rest and meditate as the temple is wonderful.
71,3.0,"Jogyesa is a temple in a Buddhist comlex (small museum, shops, ...) in a street where you can find buddhist souvenirs, callygraphy pens, etc. You are not allowed to take pictures in the Temple, of the three large presiding Buddhas. Many worshippers pray during the day and some monks wander around."
72,3.0,"This gorgeous temple lies in the heart of Seoul tucked away from the busy streets. Although there is nothing particularly special about this temple, it is a lovely temple where you can escape the busy city and listen to monks in prayer."
73,4.0,"Visited early one morning amidst people worshipping on their way  to work. This peaceful, earnest temple represents the impact of Confucious"
74,5.0,At night the monks illuminate the temple with hundreds of bright colored lanterns.If you are lucky you will hear the monks chanting.A fairytale experience among the hustle and bustle of busy Seoul.
75,4.0,"Although the original temple was destroyed in a fire some centuries ago, and the current structure is a replacement, it is still impressive for its architecture, cultural significance and history, plus it was built without a single nail."
76,5.0,"You don't need to travel or plan an outing outside of Seoul to see a Temple complex, this is very close other attraction, Gyeongbukgung Palace and Insadong. Friendly and open you can wander the grounds, go into the temple area, no shoes and visit the gift shop."
77,5.0,This temple is just so beautiful! I've been to many buddhist temples and this place is one of the awesome I've seen. Around cherry blossom season there's a lantern festival and the area outside the temple is decorated in beautiful and colorful lanterns. An overall awesome place!!!!
78,5.0,Wonderful Buddhist temple set in a pretty garden with spectacular flower beds. There is an English speaking information booth if you want to find out more of the history. I was happy just wandering around and observing the peaceful and picturesque surroundings. Also the Shihan Bank ATM nearby is one of the few in downtown Seoul that accepts most international cards.
79,5.0,They are having this beautiful chrysanthemum festival now with all kinds of sculptures covered in these flowers. Each pot of flowers was bought through a donation by individuals or families. In the temple area was a store selling some nice Buddhist paraphernalia.
80,4.0,"To study Buddhism, you can stay overnight here.some time it has special event like a lantern festival and flower festival. Please check the date with Korean tourism organization because the lantern festival like this review is up to lunar calendar."
81,5.0,Found this by accident and didn't realise I was so close to it.  Very pretty and peaceful place.  Especially nice when they ring the bell (end of the day in my case).  Came back one night while prayers were going and quite serene.
82,4.0,"When in Seoul make sure you visit the Jogyesa Temple, the oldest one in town and worth a visit...note that not much English is spoken here, so you are on your own however you can hang around the Temple, visit all you like and most of all make sure you visit the 3 large Buddhas inside the main hall.If you visit around midday time a great place to go for your lunch is across the road @ the Templestay building, on the 2nd floor you will find a great buffet Restaurant offering only vegetarian & temple food - it is really great, the cost is KRW8,000 and the buffet is all yours - beautiful, well cooked vegetarian food that is not easy to find in Seoul (and trust me, which I'm not even a vegetarian!)  The name of the place is Jogyesa Temple Foods Samso Restaurant, address is 71 Gyeonji-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul 110-170 - try it!"
83,5.0,"On my first morning in South Korea, I went to Jogyesa Temple. The way I do it when I visit a buddhist temple in Thailand, Laos or Cambodia, I got there, took off my shoes and entered. And only then realised that there where plenty of people inside the temple, praying. Maybe if I had noticed before, I wouldnt have dared to enter. But as I was already inside, I sat down on own of the mats, and spend about half an hour inside the temple, and loved it. There where about 150 people (mostly older ladies), and I was the only foreigner, but I didnt feel unwelcome. The temple is not very old, and its not especially beautiful, but the atmosphere is great and this is not a museum, its a place where people go to worship."
84,4.0,"Make sure one visits during the specified time as there are some activities for tourists especially with the lotus petals ,  nice harmonious place"
85,4.0,"A nice peaceful place, you can see the beautiful gold Buddha statues with in the temple. My highlight was seeing the vast amount of colourful prayer lanterns tha was hanging up outside."
86,4.0,Very peaceful temple a few blocks from Anguk station and the main Insadong street.If you can go during a festival it's quite beautiful. Take photos and admire the scenery but understand that this is a religious place so be mindful when people are in servicesIf you can go during a weekday it'll be much less crowded and you'll have a more peaceful time.
87,5.0,"You can see lotus in pots rather than in the more traditional lotus pond but don't worry there are fish floating above the flowers which more than makes up for the lack of a reflecting pool. Actually there is a small pool with water lilies that is quite nice. The temple was big and very active with a service going on inside. I could hear the chanting by both priest and congregation. It was a time for me to stay outside. I loved the architecture, very reminiscent of Chinese temples and buildings with no doubt Korean characteristics that would be clear to the trained observer. And there was this gorgeous overhead river with salmon that was absolutely delightful."
88,5.0,"I stumbled upon this religious site my first day in Seoul. It was quite a pleasant walk from the Centermark Hotel. The Buddha statues are enormous. I always feel shy to take photos of religious sites, because I don't want to be offensive but nobody seemed to mind. If you go feel free to leave a little something for donations when you walk up from the street."
89,5.0,"A working or should I say an area of worship for many locals. The buildings and the 3 buddhas were golden and impressive, but you need to be respectful to the people worshiping there. However it does seem a little strange when you realise that all these modern sky scrapers surround it."
90,4.0,My host took me here for a quick stop.  She is Buddhist so she told me a little about it.  We sat in for a little bit just so I can get a sense of their practice.  It was very nice.  It's a very beautiful temple as well.
91,3.0,"I'm very surprised by the glowing reviews that I see for this attraction. I went here on my last day in Seoul, and was surprised by how small the temple was. The temple merely consists of a gate, a small drum tower and one building for the actual temple. The building themselves don't look authentic, and on the actual temple there are modern sliding glass doors! There was a lot of construction going on when I was there which made it even less appealing. The statues of the Buddha are impressive, but the space inside the temple is very tight, so I didn't stay for longer than 5 minutes. All in all, I wasn't very impressed. I wouldn't go out of your way to find this temple like I did; there are much better temples to see in Asia, and I'm sure in Korea as well. Save your time for better attractions!"
92,4.0,This temple is just to the North from Jongak station. It's well worth a visit if you're in the area.
93,3.0,Location closed to Insadong 11 Gil alley; These are small Buddhist temple where 3 golden Bhuddha situated inside.Many local Korean middle age women-men gathered for priest summon on weekday.The ceiling decorated with flower lantern so beutiful inside.
94,4.0,"As a non-Buddhist, I am curious and easily delighted by the Buddhist temples beauty. Again this was the case: this temple looks very harmonic with the trees and the square next to it. I just wished there were more information available in English about it and its history."
95,4.0,"I visited this temple on 29th November 2014 whilst visiting Korea on business.  It is located in the popular tourist shopping area of Insadong.  ""Jogyesa"" is the chief temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, becoming so in 1936.  It thus plays a leading role in the current state of Seon Buddhism in South Korea. The temple was first established in 1395, at the dawn of the Joseon Dynasty; the modern temple was founded in 1910 and initially called ""Hwanggaksa."" The name was changed to ""Taegosa"" during the period of Japanese rule, and then to the present name in 1954.The temple complex consists of a main entrance gate and several buildings along with the main temple building itself.  The buildings are stunningly decorated and the Buddha statues inside the temple are very impressive.  During my visit a service was in full swing which was very interesting and a memorable cultural experience.  No photos are allowed inside the temple and shoes must be removed before entry. I spent about 40 minutes at this temple and enjoyed it very much... Well worth a visit if in Seoul and a great place for some quality travel photography."
96,4.0,"This temple is close by Gyeongbokgung Palace so is not bad to check this out , the real beauty of temple can be 3 Buddha inside the main house and flowers designed in the temple environment ."
97,4.0,"A small buddhist temple in the Insadong area. Because of its location it is always full of tourists. Sometimes the tourists don't pay necessary respect to the people who make their prayer services and annoy them. I saw a woman enter inside one of the prayer rooms, stand behind a praying monk and pose for a photo. Anyway, the red tree in the entrance and the shapes made out of plants in the garden are very interesting."
98,5.0,"Right in the middle of downtown Seoul (jongno-gu) , just blocks and easy walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace, is Joygesa Temple.  Intricate and exquisite architecture.  Visitors are welcome to climb the steps and view the interior of the temple from the doors and windows.  Inside are three golden buddhas and those engaged in prayer.  Taking photos discretely is permitted.  Be sure to look at the colorful, intricate and detailed ceilings.  The carvings are magnificent. Be sure to view the underside of the roof overhangs and look at the exquisitely carved dragons.In front, across the courtyard is a pagoda and shrine where one can walk around (clockwise with your right shoulder toward the shrine) and pause at each compass point, to bow and offer your prayers or intentions.  At the front, you make your final bow and can place a donation in the money slot.   There is an attendant with incense sticks (free) which you can light from the candles and either hold as you walk around the shrine, or place immediately in the incense holder(s).  To the left is another beautiful, smaller building, yet no less ornate,  that houses the temple bell (which is rung during a service at 6pm). - See attached pics.Even though in the middle of the city, and even though worshippers are attired in everyday modern clothing (and electric fans blow in the temple) - one feels transported back in time.  The vibe is one of peace, calmness, centering.  If time doesn't stop it certainly slows down.    The monks are very friendly and approachable.,  One was kind enough to approach us with a kind smile and bless the prayer bead bracelets we had purchased.  Take your time and look at every detail (there are many).  Just think of the hours, months, years, it took not only for these buildings to be built, but for the painstaking, intricate carvings and paintings to be accomplished.  The precision of the work is amazing.This is definitely a must-see location.  Plan to take your time here.    As with all temples, it is open to all, no admission fee."
99,5.0,"If you're not more at peace after sitting outside (while seeing into) this temple with three massive Buddhas at 6:00 p.m., at dusk, listening to the 33 rings of the gong, watching the devout who enter to pray, and listening to the service -- well, just see what it can do."
100,4.0,"its nice, small, simple, and close to the other nice areas to check out such as insa-dong.  not sure why everyone else says its ""peaceful.""  its close to major streets, but def. worth checking it out.  and its free!"
101,4.0,"Nice temple. I didn’t stay for long as I didn’t found much to see here. The place is peaceful. I notice that there is an office at the back that say it offers free tour for the temple, but as I didn’t have much time left for that day I didn’t inquired about the free tour."
102,4.0,"This temple would not compete for size or grandeur but it is right in the middle of town surrounded by modern buildings without losing it's own character as a place of worship. The buildings were very colourfully painted with much details for one to admire.  A short stop would definitely be worth the while just to appreciate the architecture and it was great for photo taking. There are many shops in the neighborhood where one could buy religious attires, arts, prayer beads etc.  If you have the time, remember to go next door to take a look at the first post office in Korea built in 1884."
103,4.0,"The many, colorful lanterns at this temple is a sight to see.  There is a huge, gorgeous tree right in front of the temple that I loved.  Inside the prayer hall stands huge golden Buddha statues but I was sad that you couldn't take pictures at all inside.  I encourage making a donation since for good luck you write your name, birthdate, and address...and then your laminated card is hung above with all the other colorful lanterns.  You get to pick your favorite color lantern.  This costs $30 U.S. dollars which goes toward the temple.  As this temple is right near Insa-dong, I suggest that you visit this place on the same day if time permits."
104,4.0,"I went to this temple and it is very pretty with all the lanterns,.... it is a real sight and should nit be missed! However..... it is a bit a lot a lot and gets a bit too commercial. In the back of the grounds they have for example white lanterns where LED change the colors all the time.... great for a picture but not as it was intended. Also the two carts that drive around to fix the lanterns,... I know they are open 24 hours and you need to add the new ones once,.. but it takes away the specialty!"
105,3.0,"Conveniently located, the temple is great to add on your trip around Insadong. The old Buddhist temple is easy to find and is often decorated. In April/May you may see many colorful lanterns strung up to celebrate the birthday of Buddha. There are two 500 year old trees at the front worth having a look."
106,5.0,"This is a very beautiful temple and I am grateful that the monks allow visitors.It is a place of worship so you must keep that in mind because there will be many worshippers there to say prayers so you must keep that in mind.We were there when they were making preparations for Buddha's birthday so the temple was quite festive. There was a canopy of multicolored lanterns hung in rows above the courtyard, it looked like a blanket, very nice!The architecture is very ornamental and the work of fine craftsmen. This is well worth about an hour of your time."
107,5.0,The temple’s location is what amazes me. The whole temple stands right in the middle of a very busy and urban area that is filled with skyscrapers and corporate buildings all competing for its share of attention and right in the middle of all that stands this beautiful and amazing temple creating such a striking and contrasting image. The temple is done in its traditional form and has three big Buddha statues that captivate you on your entry itself. Apart from that the place is a wealth of information on Buddhism and its influence on the Korean people. The museum around the complex has a lot of interesting information on the same and is worth a visit while you come to this temple.
108,5.0,"Reading the previous reviews, I think I was either lucky or it is fate that I walked past the temple by accident.My travel group were making our way back to our traditional Hanok stay and in search for food after visiting the palace. The docorative flowers attracted our attention. Colourful lanterns and flowers and the soft chanting by monks. Serene. Did not feel like I am in a city at all."
109,3.0,"The temple, while pleasant has little historic value. If you want to see beautiful, ancient Korean Buddhist temples visit Haeinsa, Bulguksa, Beopjusa, or Tongdosa among others. If you are in the area it is worth a short visit, Jogyesa is really in the middle of downtown Seoul. For the highlights of Seoul's historic past visit the palaces, fortresses, and tombs. Because Joseon the last dynasty of Korea was Confucian, not Buddhist, therefore, there are few important Buddhist temples in or around Seoul. To view the great Buddhist temples of Korea you must travel outside the Seoul vicinity."
