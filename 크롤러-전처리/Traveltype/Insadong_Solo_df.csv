1,2.0,"Insadong used to be an artistic/artisnal haven before it became overy homogenized and dull. There is still the occasional good stuff in the back alleys (food mainly), but the main strip is tourist only traps."
2,5.0,"Insa-dong is located in Jongno-gu district. There's a lot of cafes, restaurants, galleries, teahouses and shops along the alleys on each side. You can buy traditional souveneirs here if you want to give something for your loved ones or to remember your trip about Korea."
3,4.0,"A bit disappointed by the area, it’s for tourists and there is nothing genuine.The narrow streets could be nice but again spoiled for groups of tourists."

12,4.0,"The streets and narrow alleyways have art galleries, teahouses, restaurants and cafes, small shops selling arts and crafts and there are lots of souvenirs and lots of people. But if you do wander down the alleyways you can find little places to poke in to. I found a hole in the wall place making only mandu which are the Korean dumplings. Also followed the tracks up to one of the cat cafes. It's just a great time to wander and browse and see where your eyes, ears and nose will take you."
13,5.0,"Lots of boutique and artisan type shops as well as lower end souvenir shops further down the stretch, but the whole area is pretty clean and has a nice calm vibe about it despite being a busy/touristy area. You can stroll down the main street taking in all they have to offer while drinking your fresh strawberry juice and eating whatever you may find among the many options of street food (not for me - i quickly found spice allergy is a bit of an issue in korea!). At the bottom of the road there's loads of old guys at tables outside the edge of the park playing board games and at the top of the road you pretty much have gyeongbokgung palace, a nice contrast. The presence of the traditional korean spa here is reason enough alone to go to insadong, it's a bonus that it's a great area with so much else to offer too."
14,5.0,"A cozy place for a walk, shopping and eating. Not super crowded than the other market, more organize, interesting design of street (you need to explore the places in the aisle - you will be surprise on small and tasty restaurant that serve Korean food and snacks)and lot of choices.Also if you want to have a photo session with hanbok and other traditional dress you can fine one place, very profesional one just on the main street of Insadong market."
15,3.0,I'm finding the more areas I visit in Seoul that they are all basically the same Mind you this has some lovely shady trees down this street which make it pleasant. There is one particular shop where the guys are making a product from honey and malt and filling it with nutty mixture which is delicious.  You can see them making them - nice guys too!
16,5.0,This is the best location for unique and pretty souvenirs. Be sure to also stop Nuri Kitchen for the best lunch box lunch ever!
17,4.0,Very interesting area located in Seoul in the streets that have cultural shops showing  videos on how they made pots. Masks and jewellery. There are also shops selling hand made  paper and all of the materials needed to write in Korean style with special types of brushes and inks which are really very interesting

25,4.0,"It likely goes without saying that Insa-dong is a tourist's paradise--but, oddly enough, not really in a bad way. There are loads of inexpensive, cute souvenirs, but if you look around long enough you'll also find genuine quality goods for not too terribly much. Many of the shops sell the same basic souvenirs--bookmarks, chopsticks, small silky bags--so don't worry about shopping around too much. Antiques, ceramics, and paintings can all be found as well, albeit for a higher price point than the 1000 won postcards!"
26,5.0,"Where to start? So many little shops, tea houses, restaurants to choose from. You can pass half a day there, play in the labyrinth, practice your baseball swing at the batting range, enjoy the free shows on the weekends but don't forget to visit those small streets, so many treasures to be found there."

One particular items that interest me is ""Dojang"", the traditional Korean Stamp which you can custom-made to make your name either in English or in Korean. You should buy this Dojang if you can afford it. obviously the price ranges from cheap to expensive- it depends on materials that you can choose from.Here also you can find small alleyways and there are also lots of restaurants to choose from to fill up that empty stomach after walking along the huge area of insadong.You can use Subway Line 3 (Orange) and alight at Anguk Station and take exit 3."

34,5.0,"If you’re looking for an area that’s chic yet quaint, you’ll love the little alleyways of Insadong just waiting to be discovered. Lots of artisanal cafes and upcoming designer stores here. Food prices are on the high side but i guess  you’re paying for the decor and artsy ambience. There were also some vendors hawking street food  such as rice cakes and croquette. The locals come here in all their vintage finery to take pictures. Even if you’re not feeling flush, it’s worth a walk through just to feast the eyes!"

37,5.0,"Forget the modern malls, this place is shops after shops after shops and it gives you a great walking work out visiting and seeing all that is available."
38,4.0,Insadong is where I was directed by my hotel concierge who already knew me pretty well. It was exactly what I was looking for. The street is not too busy and you can easily cross back and forth. There are shops and street vendors. You can find almost anything from make-up to electronics and furniture. There are plenty of Korean souvenirs from the cheapest to the very expensive. I thought the prices of what I bought was fair although I learned later that most of the prices and shops are geared up for haggling. I’m not a fan of haggling and didn’t bother and am totally satisfied with my purchases. My concierge was kind enough to put the name of the shopping area on the back of a business card in Korean and the flip side had a “please return me to” on it as well so I could hail a cab (very easy) and return to my hotel.
39,4.0,I love many museums near this road more than this road. This road likes every shopping roads in the Korean.
40,5.0,this street has a gazillion vendors selling from korean made knick knacks  to high end silk embroidered tapestries ...also foundlot of art supplies stores.Walked into an amazing store which had rocks from all over the world !!!!!you could easily spend 3 hours here.lots of photographic opportunities .i have found thatbargaining is not tolerated here and prices are fixed unlike in other countries where that would be an option ..lots of food vendors too..don’t forget to try the korean candy floss with nutty filling ..
41,4.0,"Was recommended to visit this area. Lots of souvenir shops also places you can hire traditional Korean clothing and wear for a while. Lovely tea shops with traditional snacks. Shopping good but persistent shop assistants who follow you around the shop,which put me off purchasing anything."
42,5.0,"While touristy, the main street of Insadong is still a great place to shop and explore for souvenirs and trinkets. When I was here, a large group of people were parading around and playing music and were dressed in costumes, not hanbok, and it looked like they were acting out a play. The side streets show a more authentic side of the area which I'd highly recommend you check out too."
43,4.0,"nice place to visit Incheon,seoul and insadong the Korean culture, great temples, scenic country side, clean and beautiful city____________________________________________________jnm"
44,4.0,This is a good place to stop for lunch and dinner. Local food and shops everywhere. Small and narrow alleys which are quite rare to find in this skyscraper city. Absolutely worth a visit.
45,4.0,Very fun place to shop for souvenirs. The place itself is beautiful. Lots of good restaurants with reasonable prices. You can spend around 4 hours here (including meal).
46,5.0,There are plenty of souvenir shops around. Not as cheap as Dongdaemun market but still good. The shopkeepers are friendly and some can speak English. The little alleys have hidden restaurants and very cheap accommodation if you are backpacking.
47,4.0,"Nice place for a tourist to visit. You can find lots of traditional tea houses, gift shops etc. However, it can be a little too touristy."
48,4.0,"if you dont want to eat only korean food, this is the place to go.they have a wide range of cuisines here."
49,3.0,Too many shopping places. Korea is trying hard to get money out of tourists. Some decent food places in the area.
50,5.0,"To get there, take a stop at the same station where you're stopping for Changdeokgung and Bukchon Hanok village. Direction will lead you to some stair ways to proper exit towards Insadong. Walk straight for around 100 meter and once you see a bag store, turn left. Shops and hawkers are lining up on street on both left and right side - most are selling Korean style souvenir- so no need to be worried if what you are looking for is not sold at one store. You can move on to the next one and will find exactly the same stuff but with cheaper price! It is best not to skip hawker's stalls for some unique and tasty snacks, but my recommendation goes for kkul tarae (sweet dragon moustaches as it is said). The last time I bought it, kkul tarae costs you 5000 won and above - price worth for its taste and experience the maker offered."
51,1.0,"As a native that was born and raised in seoul half of my life, I do not recommend this Insadong for buying souvenirs nor the authentic Korean experience. Although designated as a touristic, traditional artistic mecca where one can buy traditional crafts, dont be fooled by the seemingly peaceful vibe with people dressed in modified traditional attire. Many years ago it was a street where many artists would gather and share their art on the street or openly perform, but nowadays the majority of shops carry factory made items and are extremely hostile towards any new artists.Everything from mediocre tea to food is overpriced and I have seen people trying to sell extremely ornate and intricate handicrafts get disrespected and mistreated by these shopwners for the mere fact that they wanted to showcase their art on the street recently. For authentic souvenir shopping I would much rather recommend Hongdae or Namdaemun or other districts where you can meet and buy directly from traditional artisans rather than buying from here. I am leaving this review because I have been extremely disappointed with what I have been seeing the recent years and would not recommend any of my friends to pay for overpriced souvenirs and food."
52,4.0,"The Main Street has numerous shops, especially antique or imitation antique of Korean tea sets and vase, etc. one could also look for items relating to Buddhism here as there is a street that exclusively sells these items. This is also the area where one can have delicious traditional Korean food, especially temple foods and foods from ancient times. There are several hidden tea shops that are gems. This is a fun area to walk around and suitable for families with young children as well."
53,4.0,"Had lunch here, Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing photo shoot), a little shopping. It’s worth an hour or two if you are in the area."
54,5.0,"I enjoyed walking through this area with its numerous shops, galleries, and restaurants.  The Poop Cafe is also located in this area.  Insadong is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
55,4.0,"Full of people, shops and small restaurants. Good place to collect souvenirs, though the choice is not very wide."
56,5.0,"Not as crowded as Myeongdong Shopping Street.  There are so many artistic stuffs being sold, eg: ceramics, calligraphy, mask and so on. You can also find keychain or other souvenirs, you can easily find those things in this place. But if you want to find the best price for the souvenirs, better for you to shop at Namdaemun market.There will be some food street seller in the evening.  You can also visit Ssamziegil, unique building with many artistic things, you can shop and join workshop there. Insadong has different specialty compared to Myeongdong. Myeongdong provide many cosmetics store but Insadong provide many artistics stuffs. Visit both of them if you visit Seoul."
57,5.0,"Though a bit touristy, this street has a lot of charm and fun little handmade goods and art everywhere you look. Definitely has a different vibe than many of the other areas in Seoul."
58,4.0,"I liked this place because there are some street food, souvenir shops and restaurants. I think is one of the places you need to visit been in Seoul."
59,4.0,"It feels like old and new blended into 1 place. Insadong, offers an unique blend of modern, arts and crafts shops. Can be crowded but that is the charm of it. Try the food, I like the dragon beard candy."
60,3.0,"A long street of arty type shops selling independent made jewellery, and other arty stuff for tourists. Seems to be mostly independent run shops. A few cafes and eating places along the street"
61,4.0,"Shopping is not my thing, however, there were a few things here that caught my eye.  The pretty street is a bit of a tourist trap though.  There were abundant hanbok shops, 'antique' shops, and many craft shops such as embroidery, adorned boxes, pottery, souvenirs, and the ilk. It did have several nice looking art galleries, which I didn't visit due to time limitations, and in one side street a Knives and Sword shop.  I did, however, head off the main shopping street to explore the small side streets, which I believe is called Ssamzigil.  These alleys had some amazing and beautiful architecture, some of which were cafes and restaurants.The shopping area didn't open until 10 am and some shops 10.30-11.00am. I went on a weekday.  Worth a visit."
62,5.0,Insadong is a must-visit place whenever I stay in Seoul. You can find all kinds of souvenirs from the cheap mass produced items to the unique handcrafted ones. Not to mention the wonderful restaurants along the small side-streets of Insadong.
63,4.0,"One thing I like about this place is that it's near the palaces and it's not so crowded plus, it has a public toilet hehehe Street food is a bit cheaper in Myeongdong as well and uf you want to buy some souvenir, this is the place to be."

66,5.0,"It's fun to walk around this huge shopping street/ area for all different type of ""Artsy"" hand crafted souvenirs to bring home. If hungry, turn into one of the alley ways. There you will find tons of restaurants."
67,4.0,Lot of souvenir shops around herePrice is expensiveMade in Korea productsPopular with tourists for shopping
68,4.0,"Be sure to check it out. Probably one of the more pricey shopping areas, but this is one of the most popular areas for street shopping to visit. I bought a color caricature for $18, probably could have found someone to do it for a bit less outside of Insadong, but the artist was nice and she did a great job."
69,4.0,This place is artistic and can feel the Korean cultural. There are lots of traditional gift shops if you want to buy gifts for your friends and families and also you can rent a Hanbok and wear 😊
70,4.0,"I last visited Insadong in 1993. Wow - wow again!!! How much it has changed. Arty and vibrant with a great selection of art shops, eateries and and art essentials. Browsed through so many shops and studios.Difficult to say which is my favourite, but I think it must be the collection of Kwak Bong Soo in his gallery. Met the artist himself - didn't speak much English but awe inspiring art. Found a fantastic restaurant - basic and simple where I enjoyed Kimchi chegae and bibimbap. Spend a few hours idling around. Even found a ship selling African art. Be inspired - so much around you, I found some plastic photo backdrop material - just 3000 won each - a sure bargain.This street has an eclectic mix, vibrant as art is and an appeal to such a wide audience. Come stroll and enjoy. Savour the atmosphere. Great afternoon out."

76,4.0,There are so many cafes and cool crafts located in Insadong area. It's totally different from Myengdong which full of cosmetic shops. Worth to look around for cool souvenirs.
77,5.0,"This isn't the traditional market like in some of the villages or other parts of the city, but it is perfect for souvenir shopping as a one-stop. Some of the shops also take credit cards, which you won't really find at other markets around the city."

83,5.0,This is a bit of tourist trap at first.  But actually here's the place for you to appreciate the artsy stuff and traditional items of the country.    You can also enjoy the affordable poop bread and re-enact the WGM scene at Miss Lee cafe.
84,4.0,This is the place to get Korean-related souvenirs with many shops selling all kinds of gifts you can possibly think so. The place comes alive at night. Took a stroll into the small alleys and you may find hidden gems like a charming tea shop that I went into but forgotten the name. You can easily spend hours here just walking to this shop and that.

87,4.0,"Insa-dong Street is about a mile long and runs from Tapgol Park to Anguk. It is a pretty street that has many shops which sell traditional Korean art and craft work like traditional teas and paper (hanji); pottery, traditional costumes and crafts. The area started off as an artists study place – and this is still an area where you can see painters and craftsmen who have set up their shops selling traditional crafts and pottery and paintings. You really get the feel of traditional Korea here. There are regular art festivals held in this area.   It is truly a memorable experience as you walk down this street taking in all the traditions of Korea. Shops in Insa-dong specialize in a wide variety of goods that can only be purchased or appreciated in Korea. The most popular items are Korean ceramics. You need to be able to haggle to get a good bargain. There range in prices is very wide. You can also find antique furniture, souvenirs, calligraphy items, earthenware, and a host of other small collectables. There are also a number of small cafes and restaurants. The good thing is that the street is vehicle free on weekends. There is an Information centre that is open from 9.30am to 6.30pm."

89,3.0,"While there are some interesting things to see in this neighborhood (the temple and the shops selling Buddhist goods), most of it is overpriced items and food aimed at tourists."
90,4.0,"Insadong is one of Seoul’s cultural and artistic neighborhoods.  It is very touristy with lots of tea shops, restaurants, street foods, art galleries, and of course, souvenir shops.  Among the kitschy shops, however, are some very interesting ones that have beautiful handmade crafts and works of art.  It’s a fun afternoon of browsing and the perfect place to find gifts."
91,5.0,"Insadong is simply great. All tourists visit it and maybe that's the reason why it can be a little bit pricey but you can really feel the atmosphere of the old Seoul in here. Insadong has some great tea shops and traditional Korean restaurants.You can buy some great Korean paitings, ceramics, souvenirs, clothes. It's right next to Jongno."

94,3.0,I visited Insa-dong on a day tour. We had our lunch in Insa-dong and the food was absolutely delicious! After lunch we walk for 40 minutes to see the small shops. I recommend lunch in Insa-dong because the food is ultra delicious plus there is also a very popular Ginseng chicken soup shop there!
95,4.0,"Easily accessible, enjoyable street for Seoul visitors. Possible to find many interesting things to buy specific from Korea. Also there are many places to eat, drink, rest. One of must-see places in Seoul."
96,4.0,There is a market here where you can get all your souvenirs. You can find anything here. Try to walk around for a bit because the stores at the main entrance are more expensive than the ones in the market. They ripped me off a couple of times with the prices for some t shirts. I found the same t-shirt in a few other stores way more cheaper.
97,5.0,I stayed here over the weekend on a business trip. It's the perfect location with a lot to do. Make sure to visit the insadong shopping street. There are also tons of restaurants
98,5.0,I stayed in Insadong at the Ibis Hotel.  They were many small alleys and streets in between the major ones which were often much less traveled and full of people than the big streets so it was almost like a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul.  We found many authentic restaurants and some locally owned themed restaurants (some of which I added on Google Maps) which were often likewise less filled and less busy.  It also seems to be a sweet spot in the middle of a great many things that are worth visiting in the area.  Plus I can safely recommend the Ibis as a inexpensive but great place to stay.
99,4.0,"Lots of little shops, cafés, art galleries, independent stores and a nice atmosphere. Start from Jonggak station or from Anguk station if you have been visiting some of the palaces and you want to then eat/ do a bit of souvenirs / gift shopping."

101,3.0,"Nice street to stroll in the afternoon, especially after 2 pm.as the buildings shadow cast on the street make it not too hot and pleasant to walk or have an.afternoon tea there. The street has a good atmosphere but nothing much to shop. Mainly are souvenir stores for tourists. There are a few of good vegetarian restaurants nearby however."
102,4.0,"Great little find if you want to stroll around traditional Korean craft shops, also restaurants, cafes and street vendors so you won't go hungry.Good place to come to if your looking for a that souvenir to take home.I would recommend to download the Kakao Metro app, great little app that tells you exactly which train to catch and when to get off for anywhere you want to go in Korea using the subway system. Also buy a T Money card to travel with, this is a cheaper option to travel on the subway, taxi etc ,and you can use them in some fast food restaurants. Just load them with credit at any 7 eleven or charging points in the subways."
103,5.0,"Insa-dong Street , located in the heart of the city is one of the most memorable attractions in Seoul and represents the focal point of Korean traditional culture and crafts. Stores in Insa-dong specialize in a wide variety of goods: hanbok (traditional clothing), hanji (traditional paper), teas, pottery and folk arts. There are also cafes, restaurants and galleries. Take Line 3 to Anguk Station Exit 6 or Subway Line 1 to Jonggak Station Exit 3."
104,4.0,"Whilst the Insa-dong area is focussed on tourists it has many great little shops, some with the usual touristy items such as t-shirts, fans, pictures etc but there are also many cool little craft shops. Along with the tourist shops many great food places have sprung up. To find some hidden gems explore all the little alleyways and side streets. Well worth a visit here to pick up some souvenirs and take a bite to eat."
105,5.0,This area is worth visiting as it features pretty and artistic shops rather than global brands. There are good places to eat and it is a pleasant area to walk through.
106,3.0,"Another typical shopping district. Some travel magazines said it was somehow artistic and special, but I did not think so or realize anything especially attractive."
107,5.0,"If I had to pick one place to visit in Seoul for food and shopping combo, it would be Insadong. I love this place - there's a nice blend of traditional Korean and more modern style of food, music, shopping goods, and architecture. Explore the side streets for more restaurants/cafe, galleries, and near by Bukchon hanok village."
108,5.0,Many would agree that this is the rafts and cultural hub of this fantastic city. You could spend days here on end and never run out of exciting things to explore. If you like crafts and tradition then this is the place. Don't feel shy to haggle for a good bargain. I got myself a jade turtle and a bronze tiger sculpture at a bargain. There are also some nice restaurants here and there us also the Jogyesa tremble nearby. Love this place.
109,4.0,"Lovely place to wander around and get lost amongst the little lanes branching off the Main Street.This is the craft / cultural centre of Seoul so lots of little shops selling handicraft, pottery, souvenirs, etc.  plenty of quaint cafes and restaurants too to satisfy your hunger. I really enjoyed the few hours I spent exploring the area.. But did not buy much as things seem rather overpriced due to its popularity with tourists."
110,3.0,"It's pretty near the main palace and the folk museum. I went there for a tour of insadong and then went to the temple, palace, and museum. Wouldn't go just for it."
111,5.0,It's a lovely street to walk on...eat food....visit tea house....shopping....I went there 2 times and loved it so much.I recomend visiting this street....alone or not....it's a experience you don't want to miss
112,4.0,Terrific shopping street for all those things you really never knew you needed. This is where you can find all the local handicrafts.
113,5.0,I mainly walked on the Main Street and the shops are mostly selling small souvenirs. I think it is good for buying small gifts here. There are a lot of Korean skincare shops in here too.
114,4.0,"It is a really nice place to walk around. You can find different places where they sell typical Korean souvenirs but also some design galleries and stores with really nice items. On the streets close to this area, there are good places to have lunch for a good prica"
115,5.0,There are always some live performances there whether it is a jazz band or some traditional Korean dance...
116,5.0,"I shopped in Insadong three times during my two stays in Seoul.  I loved the selection of handicrafts, and the pottery selection was phenomenal.  Prices were very good as well."
117,5.0,Lots of nice shops for clothes and traditional Korean items. Good prices and easy walking. Food and drink places as well as arts and crafts and antiques.
118,5.0,Great night life and buzzing atmosphere. Go hang out around here for dinner and enjoy walking the streets afterwards
119,5.0,"Insa-dong is a wonderful experience.  The area has the typical tourist items, but on the side streets are many antique shops, galleries, and restaurants tucked away from the main street shops.  A trend in Seoul is to rent traditional clothing for 2 or 4 hours.  Mainly teenagers are doing this.  There are some very nice silver and gold jewelry artisans on the side streets.  At one end of the street is a park with a 15th century, 10 story pagoda incased in glass and steel.  The park is an excellent place to people watch and public restrooms are easily found."
120,4.0,"This is a very interesting area which includes shops (arts/crafts/souvenirs), tea houses, restaurants and everything in between.  English is limited, but overall the vendors compensate that with their kindness. However, you should be prepared to bargain over the sticker prices!"
121,4.0,"Each time I traveled to Seoul, I stayed at Insadong. It is very convenient in location but less busy and noisy than Myeong-dong. Hotels are quite cheap in this area. Easy walking to Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung Palaces and Jongmyo shrine. Good eating places (including Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant) are within walking distances. In addition one could easily walk to Cheonggyecheon (nice waterfall to visit at night)."
122,4.0,"I went to Insadong twice during my 8 days stay in Seoul.The shops along Insadong street carry only signs in Hangul, there is no English sign.Including Starbucks. This is the only or 1 of the very few starbucks in the world which does not carry English sign.I felt so 'Korean' when i was walking along Insadong street.Check out the stalls, some stalls could be selling the same stuff but it's so artistic and so authentic.Must go to Ssamziegil, which is known as the ""Special Insa-dong within Insa-dong."" It's a building which u will never miss when walking along Insadong street. I went to every single stall / shop in the building."
123,4.0,I was in this market a couple of times as it is fairly close to the Buddhist temple and to the palace. It was not busy when I was looking around and it was quite straight forward for navigating purposes. To be honest each shop as the same stuff but the farther you walk down the better prices you get in my opinion.
124,5.0,"This area is close to the north palace - Gyeongbokgong palace. The little streets and shops have an amazing historic feel once you step in. Surrounded by a mix of people wearing jeans and tshirts and the others wearing traditional Hanboks, you'll definitely feel the beauty of the culture."
125,3.0,"Although it's touted as a popular tourist attraction, don't go shopping thinking that you're going to find anything unique. Mostly cheap tourist items. Crowed, and you waste too much time just getting there. Look elsewhere."
126,4.0,"Alight at Anguk stn exit 6. Once exit, u will see shop selling socks, walk straight to the Tourist information centre. Turn left and the whole stretch is food, street performance, shopping! There are two shops selling bags at only 10,000 won! If u are visiting, this is a good place to buy souvenirs home like Korean candies, magnets, wallets, etc."
127,4.0,"Insadong is a very lively area of Seoul. There you will find plenty of people walking along shops, restaurants, ...."
128,5.0,"A shopping street with lots of handicrafts just like what you will find everywhere across Asia. However, this place has a mix of young artists works, traditional art pieces, and also lots of tourist traps.I was here on a rainy day, so it wasn't so fun, but I can imagine this street as a nice place to stroll on a sunny day.Noted that there're a lot of nice restaurant in the small alleys along Insa-dong."
129,3.0,This street is a nice street to walk on and I suggest doing it on Sunday when it's closed off. It is lined with shops that are filled with souvenirs that are craft based. It's a bit tough to tell the junk from the quality but with a careful eye you can see what's good and what's not. There is a great craft mall (not the super touristy one that has all this plastic wrapped stuff in it but the spiral outdoor one whose name is escaping me!) it is worth a browse and you can find lovely little gifts there.
130,5.0,"Whether or not you are likely to make purchases, it is a place to visit in seoul. Here is to find some local craftings for souvenirsAt least just enjoy some coffee or waffles in the cafes widely available."
131,4.0,"A friend of mine used to live in this district years ago; and it does not take much convincing for me to keep going back almost everyday when I was in Seoul. It is simply fun walking around. My only wish/ only missing thing is that it would be nice to have a friend to have a dinner with. I saw so many places I want to try, but didn't feel like it would be fun going in solo. Perhaps, next time!"
132,5.0,Do not miss out on shopping great deals for some souvenirs when you visit Insadong. Shop here for some non typical souvenir items.
133,4.0,"This is a street showcase traditional Korean culture with antique art and book stores, traditional craft shops. It is a leading gallery street. Lost of tourist shopping here. Compare the price because several retailers are selling similar products. Many restaurants and food vendors on the street. You can totally spend hours here."
134,5.0,"I went to Insadong street twice while I was in Korea, once during the day and another one at night. I went in the morning for a quiet shopping trip to get souvenirs. There are places where you can buy chopsticks, vases, tea sets and small crafts made in Korea. People are willing to negotiate with you. There is a gallery with small shops were the artisan is there if you want to get something too. Prices are fair and you can find a lot of options for different budgets. In the top of the gallery is the famous ""poo"" restaurant - where the food is served in bowls that resemble toilets. If  that is something you are interesting in trying that's the place to go.At night there are street vendors selling food and everything smells amazing, I did not try because my husband had dinner plans for us. I much prefer this than Myeongdong street - where you can buy clothes and skin care products.To arrive there, there a few subway stations close, but because I was at the Express Bus Terminal, just got the orange line (3) and get off Anguk station exit 6. You know that you are in the street when you see a big monument of a brush pen - I cannot remember if from the station you turn left or right but it is just a few meters away from the exit."
135,5.0,"My first cup of tea was in S. Korea was at a cafe here. There are bars, coffee shops, traditional item shops, everything you can spend a day shopping or window shopping in my case!"
136,4.0,"Title of my review is meant to be positive yah. Walking around insadong, I see many nice things (e.g. clothes, food, souvenirs, etc), I smell a lot of good food. Even in the cold, it's nice to just walk around. Maybe you can get some nice souvenirs or clothing ;)"
137,5.0,"Here got something special and traditional souveniers near to the ssamziegil plaza, sometimes you got lucky got tv show for cultural events happen there, i went there and got to see the cultural performance there."
138,4.0,A very good place to walk around for the night if you're new to Seoul. There are some interesting shops and some good traditional soju watering holes.
139,4.0,Love Insadong because of its mix of old and new and there were a lot of interesting things to do: dressed up in Korean clothes and having Korean tea and desserts.
140,5.0,Always worth a walk. Cool boutiques and the Osulloc tea house a must visit. Cool eateries in the surrounding as well.
141,3.0,"Some good shopping here, but I still felt that it was all prices and marketed towards tourists. The people are nice so that was good."
142,4.0,"It's always a must to visit Insadong when I visit Seoul. However, it did change from the old days and now it's not as good as it used to be. When I was a kid, I didn't enjoy coming here because I thought it was boring. However, as I got older, I started to enjoy the traditional Korean décor and culture so I started to visit Insadong again. I enjoy checking out the stores and looking at traditional furniture and accessories. Some stuff are not cheap but if there's something you like, splurge on it! I bought a traditional wooden clock back in 2004 but still works and we always get compliments by guests. I am disappointed that Insadong opened cosmetic stores there because it looks out of place and a lot of the traditional shops are closing down. People should not come here to shop for cosmetics! :( I can't wait to go back so I can make a new stamp for myself. I often get a handmade name stamp when I visit because it's one a kind and you can personalize it. Insadong is a great place to see the more traditional side of Seoul so make sure you visit one of the many tea shops for some afternoon tea. :D"
143,5.0,"Very good for shopping traditional Korean artefacts, apparels and food. Insadong should be your first destination for shopping before you visit the high streets"
144,4.0,Life starts only after 4pm!  Some shops open as early as 9am. But the street carts starts from 3:30pm onwards! A great place to visit and shop! Lots of arts related crafts pieces!
145,4.0,"A really touristic place, basically for shopping since it has a lot of souvenir stores, of course prices are a little bit higher than other areas but if you wanna just try a little of everything at once is fine"
146,5.0,A little traditional oasis in Seoul. There's a lovely man at a table/stall just as you head out of the subway who paints fans and banners- his work is incredible and affordable. Grab some tea and take a tonne of photos.
147,5.0,"Enjoyed a good walk at Insadong if you have time in Seoul.  You can enjoy shopping the Korean arts/handicrafts/souvenirs items or traditional pens (for calligraphy), paintings, ...etc. or visit the Ssamziegil building where you can find interesting shops inside, artists drawing."
148,5.0,I haven't been there this trip or recently but it gives real old Korea feeling that I always appreciate.... I appreciate more since I'm not in the country maybe.Sam-Chun-dong near KyoungBok Palace also gives the upper social decent feelings there. I haven't been there recently.I wonder if any nouveau scenes are there but has strange old feelings there.
149,3.0,this place has a ton of shopping and eating stalls.  fun to explore and people watch  even though it is crowded it is fun
150,5.0,Nice pedestrian street. Full of artisanal craftworks and souvenirs.Try to find hidden tea houses on the small side streets.
151,3.0,"There is one street here where there are a lot of souvenir shops. There are other shops as well like clothes, accessories, eateries and etc. There are many art galleries too. Visitors can have a taste of local culture here and buy souvenirs before going home. However, the souvenirs are pretty much the same in every shop. If you are pressed for time, just go to one or two shops is sufficient."
152,5.0,I came here around 4pm and spent time to visit interesting shops that sell all sort of things. You may stop by restaurants which offer plenty of good food.  Stayed till 8pm and able to buy lots of souvenirs with reasonable price.  Great stop in Seoul.  Highly recommend for visitors!
153,4.0,Different! Many alleys and traditional buildings. I had a tour guide and without her I would have gotten very lost. The area is amazing and a true experience of Korea
154,4.0,Cultural and food street. Short walk up and down if not stopping for any sit down meal. Shoppings and bakery stores can be found
155,4.0,"This is a great place to browse and take pictures of local food - great varieties of dried fish, the sweets made from rice (called cakes in Korea) are an excellent snack - sort of like a moist energy bar. There are several coffee shops and great small stuff to take home for presents. I bought very good quality bits for my grand-children at a very reasonable price. All sorts of brand name goods, sun glasses etc. of course be careful of knock-offs."
156,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places in Seoul. It is accessible from the train station and close to the other tourist spots. I prefer buying souvenirs here, a lot of options and bit cheaper. Also this is a good place for food tripping."
157,5.0,"this is probably the place I like the most in Seoul. Every corner of the street is just lovely in its own way. A lot of souvenirs shops on the street, with reasonable price. Ssamgiziel is also worth to drop by for 1hour. When you're tired of shopping , the street food is all around. Try the chicken bbq ^^. Some nice guys sell the candy (don't remember the name) -- it is the King's candy as they said. They will perform how to make a candy right in front of your eyes ^^, very interesting. so after watching their show, no one could leave without buying one box :)"
158,4.0,"Insadong is great just to walk around in, even if you don't want to shop.  The street itself is cobblestone and the surrounding area feels very local, but accessible to tourists."
159,4.0,"This street is a car prohibited area, so you can shop by walking freely. Many souvenir shops here and artsy things, street food is available here also. Walk through the many alleys and you can find authentic korean food in many restaurants available there. Make sure you come in the Ssamzigil department store where you can find many unique shops selling interesting products made in Korea. Recommended to visit while in Seoul."
160,4.0,"A bit more modern than Namdaemun shopping center but has a large variety of shops, and more importantly for me,  a large selection of eateries and take away shops.Worth a visit if you love shopping,  but i place this under Namdaemun and Dongdaemun because those places have more of the traditional market vibe i like"
161,4.0,"This is the place where you can lunch for traditional Korean food. After your energy charge, you can visit Insa-dong street to sample traditional Korean culture. Lots of arts and craft shops, tea-houses, antique art and book shops and art galleries. For buying cheap souvenirs as gifts, don't waste too much time hoping from one store to another. The items are mass-produced and prices are the same Of course, you can find expensive and high quality gifts to bring home. After shopping,  there are still interesting sights to visit - the gorgeous Jogyesa Temple and Unhyeong Palace (if you are still not tired of Palace visits). You can stroll down to Tapgol park which is just a ten minutes leisure stroll. The Anguk Metro Station is just not too far away. Along the way, you pass by the traditional gold-smith and jewellery district."
162,5.0,"If you're an artsy person, who's also interested in Korean culture, this is the place for you!You will find many different shops, and yes, some of them are kitschy, but most of them are not.If you're travelling on a budget, you will still be able to find beautiful gifts, as the price range of the shops vary.Hanboks are very expensive, but you can also rent one.There are some tea houses, where you can try traditional Korean tea.There are exhibition places where you can enjoy Korean fine arts for free.It tends to be crowded, but don't let it discourage you. If you're tired, take a break and continue your exploration, there are many amazing things you can get and experience here."
163,5.0,"There is always something going on in Insadong. Maybe a school band or parade. Last Sunday there were many students dressed in native Korean attire, both girls and boys which added to the color of the market as they strolled thru the area.I always come here to buy local crafts and souvenirs. This is the place to find locally made items. One of my favorites is the black lacquer boxes with beautiful mother of pearl decorations on the top and sometimes inside the boxes. I purchased two this trip at the shop which is the most far from the main entrance on the left side. They will bargain with you on a lower price than the marked one.Another item that is a unique gift is a customized stamp with your name in Korean and in your language. It takes about 5 minutes to cut the stamp. It's a great gift item. Kids are fascinated by seeing their name in Korean. These range from $10 U.S. for a small one to hundreds of dollars for very decorative stamps. There are several shops selling them.I love to watch candy made on the premises. These are usually carts next to the street. The makers of the candy entertain the crowd as the candy is made. Great picture opportunities. One of those candy's is called King's Dessert and is made up of 16,000 strings of honey wrapped multiple times with a flavoring of either almond, peanut or chocolate on the inside. You can watch the young men wrap the 16,000 strings.I've been interviewed by high school and college students twice for class projects. Usually they want to know why I came to South Korea and how I liked it. The kids practice their English while doing this, There are many restaurants selling all kinds of food from fast food to fancy food. You can find Korean BBQ where you cook your own meat at a grill on your table. Also many places for tea and I think there is a tea museum.There are several art galleries too. Saturday and Sunday are the best time (and the busiest) time to visit since the street is blocked off from cars."
164,5.0,Very happening international area in Seoul. Had fun walking the back alleys amidst restaurants and bars. Good for lower cost lodging and hostels.
165,5.0,"Everytime I visit Seoul, insadong is the place to buy teaditional cups, and koreansmall souvebir items. Novadays there are more and cheaper places, but I just like the surroundings. And an amazing Temple vegan food restaurant Insarang there"
166,4.0,"Our tour ended at a Insadong.  A place where you can buy cheap souvenir items, ceramic cups.  The souvenir shops carry an assortment of standard Korean utensils, calligraphy materials, figurines, as well as tourist goods. On the main street and in alleys are kiosks selling goods like the traditional Korean clothing and handmade paper.  I also bought 4 pcs Aloe Shower packed at Etude shop. They have a sale as well as other cosmetic shops."
167,4.0,"Several art galleries alongside shops for tourists, cafes and restaursnts make this place ideal for tourists. Tip: don't miss the jogyesa Buddhist temple nearby"
168,5.0,"Lots of shops and eating places, Lots to look at.  It appeared to be clean and safe to wander around in but easy to get lost as I did.  Not to difficult to find yourself again though.  Good place to spend a few hours wandering aimlessly just taking in the sights and sounds."
169,3.0,"It is a nice spot to go to if you feel good wandering with the tourist herd. There are a lot of shops selling souvenirs, but these are much more expensive than in the markets for locals (where you can get basically the same stuff). There are some design and art shops offering quite nice and special things, but the prices were ""special"" as well- I only went window shopping. Insadong is recommended for people looking for antique pieces- yes, there are a few shops selling SOME antique stuff. Most things are fakes (and some of the fakes are incredibly good fakes!). The best indicator for ""real"" antique pieces is a really ridiculous price tag (however, some fakes had the same prices…). For antiques (or something looking like that), I recommend the shops near the Seoul Folk Flea Market, there you find the same fakes and some real antiques for less than the half price."
170,4.0,"I really enjoyed my visit to Insadong.Thre main street is lined with shops selling traditional goods and many restaurants.My advice is, don't just walk down the main street,go into the little alley a fins unique shops and galleries.Street food here is priced cheaper than Meyongdong.Check out the shops selling traditional bronze and brass items, you will find some very interesting things to bring back home.At night, the streets becomes alive with a lots food vendors and bars."
171,5.0,I always love going to insadong area. I love the unique shops and souvenirs. I also ate at one of the back alley restaurants. I had bibimbap. Highly recommend for shopping and souvenirs.
172,4.0,"This is a cute Korean place to visit, but in my opinion, I think it's over hyped. Lots of shopping and great restaurants. But all the trinkets you buy here you can find in other parts of Seoul (Myeongdong, for example) for less. I would consider this cute and commercialized. Is a great place to visit to feel like you are in a cute setting, but buy trinkets and souvenirs elsewhere."
173,3.0,"When you go to Korea, every Korean would tell you to go to Insadong. I still don't understand why except that the place is designed for tourists. There are lots of souvenir shops, expensive stalls, some pretty art galleries and a mall but in general, it is an expensive area. If you want to see Korea, go to the Namdaemun market, not to Insdong."
174,5.0,"it was a perfect Sunday stroll at around lunch time. I started from Tapgol Park just off the Jong-ro 3 Ga bus stop nearby (which is worth visiting if you are coming to Insadong anyways) then walked Insadong-gil(road) towards Buckchon Hanok village. Not too many tourists, loads of cute little shops and the restaurants. Perfect shops for gifts. Definitely recommend to explore little alleyways and find ur little gems. I followed a tiny sparrow that just flew by and found myself in a beautiful traditional vegetarian restaurants alleyway. Public wifi pretty much everywhere so your smart phone maps will save you from getting lost. Tourist information is at the Insadong road if you need someone to ask questions. Definitely recommend to do Insadong and Hanok Village together on the same day. East walk. A perfect Sunday stroll."
175,4.0,"This Market is famous for the Antiques of Korean Dynasty, and Restaurants, it has so many restaurants in tiny by-lanes , this place a must visit for tasting local Delicacies and trust me you will relish the Experience."
176,4.0,"You might still find it in this area. Spend at least an hour browsing the stores, restaurants and little streets.I enjoyed the antique clock and watch store on the main street. They carry a good variety of vintage watches."
177,5.0,First time to Seoul and really enjoyed walking the streets of Insadong. A must for any first time visitor.
178,5.0,"*Pls note I Came here and by coincidence there was a street festival on, hence the 5 stars, otherwise 3.5-4 max *Very artsy area - was packed due to a multicultural street festival on with performances and street stalls. In general its a bit of a tourist trap area and stores selling hipster goods and trinkets. If it wasn't for the street festival, may only need 1.5 hours here."
179,3.0,if you are going to pick up knick knacks to take home - or art work - this is the place.  Items are likely to be overpriced - but you will have fun shopping.
180,5.0,The go-to place for experiencing traditionally Korean culture and there are a lot of tradition restaurants and cafe in the area
181,4.0,"This neighborhood mainly sells the traditional arts and crafts souvenirs. Very peaceful, relaxed pace, and not as crowded as any neighborhood shopping street. I got my own korean seal stamp here! Recommended for those who are into history and arts."
182,4.0,Insadong is a cool nieghbourhood in Seoul with one main street for shopping and dining.  We walked through the main street from Jongmo 3 station on the way to Bukchon Village.  Worth the detour.
183,3.0,"There wasn't really much to do. Many shops sell souvenirs, but more expensive compared to places like Namdaemun market. If you are interested in traditional shops, this street might be something for you. There are many tourists here and also many brand named shops."
184,5.0,"Insadong is a well known artistic district of Seoul where traditional Korean art and culture are represented in small reflections.  Modern artistic expressions and artisans' products are also represented, to a lesser degree.  Visitors can participate in cultural activities and events, buy ""Korean souvenirs"" such as jewelry boxes, neckties, paintings and antiques, and a variety of cultural artifacts.  If you are interested in artistic or cultural aspects of Korea rather than endless drinking that Koreans are known to do, be sure to budget sufficient time to stroll at Insadong!  You should visit not only the streets but entire buildings where artists showcase their expressions; you will always treasure this little reality."
185,5.0,"What a quaint, lovely shopping street. Lots of cafes, restaurants, souvenirs and interesting shops. Easy to access. One of my very favorite places in Seoul."
186,4.0,"Insadong is a great area to explore, take photos, browse for souvenirs or just take a break from the day. There are lots of cozy little restaurants and bars - so much to see and do! Don't miss Insadong on your trip to Seoul."
187,3.0,"Four years back I would have given 5 stars to this place it was the art district of Seoul - great art galleries, great place to buy Korean art with interesting small eating joints. But when I visited the place this time it has been converted a place for Chinese tourist to buy Souvenirs  (which incidentally made in China). It is slowly losing its charm. Sad."
188,4.0,"A great place to buy unique souvenirs antiques and art. Don't forget to drop by the Ssamziegil. It's a four story inside shopping center with small shops selling hand-made products such as jewelry, clothing, and even candles. How to get there: Seoul Metro Line 1, Jonggak Station, Exit 3. Go towards Jogyesa temple and enter the alley next to the 7th Day Sabbath Church. Ssamziegil is ahead on your left."
189,5.0,Very artistic place. You have everything here and restaurants. There is an indoor shopping area and an out shopping area.
190,5.0,"It is a nice place to shop, eat and be happy during summer :)If you enjoy shopping, this will be a nice place, with a blend of old and new style."
191,3.0,"Insa-dong has changed a lot. It was a quiet and cultural quarter some ten years ago, with old shops selling writing brushes, traditional paper, and boutiques artful handmade products. Nowadays, new shopping centre and restaurants opened, it is more lively but too touristy sadly."
192,3.0,This area was too touristy for me....but its busy and full of tourist shops and an easy walk from either of the two big palaces.
193,5.0,Nice cafes and restaurants littered throughout. Found a very quaint rustic authentic teahouse nestled in a corner. Reached a little too late in the evening but otherwise great place to chill.
194,3.0,"Very touristic, lots of souvenirs shops but also lots of place for eating. Ssamsilgil is a must-go if you are in Insadong. O'Sulloc is also a good place for a break."
195,2.0,"When any place is marketed as a street for tourists, everything you see is guaranteed to be overpriced. Do not buy souvenirs here (or haggle haggle haggle) as they will cost you double of what you could pay at other markets like Namdaemun. It's an interesting street for a stroll and close to other attractions such as Bukchon and the palaces, but not a critical place to visit."
196,5.0,Went to the Tourist information centre and then the shopping area. Lots of quaint shops with handicrafts around Insa-dong. Bought some lovely tea cups. Found this more interesting than the other shopping areas.
197,4.0,Go to Insadong to enjoy the traditional Korea. Nice place to shop for souvenir with good price. Street art performance in the evening.
198,4.0,"There are a lot of different shops, for all tastes. Walking along the small pedestrian streets, bordered with small boutiques is a pleasant way to shop and stop for a coffee in kawai coffee shops. Charming area on Sundays, where locals go for a walk too, with romantic couples buying bouquet of flowers."
199,4.0,"I went twice and both times had fun.  First time was on Saturday before noon and freely look around and appreciated the shops and all the amazing things you can find there. I didn't manage to finish so I decided to come back on Sunday afternoon.  It was packed and the atmosphere changed completely. I took a lot of pics of what looks to me like a variety of human-ants and had fun too. But if you don't like crowds, but sure you avoid Sundays ;)"
200,5.0,"Get lost in the side streets or walk the main road, either way you will enjoy your time in Insadong. I went there the first time with a walking tour for dinner and we had some great authentic food then I found myself going back on my own when I had some free time to walk around and by gifts for my family at home.  Very close to the subway which makes it very easy to visit."
201,4.0,"It is a very nice touristic ( in a  positive way..) place...Stroll along ( on the way form the Palace...forgot which one, the main one..) look at the small shops, tea, souvenirs it is all here....WORTH A VISIT !!!"
202,1.0,"Hearing all these wonderful things about Insadong  (인사동), this was one of my absolute go see things. I must say it was really disappointing to see that it wasn't as big area as it had been described as. If you're interested in more art things it wouldn't be a complete waste of time. Otherwise don't bother."
203,4.0,"Plenty of shops, cafe and restaurant.  Pedestrian walk offers a good experience as you pleasantly stroll through the streets. Many tea houses and art pieces. Retail shops selling cosmetic, soveiniers and crafts"
204,4.0,"Been here several times and its a place which you don't get bored. Go there early and you can easily spend a few hours there. There are plenty of shops to buy local souvenirs, from cheap to expensive, lots of variety. Highly recommeded."
205,4.0,Nice little tourist gifts to bring back to friends or family. A few interesting shops to throw into the mix which is nice though. Nice to see it if you are close :)
206,5.0,I go back here all the time. The scale of the place is more suitable for pedestrians and the main pedestrian street is great for walking and seeing. There are nice multilevel cafes and stores.
207,5.0,"If you are looking to get away from the over commercialized area of Myeongdong than head to Insadong. While you'll still find some of the cheap tourist souvenirs you can find more unique, hand crafted items in Insadong. On my last night in Seoul I was wandering the area and spotted a gorgeous, hand painted sign. It was small (about 4""x 12"") and a bargain at 10,000 won. The artist himself was there to show me other similar paintings he had. It was a neat experience and added sentimental value to my purchase."
208,4.0,Vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants along the stretch of the main road and the inner alleys. The locals are friendly but most can barely speak English. The tourist information center by the entrance employs young folks who speak excellent English and can provide maps and other useful resources and information.
209,4.0,"No smoking & littering in this area. Yes, you can search some Korean souvenirs here with comfortable feeling. Almost anything you can find in the shops here, magnets, keychains, pens, postcards, t-shirts and any other handycrafts. Price is average, some people said you may find cheaper in other places but in this area you also can explore other things like visit museums, palace, galleries, and also very close to Bukchon village. How to get here? Take subway to Anguk Station & just near the exit this it... :)"
210,4.0,Insadong is 1 of the famous shopping areas in Seoul full of mouth watering street food and shopping variety - colorful and is full of lights at night
211,4.0,"Located near Gyenonbokchung palace and the US embassy.  This seems like a central location in Seoul.  The market has many souvenir stores for tourists and there seemed to be many english friendly restaurants.  It is 20 minute walk from Seoul Train Station if you want to do that.   Also, from here one can walk to all other major Seoul attractions.  The market is a stop on the Seoul Tour Bus.   I was there on a Saturday evening and the place was busy and bustling."
212,5.0,"Spent a couple of hours wandering up and down the lanes - some shopping lanes, some tea houses, some food lanes. It gave me a real feel for the old part of the city of 24 million people."
213,4.0,Lots of souvenir shops and restaurants in a touristy area of Seoul. Antique shops are also around but not too sure how genuine their wares are.
214,4.0,"Close to my Hotel ""New Kukje"" , I found this a very easy place to navigate to with my local map  and it had a good mixture of shops, both cheaper and upmarket and eateries. ."
215,2.0,"If you in seoul only for a few days or want to get some presents quickly, you are right there. But if you want to get a glimpse of original seoul atmosphere, better go someplace else. I felt almost like it was some kind of tourist trap..."
216,3.0,I was not particularly impressed from Insa-Dong. Just nice to walk around as the main road is in the shadow of nice trees.
217,5.0,"it's a really good place for souvenirs and local stuff, I bought good stuff from there, you will also find a lot of skin care brands a long the way."
218,3.0,"You can find plenty of artsy type of souvenirs here such as tea cups, hanbok bookmarks, brushes, magnets, pencil cases. As for me I bought a musical box with arirang song playing. Cute! However, I do think that they should make this a car-free street all the time, it was stressful to navigate to cross the street while shopping. Has an artsy-hip feel to it, also check out the Ssamzigil space where you can swirl your way up the building and have a photobox picture of you taken with a hanbok. Cute!"
219,4.0,"When you are looking for quality gifts to take home this is a good choice. A long street with nice shops, including eateries you n ed to go to. You surely find some nice presents here!"
220,4.0,Pleasant section of Seoul with old buildings kept intact.  Full of all types of shops and cafes.  One of the few places where I actually found postcards.  Also there is a Cat cafe there.
221,4.0,"Definitely one of the nicest parts of the city. The streets are at a more human scale and the small shops appear to be offering more original handcrafted products. Also, you'll find some pretty good food options in the surrounding area to enjoy!"
222,3.0,"This is the best place to get souvenirs, plenty of choices available. Remember to go into the small alleys for lots of food and drink choices. Shop names there like Starbucks and Etude House are all in hangul so keep a lookout. Visit the Insadong Tourist Information Center to try on the hanbok for free."
223,4.0,"...with lots of artwork, souvenir shops, food stalls, galleries, tea shops. Certainly a nice place to shop (though not the cheapest) and get an idea of what Korea has to offer."
224,5.0,It's  good to walk and good for sightseeing. There are had too many cute things and creative. And too many delicious foods on that street.
225,4.0,"Used to be authentic and nostalgic filled. Sadly, commercialisation has hit I saying and the cultural aspect has been modernised. Good restaurants gone. Don't put it at the top of your must visit places. Only go if time permits."
226,4.0,"It is an artsy street with many galleries (although in my memory there were more when I visited it long ago). A place to find old stuff like traditional artefacts and souvenirs. There were some old tea houses hidden in the tiny alleys for a break fr the noise of tourists thronging through the place. Across the road on the side nearest to Anguk Station, you can continue your walk looking at the old buildings with many cafes. During the weekends, young pple set up their booths to sell their crafts."
227,5.0,"A nice place to visit and do some shopping - you can find lots of things to buy here, from souvenirs to food. Ssamziegil is spirally laid out building where you can walk all the way to the top on a spiral incline (not sure if you get my description haha). You get to see a nice view of Insadong from the top."
228,5.0,"You must visit Insadong! It is a great neighborhood full of artist and tourist shops as well as restaurants. Don't miss the ""poop bread"" located inside Ssamziegil (google it). Also a great place to find local artist collections."
229,4.0,a place to get souvenirs at a cheap price. found unique souvenirs here too. many eateries and cafes in the area. can also walk to bukchon hanok village after exploring here
230,5.0,"This is the neighborhood to visit for classy and artful jewelry, pottery, clothing, art and above average souvenirs. Small streets, engaging hustle and bustle of tourists."
231,4.0,"I stayed in this area and I really enjoyed it.  It is a bit touristy but I liked the many quaint tea shops and cafes and other little gift shops around.  Some of the clothing shops were very expensive.  You can also find cheap touristy trinkets. It was a nice area to sit and have tea.  On the weekend, there were quite a few Koreans dressed in the traditional clothes stopping and posing for pictures with tourists.  In the evening, there was always someone singing in the street, and there were a few food carts selling snacks along the street.  A nice place to spend a few hours."
232,5.0,"A friend and I spent the day just hopping from tea house to tea house, eating little snacks along the way. It couldn't have been a more enjoyable day of delicious tea and exploring."
233,5.0,"It is easy to reach by metro line, exit at Anguk Station and walk about 5 minutes et voila, you have an alley full of unique stalls. There are bag shops with really cheap price, clothes, handmade souvenirs, antiques, and ancient painting tools as well as ancient caligraphy tools. Food stalls are also availbale. They are all availbale at bargainable prices. There is tourist information at the end of the street that provide map. The officer are fluent in english and would happily help us about the tourist information. The centre tourist information provides hangbok to be used for 20 kinutes for 3.000 won which is too pricey. But overall its a must do."
234,3.0,I side with the reviewers that were disappointed with this part of Seoul. It gets a lot of hype in the tour guides but I found it touristy with not a lot of tempting shops. Ok if you have run out of things to do but not worth putting high on your list.
235,4.0,"The tour is reasonable and gives you a sense of prized back alleys, lanes named after horse movement, popular ole local bars and the construction/car free jumble which populates this touristy area"
236,5.0,Insadong is a great place to see.  It is wonderful for shopping and a lovely walking area.  It's a must see in Seoul if you are visiting.  There are a lot of cultural shows here.  Protests often take place at the park across the street from the main entrance as well.  I have been here several times and seemed to learn something new about Korea each time.
237,4.0,If you  truly want to experience the Korean culture you should come to Insadong ~ here you can find many arts and crafts if you're into Pottery goodbye really beautiful artwork and pottery plates and pots. If you want to avoid the crowds the best time to visit this area is early spring or late fall.
238,5.0,"If you are looking for a gift to take home or looking for your friends and family gifts, this is the place. great reasonable shops and restaurants!!! you'll even find some street performers."
239,5.0,"From the moment I arrived at Anguk station,I was mesmerized by some of artwork I found along the way and easily fall in love with this place."
240,4.0,"The street directs you to the Korean modern galleries & tea shops.Haggle more to get the best price :)Cheap backpacks, hats, some Korean style casual dress, chopsticks, place mats, etc..will be found here.I got packages of Korean traditional music instruments & Tae-kwon-do coasters \m/Starbucks and several cafe are along the street, don't worry to get thirsty."
241,5.0,"Very nice antiques and typical Korean souvenirs. I have been there for the second time after last years visit and again like it very much. A touristic place, nonetheless nice!"
242,4.0,"It's my go-to place for a new visitor to the city.  Even with the commercialization done to it, Insadong, is still the place for newcomers to buy souvenirs and see traditional aspects to Seoul.   I recommend the Gyesong mandu place for a more traditional and delicious meal than the tourist traps."
243,4.0,"A recommended place to visit for arts lovers! It's a traditional street where you can find lots of cultural related stuff including tea houses and museums. This place is very popular among the tourists too.For those interested to visit, stop at Anguk station and from Exit 6, go straight for 100m before turning left into Insadong. Ssamzigil shopping mall is also located here."
244,4.0,"A chance to see Seoul in the flesh, stalls, market and plenty of life to see. Shopping inexpensive - worth a visit"
245,5.0,"i really like this area, beautiful historic buildings, full of interesting shops and many great traditional Korean restaurants, must visit if you come to Seoul."
246,4.0,"This area is full of little shops, eateries and galleries showcasing traditional handcraft, Korean costume, souvenir, etc.  You can get unique souvenirs from here. Had lunch in a restaurant on a side street and an afternoon tea set at Osulloc, both fantastic."
247,3.0,"Insadong is supposed to be as a traditional Korean street to find lots of souvenirs, but the street is the same as any other main streets in Seoul. They sell same things and have some unique restaurants, but most of the shops in Insadong are chains, that can be found anywhere in Seoul."
248,5.0,"In Insadong, you will find new trendy shops for young people and traditional shops selling Korean desserts, art and craft and souvenirs in Insadong."
249,5.0,"This is another shopping area if you are looking for some costume jewelry, scarfs and lots of restaurants nearby to this place."
250,4.0,"Go to this area if you're looking for souveniers to bring back home. Although the prices of the souveniers are not as cheap as the ones from Singapore. The keychains and fridge magnets range from 2000-7000 won. You can mostly find artworks, coin purses, chopsticks, cellphone cases, scarves, hand gloves and traditional bags here in the area. This is also walking distance from the Bukchon hanok village. This is like 15 minutes walk away from here. I did not see much of the street food vendors like those in Myeongdong."
251,5.0,"I go there for the art, shops, people watching and food. Make sure you explore the different alleys. Vendors are very foreigner friendly. Great place to pick up decent souvenirs that aren't found in Itaewon."
252,4.0,"Amongst the standard tourist souvenir shops are artesian art/ craft, tea, ceramics and house decore shops. Don't limit yourself to the main pedestrian street. Criss cross the narrow alleys and fon't fear getting lost as you can always link back to the central thorough fare. Prices are overall fair so don't go expecting to bargin hard."
253,5.0,"If you like cute stuff, you'll enjoy a wander in Insadong neighborhood. A lot of the shops are unique, one of a kind. From clothes to houseware to souvenirs, all super cute."
254,4.0,Did not spend a lot of time there but that 1 hour was nice as you ca find a lot of culture stuffs but DO NOT buy.. just google for the items and you can get the same item for lesser price.
255,5.0,"Whether or not you are a foodie you will love it!Steamy hot chestnuts was the first thing i grabbed at followed by a couple of egg-bread rolls then a quick stop for coffee. A couple of souvenir stalls later then came lunch.. bring those banchans on and slurp away at the soup. A quick skip hop and a nap then another coffee downed with a churro and a traditional pancake filled with sugar, cinnamon and nuts. A stroll down to open air mall to pick up the poo pancakes filled with chocolate. A trip to the cat shop with the bags, hats, pins, magnets and everything else feline and then to finish off this heavenly outing a box of emperors desserts. Angel hair made out of sugar and filled with nuts black sesames. Not forgetting to pick up dinner Tobboki and fishcake skewers a roll or kimbap and then faint on the bed :D"
256,4.0,"The place for visitors who are fancy arts as well as the traditional side of Korea. An array of shops selling traditional clothes, accessories and souvenirs. Traditional restaurants and kiosks of street foods are in the vicinity as well. For a unique shopping experience, head to Ssamziegil . There are a lot of novelty shops as well as caricature artists."
257,5.0,"This place is nothing short than amazing. Many cute little shops selling hand-made stuff, great food, locals hanging out. I loved it."
258,5.0,"Best of traditional Korean gifts, art and crafts along with historical spots and trendy shops and boutiques.  You can also get the best dumplings in the city!!!"
259,4.0,Even if you are not going to buy anything simply take a walk to this street and don't miss the Ssamji-gil mall.Here you will find some very good restaurants and free wifi on the street.
260,4.0,"Similar to a lot of streets like this, there was a huge assortment of shops. What made this interesting were the side streets with many small restaurants and shops. I found a number of fun places to snack on the arterial roads, and a nice place to have a set menu lunch. The location is very tourist friendly. Also a great place for souvenirs."
261,2.0,"If you have not time, you will not miss much...Touristic shops with a lot of non-local items... Didn't bought anything."
262,5.0,"Love Insadong, will always go for a stroll here if I have a chance. Don't bother to go to a proper restaurant - just have a chicken skewer from a cart at the end of the street. Close to a lot of other attractions: 2 palaces and a temple, great shopping and many places to duck into. Several metro stations nearby also."
263,5.0,"so many restaurants, so many coffee shops... you need not to eat for a week before coming here, if you are the type that wants to try it all ^^"
264,5.0,"If you wanna experience Korea, you should visit this place. Located in the middle of old town. Many things to see and enjoy. Souveniors can be purchased!"
265,5.0,Insadong is really nice place to hangout. There are alot of cafes here. It's not crowded like Myeongdong if you want to shop.
266,2.0,"I presume that this used to be a cultural and artistic area but sadly it's now been overrun with junky tourist shops selling plastic-wrapped trinkets and endless souvenirs.  To be fair, there are still gems amongst the tat - a few shops selling handmade paper, a couple of independent stationery stores.  And the art available there is attractive, but you don't need to look too closely to see that it's mass-produced.I found Bukchon Village, a little further north, to be far more atmospheric and charming.  And if you can get there, the Art Street in Gwangju, a city a few hours south of Seoul, is delightful, and presumably what Insadong used to look like, and wishes it still did.I walked up and down Insadong-gil a couple of times during my stay under the assumption that I'd missed the good bits, but I never found them!"
267,5.0,PROS: Not that touristy compared to Myeongdong. A lot of beautiful and cheap shops present. You can bargain too. Close to city center and Palaces.CONS: Noisy Turkish Ice Cream Seller! Shut up Dude!LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 5/5HOSPITALITY: 4/5ATTRACTIONS: 4/5
268,4.0,"I came here specially to look for hanji (handmade Korean paper), and there are several shops here that sell it. There were three shops that stood out for me. One is on the 2nd floor opposite Starbucks. Another one is at the end of the main Insadong road (he has reams of paper displayed outside his shop), and there's a Hanji paper artist in one of the side lanes who also uses hanji to create containers, vases etc. Unfortunately, his shop was closed when I visited on Sunday.There are also lots of other things that you can check out here. Traditional tea shops to sample Korean tea, shops to buy tea and tea making paraphernalia. There's the usual touristy souvenirs as are ceramics like celadon and other traditional Korean fine china/porcelain. I visited one craftsman who had a corner shop and sold cups, incense holders which also doubled as flower holders. A selection of his work featured Korean housescapes - tea cups, coffee mugs, long plates. They were very affordable, and made good gifts. But it is also good to browse around first, because the prices amongst shops can vary drastically for similar products. A tea filter and pot set cost 28000 KW at one shop, and another one further down was asking for 35000 KW. There's the multi-storey Ssamziegil shopping complex in the heart of Insadong. Here you find craft with a mix of the new and the traditional. The shops are connected by a walkway that winds its way to the top. You also have a choice of stairwells to climb up or down to the level you want to reach.It's a bit touristy, but also fun as the place comes alive with Friday night culture performances, weekend dance and singing performances. At the end of the street (closer to the Jongno 3 area) are lots of carts selling trinkets, food. And if you're keen on handmade books, there's a gentleman with a cart of handmade books. You can catch him making them on the premises.On both sides of the Insadong area, you can catch some noteworthy attractions. There's Jogyesa, an impressive Buddhist temple and Unhyeongung Palace, once the private residence of Joseon royalty. Both attractions are free to the public.Insadong is a good place to spend a few hours to absorb the culture of Korea."
269,4.0,"went my second time here to go around in the small streets and to look at all people walking around , and of course there is lot of foodplaces where you can eat"
270,3.0,Insadong district is an arty area of Séoul which you can combine after your visit to Gyengbokgung Palace as its just 5 to10 Mons walk away. The have some good shops but Souvenirs are cheaper elsewhere. There is one particular shop called Arirang which has good quality souvenirs for a very good less price compared to other shops with good selection of souvenirs
271,4.0,An arty pedestrian street obviously designed for shoppers and tourists. I stumbled upon it by accident. Lots of art and craft shops. I had an excellent in a traditional Korean restaurant on the Main Street. Worth checking out.
272,4.0,"Interesting ""arty"" side of the city. Lots of restaurants, street stalls, art & craft gift shops. However, beware, many are vastly over priced.I saw identical items for sale in other parts of town at half the price of the Insadong shops- so be ware."
273,2.0,Do not buy any souvenir item from Isadong. The items are grossly overpriced many times over. I bought a nail cutter souvenir at 5000 won (USD4.5). I had later bought another 10 (same item) at 7000 won from Dongdaemun.Isadong is a tourist trap and a big ripoff. It is ok just to walk around.
274,4.0,Street vendors galore selling the latest in tacky trinkets and souvenirs as well as street food. There's also a few restaurants dotted about. Worth spending an afternoon there- though in heavy rain the street became rather flooded! Go when it's dry.
275,3.0,I walked around here during the day and also in the evening. Seems better to go in the evening. It's worth a visit as I said but not too exciting.
276,5.0,I walked here from my hotel in Myongdong. Stop by the tourist booth at the beginning of the street for a map of the neighborhood.  One of my favorite places was Ssamziegil with lots of cool and unique stores. I liked the one on the ground floor with dog and cat designs on things. This is also the place with the bathrooms!  There are also the ubiquitous food vendors lining the street which I hear is closed to traffic on Sunday's. On the narrow side streets are some places to have tea.
277,5.0,"Been to Seoul twice and I went back to InsaDong a number of times during each trip. I just LOVE this place. You can buy souvenirs for almost everyone in your family or friends here. Great restaurants too! One restaurant that I went back to on my second trip is Gogung, which is located at the basement of Ssamziegil (a shopping center located in InsaDong). Explore the shops and galleries. Don't get disheartened if you don't get bargains or deals on your first shop. There's always one shop that would be more than willing to do business with you and show you enough patience. :)"
278,5.0,"Hundreds of little shops carrying all kinds of trinkets and artwork, souvenirs and whatnot. Left and right into the alleys are all kinds of small restaurants and other fun stuff. A lot of tourists of course, but a place like this is nothing without them. A must visit if in Seoul."
279,4.0,opposite Jogesa Temple. Nice shopping street. full with artisan  and handmade goods. You can rent Hanbok  to dress and shopping around.
280,4.0,"shops with knickknacks-souvenirs, fast food stall and small restaurants, many bakeries and 'sweets'- specialty stores - most places close immediately ones tourists leave the temple - about 5 pm"
281,4.0,"If you want to see outdated gallery this is the place for you but if you want a very good food and great atmosphere, this is the place for you. Try to avoid the stream and let yourself lost in the many allies, you will find very unique stuff."
282,5.0,"You will find lovely 3-4 stars hotels in this neighbourhood. Best location to visit the palaces, shrines and temples. Plenty of small shops selling souvenirs. Easy access by two metro stations and airport bus. Not to mention the local restaurants offering delicious food day and night. Good also for art and galeries."
283,4.0,The insadong area is definetly recommended. Espacially the Insadong-gil (street) has a lot of Shops with good art and handcraft. It might be a good place to buy a souvenir from Korea. And it is a good starting point to continue towards north to Bukchon Hanok Vilaage or the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Can be easily done on a day.
284,5.0,"Insadong is an unusual marketplace alley as it's focused exclusively on the arts and culture of South Korea.  You'll find lots of paintings, craftwork and Korean tea merchandise dotted at both sides of the walkway.  The interesting bit about this area is that the restaurants are somewhat hidden at the back of the alley.  There are a couple of very busy restaurants in those small enclaves and they're usually crowded during lunchtime."
285,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Seoul. Great place to eat street vendor snacks-- try a hotteok pancake or dduk (rice cake), have a dojang (name stamp) carved while you wait (stationery addict so I researched  it and went to Myung Sin Dang Pilbang), beautiful brass (VERY expensive) as well as authentic (NOT Chinese!) celadon stores."
286,4.0,Hundreds of little shops and stalls offering a vast collection of souvenirs and art products. If you tastes are musical instruments then there are many shops with a good range of products. This area is near the JONGNO 3 (Sam)-gu - exit 3. It's worth a visit.
287,3.0,"This is definitely a pleasant stroll.  It is Seoul on a human scale and, except for an occasional vehicle, a pedestrian street.But let’s call it what it is:  It’s a tourist zone (I wouldn’t call it a tourist trap), where you can find souvenirs and trinkets for yourselves, friends or relatives.  It does have its share of genuine crafts stores as well, however.  It is also chock full of restaurants and tea houses.Personally, I found the prices generally higher here than in the less touristy sections of the city.  But if you are seeing Seoul on a tight schedule, this is the place where you can kill several birds with one stone.  It is possible to leave this district and claim to have sipped tea in a traditional tea house, eaten a meal of Korean food and stocked up on souvenirs for those at home. How authentic and representative of Seoul it is another matter.  The area is certainly historic but an overwhelming percentage of the buildings are not.  Still, it is a nice place to stroll and people watch, especially as the sun goes down and the place starts to light up.  Just be aware that many of the people that you watch will not be Korean.  Keep an eye out for the resident Hare Krishna devotee handing out literature and the older man who plays the violin (badly) for tips, hopefully to pay for sorely needed lessons.If you’re in search of, perhaps, a slightly more authentic side of Insadong, stray off Insadong-gil into the side streets and wander aimlessly there."
288,4.0,If you want to find good Korean souvenir items then Insadong is the best place to visit. It's also near to some Korean palaces.
289,4.0,It is a must to go Insadong for shopping of korean souvenirs. Though very crowded but also a good chance to experience the good vibes and mood and enjoy the nice and tempting smell from the food stands
290,5.0,"In this place, you can enjoy Korean traditional shops, cafes and restaurants. This street is very famous for Koreans from other cities and foreigners and worth to visit. Seoul citizens visit this place mostly to enjoy cafes and restaurants. I am a Seoul citizen , so I visit this place to enjoy Korean traditional cafes and restaurants."
291,5.0,"Insadong has it all! Shopping, cozy tea rooms, good restaurants, and more! Great place to spend an afternoon exploring!"
292,5.0,Stopped by this place during our city bus tour and was able to buy loads of souvenirs for family and friends back home. Dont immediately buy the first few items that you see. In my case I found out that the stores farther along the streets of Insadong offered much better deals. 😊😊
293,5.0,"No wonder this area is one of the most visited attractions of Seoul. It is a traditional streets where you can find an eclectic bunch of interesting items: shopping sites, simple and fancy restaurants, hotels, walking areas, craft, clothes and food vendors and whatever you look for."
294,5.0,Wasn't sure before I went but so glad I stayed here.  Great area.  Lots to see and do - close to all the palaces and transport.  Certainly a good base for trips in Seoul.
