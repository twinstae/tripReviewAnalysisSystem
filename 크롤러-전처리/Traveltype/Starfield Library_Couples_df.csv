1,5.0,A wonderful place for reading and catching up some knowledge that feeds the mind. A place to have some quiet time to spend and reflect and resetting goals for 2020. An amazing huge library full of thousands of books with amazing people around having the same thoughts and mind to increase their knowledge that feeds and blossom the mind. A wonderful ambience and environment to be in; there are plenty of cafes nearby this library ☺️☺️☺️

In COEX there are lots of Shopping Malls, Restaurants, Coffee shops, Hotels, Playing area.. you name it. Everything is there. But there is one place you should not skip while you are in COEX. “THE STARFIELD LIBRARY” Its free of entry. I visited and I was amazed with the library. The library is gigantic, unique and believe me lots and lots of books.  (Check my pictures – you can feel it)It’s a paradise for book lovers! I would say its worth to visit and you will love it."
