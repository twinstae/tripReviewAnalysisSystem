0,3.0,"The space and the collection are absolutely exquisite, are presented immaculately and free from distractions. It was truly one of the best things I've seen, not only in Korea, but all of Asia on our month long trip. I'm glad to have seen it. 5/5The tour (which is the only way to experience the museum) suffered from many issues. To her credit, our guide's English was fine. Unfortunately, at an hour, the pacing was at break-neck speed, with perhaps 1-2 minutes per display through the main collection. The guides delivery felt impersonal and robotic. No sooner had we sat down, then we were on our feet again moving to the next space. Time was spent dropping names and brands when cultural context and interesting features were glossed over (e.g. the traditional moss garden, something entirely unheard of to my western ears, was mentioned only in passing in pointing out what the G20 first wives were looking out onto during their lunch here).With no photography allowed inside, such short dwell time, and no question time or literature available about the collection, it feels like there are wonders in this museum which no visitor will ever discover, which is a tragedy not only for the museum and the visitors, but for Korean culture.The space and the collection are already world class. With more consideration, a slower pace and genuine interaction and hospitality, a tour which would do it justice is possible. Unfortunately, this is not what you should expect for now."
1,4.0,"A visit to this private museum must be arranged up to three days in advance via the online reservation system on their website, this way I secured the day and time that best suited our itinerary.  The museum is located on a hill not easily connected by public transport, most visitors we saw came by private car.  We chose to arrive and depart on foot which was the hardest thing about the afternoon.  If you choose to walk like us take the main road from Hansung University Subway station, allow forty five minutes.Once we arrived at the museum's entrance gate we were taken to a small guest lounge to wait until our guide arrived and make the payment for the tour: cash and card is accepted.  There are toilet facilities but no souvenir/snacks/drinks shop.Our guide explains to us that no photography is allowed except in the 'Photo zone'; designated areas outside the building.  Over the next hour our guide is very informative describing the owners, the history of these gorgeous designed buildings, garden design and shown the views from the garden terrace.  Then we are taken inside the buildings and shown around many rooms to get an appreciation of traditional Korean lifestyle.  We are lead downstairs to furniture museum where the collection is described to us: construction materials, purpose and age. For the later part of the tour we are taken into a private room where we take off our shoes and sit on the floor and admire the beauty inside and the views out.  The building and wooden furniture were beautiful to discover, but I feel that the entrance fee of 20000 won was expensive for an one hour tour."
2,5.0,"Entrance is ONLY by prior reservation. $20 entry fee is well worth what you see in this unique ""hanuk"".  The flawless English-speaking guide is well versed in the history of the royal dynasty and explains and answers all questions with ease.  The name ""Furniture Museum"" is misleading as this is much more than just furniture display.  If possible, ask for advance ""high tea"" catered at 3pm after the 2pm hour long guided tour.  Catered by a French bakery.  Photography inside is not permitted."
