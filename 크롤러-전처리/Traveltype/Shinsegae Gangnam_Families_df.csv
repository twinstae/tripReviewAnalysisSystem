0,4.0,Just next to express bus terminal. Many choices for eateries and 12 floors of shopping !  Cinema is within the building too ....
1,4.0,"I don't really shop at departments stores in Korea but often hang out with my family while I'm visiting. Each location might be different but there's about 12~13 floors in total. The basement is the market, food court, bakeries, grab-n-go foods and etc. The 1st floor is cosmetics/accessories and the other floors are divided into women, men, kid's, shoes, bags and etc. The top floors have many different restaurants with variety of cuisines. This mall can get VERY busy on weekends so try to avoid at all cost! (Don't even think about it on holidays...) Lunch rush can be crazy and the wait time for restaurants take forever. You'll see an older crowd during week days since it's the perfect place to hang out during the day with shopping, restaurants and cafes. This mall is so clean and all staff are very polite and helpful. The best time to visit is in the morning if you want to avoid crowds."
2,4.0,"This is my 200th review. I have spent more time in Shinsegae Gangnam than any other place in Seoul other than my in-laws' home, so I am happy that Shinsegae is a milestone review! My family and I have been coming here for at least ten years and have always liked shopping here. With a wave of recent renovations this branch of Shinsegae has become even more impressive in the past two years. It has added a ton of branded kiosks in the basement area that were previously other non-Shinsegae retail and food.My wife's friend, a Korean who has spent a lot of time in NY, recently said ""I can get pretty much anything I want at Shinsegae."" This is more or less true: just in the basement there is a Dean & DeLuca, a wine store, grocery with food from around the world, Japanese rice balls, rectangular pizza cooked Sicilian-style sold by the slice, on and on. There are a few caveats to this astute statement. First, you will not be able to get not exactly what were looking for, something in the neighborhood of what you wanted Second, you will pay a premium, and often a hefty premium, for what you want to buy. For example, a half of an American flank steak cost KRW 60,000. You will pay 20% more here for beer that can also get at your local Seoul convenience store.These semi-negative comments aside, I enjoy visiting Shinsegae Gangnam because: 1) it is at the Gangnam Express Bus Terminal, so it is very convenient for the 3, 7, 9 subway lines2) the basement grocery and food court offer an amazing array of goods from around the world3) the merchandise from the top floor to bottom is top-notch4) it's easier for non-Koreans like me to shop and eat in this complex, as opposed to ""regular Seoul"" where things are not as foreigner-friendlyThe recent renovations have increased the quality of food and merchandise in the complex overall. The new Mega Box movie theater is a welcome addition, and the Famille Station food court has, in effect, moved the Shinsegae 10th floor restaurants to the B1 level. All of these upgrades are part of a Korean retail ""arms race"". There's a similar (and even newer) complex at the COEX location a few Metro stops away.Make no mistake...visiting Seoul Shinsegae is fun and its existence is very welcome. However, it's expensive, and the sprawl of Shinsegae has squeezed out the basement ""shijang"" that makes Seoul special.One more suggestion - do not take a cab or drive here! The 3, 7, 9 lines all stop here, and it's easy to transfer from the 4 (which stops at Myeungdong and Seoul Station) to the 7 at Isu Junction. There's a big parking lot below this massive complex, but it adds stress, aggravation, and time to the whole experience. Recommended."
3,5.0,AMAZING AMAZING place. So many things to eat and see. You could spend a week in here and not see it all. High end as well as everyday things. Even more choices of dinning and coffee.
4,4.0,"So this place is a real hub because JW Marriot is here, the bud terminal is here and there is also a really big shopping mall. there are a lot of places to eat here. My favourity shop was this men's clothing shop which also did 3D printing. So for about USD100. you can get a mini-statue of yourself!! Quite interesting."
