0,3.0,"There are nothing about this store for it to stand out among the numerous retail offerings in Seoul -- so why waste time? The merchandise is offered at all the better outlets at equivalent prices -- the Food Court at Doota is inferior to that of most every other store in town and even the terrace is small, cluttered, enclosed and disappointing. Don't waste your precious time!"
1,4.0,There are levels of shops with local brands to shop for here. The prices are quite expensive. Duty free shopping requires passport.

3,3.0,"Well, the best thing about Doota is their different flyers with promotions. You can get it in the street and inside the mall. Be very attentive reading it since you can get:1. Free Face sheet mask!2. 5,000 W (~$5) coupon for meal at their food court downstairs3. Additional coupon book for shopping (10%-30% discount)4. A package of 3-in-1 coffee sachets (10 pcs)5. A 5,000 W coupon for shopping in Duty Free Shop. You will need a passport or a copy of passport for registration (at the hall and on the 13th floor) also a copy of your return ticket (or picture on the phone).Those were pros.Cons: Extremely poor English there... Only Lush consultants can speak normal English.Not all staff knows about above mentioned promos incl administration (13 th floor) and brand sellers... Many of them look at us very suspiciously and angdy not knowing what to do at all.Re prices: high to very high. Do not recommend it for shopping actually. You can find cheaper prices."
4,4.0,Got a brochure from the tourist information office and found 2 freebies in it - 1. Free face mask 2. 5000krw voucher to use in the food court. Why not? The discounts provided in the book is also good (with Conditions so do check before purchase) if you are looking to spend in the duty free section of doota. Only thing is stuff are priced in USD at duty free and the deals they offer are slightly different from the regular shops. Only place I found a pink fong shop that sells the mic in English! (the brand that started the baby shark fever). Also super happy they have a supermarket called no brand that sells a lot of goods at really affordable prices when compared to your convenience stalls. Overall a good mall to hang out in if you can't sleep as they close late.

6,5.0,"Great place to shop for souvenirs.  I personally rested for a short while at Auntie Anne's on the 4th floor, but still explored all floors.  We just bought 2 articles of clothing and 3 pieces of jewelry.  Definitely not many options for guys, but a paradise for someone looking to shop for gals!"
7,3.0,"This is probably the best place & the only ""bright spark"" in an otherwise uninteresting Dongdaemun. A decent nice mall with nice shops & ambience.However, what you see here can be found in other malls in Seoul as well. Dongdaemun isn't a very interesting place as compared to shopping streets like Myeongdong, Hongdae, Namdaemun.We usually skip this place in our visits but drop by only if we have time only to kill."
8,5.0,I love this mall. It has everything I need in there. From luxury ready to wear to cosmetics and electronics! And it closes at 5am!
9,3.0,This place is best seen at night with all the neon lights.  The shopping centres are pretty average and not far from the metro station.  The highlight of the trip is the big Owl and big bear!
