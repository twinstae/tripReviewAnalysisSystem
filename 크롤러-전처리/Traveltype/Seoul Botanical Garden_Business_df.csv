0,5.0,"This is a fine botanical park which is under preparation. Currently, they allow a free temporary visit for limited facilities. Good to visit for families and couples. For tourists to enjoy flowers too.- Not famous yet. There aren't many visitors.- The grand opening is May, 2019. Prior to that, it opened to the public on Oct 11, 2018. Many facilities were still under preparation when we visited.- The entrance is free for some time.- A huge park with kid playgrounds, exhibition halls, flower gardens, snack bars, cafeterias, etc.- The main botanical garden is the highlight and very amusing. Lots of interesting plants, balloons, a sky bridge, etc.- How to reach: AREX & Line #9 Magoknaru is right outside the entrance. Line #5 Magok is pretty far to walk. The location is a bit away from the center of Seoul.- Good to enjoy cherry blossoms and fall foliages.- The pond is large and so peaceful. There's a huge I Seoul U sign near the pond.- The park is supposed to reach until Hangang(Han River). But, it was under construction when we visited."
