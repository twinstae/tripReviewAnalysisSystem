0,4.0,"It is located within Gyeongbokgung Palace. Entrance is free. Inside the museum, you can collect beautiful stamps. A brief history about the past Korea. A lot of exhibition changing from time to time. Make sure to come here when you are in Seoul."
1,5.0,Entrance to the museum is free and audio guides of various languages can be obtained at the information desks at 1k KRW. The audio guide is user friendly which detects exhibits automatically so you dont have to key in anything. The museum is well kept and organised and gives good explanation to the Josean dynasty. Worth going if you are heading to Gyeongbukgung grounds.
2,5.0,I felt walking through here that a lot was expected from crown prince from birth that from the age of 5 it was constant preparation to lead a country and to be a great king. Not that it was easier on crown princess.It makes you reflect on the weight of a kingdom.
3,4.0,The palace museum shows a large collection and explanations of different king dynasties and different royal belongings during the last centuries.
4,4.0,"Museum currently has an exhibit of things from Lichtenstein. While cool, it takes up most of the museum which leaves not a lot of information on Korean palaces. Overall, museum does a good job explaining what you are seeing and setting you up for Gyeongbokgung which is next door."
5,5.0,"This place is another heaven for history lovers! The museum can be found inside the compound of Gyeongbokgung Palace, and does not charge admission fee. It is a huge place with various galleries that offer a clear glimpse of the past of South Korea. Displays inside the museum are traditional Korean costumes wore for different types of occasions, various artifacts from different eras, records, etc. I spent more than an hour touring the entire museum. It has a souvenir store at the lower ground floor. In addition, it also has a display of the various car models sponsored by famous car manufacturing company of South Korea. For car lovers, this display is located right in front of the souvenir shop. This museum is highly recommended for everyone, especially for heritage lovers.PS: This museum was also featured in the Legend of the Blue Sea. Another K-Drama Filming location bucket list."
6,4.0,"I visited this museum three years ago. Then I was impressed by the English speaking guide who walked the two of us around the exhibits and answered our many questions.Besides the regular exhibits, this museum occasionally holds special exhibitions, sometimes with a small charge but equally often free.On this occasion, there was a display of royal seals that had somehow ended up in a museum in the United States.One of the last acts by President Obama was the return of these cultural and historical objects to their rightful home.In times of conflict, many fine cultural and historically significant objects are looted and removed from their homeland.It's good that these were returned and not held in the US.I am against the idea of things like these in private collections.This museum is well curated and things are nicely displayed. There is plenty of room and several rest areas.'Lockers are available at a small charge and the rest rooms are immaculate."
7,5.0,Pretty big museum. Right by one of the main temples. Entrance is free. So rich in history. Good souvenirs. 1F is under renovation
8,5.0,"Unless you have a guide, or even if you do, this is a great stop at the beginning of any tour of the palace."
9,5.0,"For history, this is the place you must see. Well detailed and preserve.Free entrance, fyi. Near the Gyeobokgung Palace.Station Gyeobokgung."
10,4.0,"I found this museum to be well organized and easy to follow. The exhibits were not crowded, but were well appointed with care and artistry. I liked the vehicle that the emperor traveled in. It was beautifully restored and displayed. Right next to it was the conveyance where the emperor was carried not he shoulders of bearers in earlier times.This was part of a tour given for airline travelers waiting for flights that had a stopover of more than 6 hours. It was well worth the time for the tour. Right across the street we saw a parade with men dressed in costume marching across the square."
11,4.0,"I was very much curious about the Joseon Dynasty since in the Korean drama series, even in Hot Brain Problematic Men, they all mentioned about this dynasty. I was able to understand why people mostly referred to that dynasty."
12,5.0,"The museum is located adjacent to Gyeongbokgung Palace and accessible through Subway Line 3 to Gyeongbokgung Station. The admission is free of charges. The museum definitely worth visiting and we enjoyed exploring the very interesting items exhibited overs several floor, including the royal classic cars."
13,4.0,"The museum is very well-designed and entrance, as in most cultural places in Seoul, is free. The museum is very close to the large palace of Gyeongbokgung. Avoid visiting on a Monday, it is closed then.The various galleries have magnificent displays from the Joseon dynasty, from paintings and screens to costumes and ceremonial robes or from furniture to ritual instruments. I particularly enjoyed the 8-fold screen of King Jeongjo's Procession to an ancestral tomb in Hwaseong."
14,4.0,"Entrance to the museum is free. Very clean, upmarket and interesting. You can take guided tours in English,Korean, Japanese and Chinese."
15,3.0,"I visit this museum over a short time period of 1 Hour, while waiting for the Blue House tour. Time seems not sufficient and hence will come back.. since admission is free and it's just beside gyeongbokgung. It's also the first point of attractions from the exit of the Gwanghwamun Station."
16,3.0,"We arrived here in cold winter and the snow is everywhere outside, making a beautiful snow scene. I was a bit tired so I went to the cafe here. Just order ordinary coffee cause the flavor is average, no surprise. But the scene outside is marvellous! So enjoy your coffee time here, just to sit for an hour!"
17,3.0,Small museum focused on Korean history since about 1500s but there's a broad selection of artifacts that are thoughtfully displayed. English signage is rare but apparently there are rare tours in English available.
18,5.0,"We went on the English Tour at the National Palace Museum of Korea.  A good guide makes a great difference in not only explaining the exhibits, but communicating the history and subtleties of what occured throughout the dynasty periods.  The exhibits covered categories of palace items including transportation, musical instruments, royal chairs, screens, etc.  Our guide communicated with a love of the history of her country that made the exhibits come alive.  The museum is relatively small, which allows for a slow pace of examining the items as there is no fear of not finishing in a reasonable period of time.There is also an excellent cafe located on the mid level, as well as easy access to the Gyeobokdung subway station underneath the museum.This museum appears to not be on a regular tourist suggestion list, but was more enjoyable that being in the midst of large crowds trying to ""see"".Note:  most exhibits did not have extended information in English.  It is strongly suggested to arrange your schedule so that you are there for an ""English"" tour.  Ours was at 11:00, another at 2:30.This museum shares the same ticket with the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  We returned the next day instead, and found that it had free admission on the Saturday that we were there."
19,4.0,During a business trip to South Korea I had the chance to do some sight seeing i Seoul. It covers mostly the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) and their 27 kings.Most impressiv was the water clock and also the level of science in the early years.I would say that you need at least three hours to go through the museum.
