3,5.0,"Bongeunsa is an amazing place: a large temple complex that sits across the street from a busy shopping mall-hotel complex, and which is surrounded by tall buildings of the new town. The grounds have several old, traditional temple buildings, as well as a semi-circular open-air plaza with a tall statue of Maitreya, that we could see from our hotel. The main temple hall is beautifully decorated with lotus shaped lanterns and wood paintings. The temple is in active use and one sees locals performing prayers - very serene and peaceful experience."

6,5.0,"There are several temples in Bongeunsa, and it is a reverential experience. The prayers, the big Buda statue, the gardens, all are marvelous."
7,4.0,"Very interesting because this temple is situated in the middle of the city. A visit here gives the opportunity to escape the city life and breathe. We also took part in a calligraphy lession with a monk, which I highly recommend."

11,3.0,Nice place for an evening stroll if you are staying in the area and looking for a change of scenery.
12,4.0,"For business in Seoul, I had the opportunity to see the temple while a ceremony was on going. Very colorful, with a big statue in marble. Wonderful the small Buddhas present in the grass. Look for them while walking"
13,4.0,Fortunate that I stayed at the hotel across Bongeunsa Temple.  It was a nice walk inside -- serene and you'll hear the prayers and see the practice.  30mins walk is enough.
14,3.0,Was attending a trade show across the road so took some time to visit the temple. Really nice temple and good experience but they need more signs and information in English. Didnâ€™t have time to sign up for a tour but when you walk through you are not sure if you are allowed to take photos when you go into the different temple rooms. Did spend some quiet time in front of one of the shrines and was very relaxing.  Definitely worth a visit but if you have time get a guide to make the most of it.
15,5.0,"The Representative Buddhist Temple in the center of newly organized downtown. Of course the Bongeunsah Temple has been already located here before the development of newly organized downtown. Because the surrounding environment became a building forest, the Bongeunsah Temple became a natural and cozy site."
16,5.0,"I love this place and it holds many memories for me. When I was working in the Samsung area I would come here often to escape the crazy city. It is calm and clear when I'm there. The noises melt away a bit. My friend went here to eat vegetarian meals (which are hard to find in Korea), and I came here to mediate and walk around like an old man. I'd often sit BEHIND the statue and watch the people come and pray. It sounds weird but I loved making up stories for everyone as they passed haha. Now that I actually am an older man (before I was 22), I came back with a filming crew to show them this amazing spot and the crazy juxtaposition of the city and the temple. They loved it too. It's a great spot if you're in Seoul, especially if you don't have time to get out of the city and you want to see a temple. Easy access from the subway line 2, or line 9."
17,5.0,"The gongs sounds twice a day - 4:20 am and 6:20 pm - which you can hear if you stay at a hotel nearby. The grounds are free to wander, and it's a peaceful place to walk after a busy day around the city. Small gift shop with buddhist souvenirs."
18,5.0,Spent a half day walk around enjoying the Serenity in a Concrete Jungle. This is a wonderful place of Peace and Quiet in a Bustling City of Glass and Steel
19,5.0,Spent a couple of hours moving around the temple complex.  Lots of people in prayer at the Temple.   The temple offers a temple stay where you can stay overnight at the temple and learn about Buddism.
20,4.0,"This was well worth the time and price. I learned a lot and experienced temple activities with people from around the world - tea, meditation, a craft and a well-explained visit."
21,5.0,"Scenic place, you feel 'different' when you visit it. I recommend joining prayers in the main temple."
22,5.0,Ask for a tour.  It's free and you will learn so much more than if you just stroll the grounds.   And you might just make a new friend like I did.
23,5.0,"I visited this place twice. Is a special temple with an unique atmosphere, between modernity and tradition. The soul of Seoul."
24,5.0,"Just across the street from coex, this extremely beautiful temple just has it all.Peaceful and bewildering Buddhist temple which is quite large with a lot to see.Try being there early- at around 5am - to see the Buddhist prayers and get the calming sensation.It is well worth the visit and taking part in the activities."
25,4.0,"Just across the busy COEX you can find this oasis. Sometimes monks are praying. As everything is written in Korean and i am not a Buddhist, it was impossible to follow anything. So i just enjoyed the tranquility of the temples. Wonderful."
26,4.0,"There are many cultural and religion activities all year round in this temple complex, location is very good on the side of hill in Gangnam area with concrete forest.the grand hall is extraordinarily beautiful, the gift shop is also interesting.  Big Bodhisatrava towering the temple with background of foliages chaning colors is beautiful."
27,5.0,"Surrounded by busy traffic avenues and high rise building, this is a complex of several buildings (diverse uses including accommodation) interspersed with charming gardens.  Didn't have much time there and arrived too late for the Thursday tour - you have to be there by 1.50pm - so will try for that next time."
28,5.0,"This is in a very busy business district. It is an oasis. Relaxing and contemplative. After a long day or early in the morning, replenish your soul."
29,5.0,Spent an hour here just unwinding and gathering some energy. The singing in the temples was really nice and something I hadn't had a chance to experience in Europe.
30,4.0,"Great place to visit, if you are in this Coex business district or in the area. Active buddhist temple that takes up quite a lot of space in the neighborhood. Flyers available Guide you and for further information are available in English and the languages.A moment of relaxation in an otherwise busy city. Wonderful."
31,4.0,"This temple is centrally located in the Gingham district and is very beautiful. I walked to this place and spend some time. If you are in the area, it is a must visit. The temple has a huge statue of Budha."

33,5.0,I was there the day before Buddha's Birthday and got to see all the colorful decorations they'd put up. Very nice and lovely place in the middle of town. Beautiful park area. Very peaceful.
34,5.0,It's a beautiful temple that is currently in use for worship. The sound of the monks chanting could be heard as I wandered among the buildings. Absolutely wonderful.
35,4.0,We had a quick visit to this temple which is right across the Intercontinental hotel. Since it was End of winter not much crowd It is beautiful and tranquil. We enjoyed the visit.
36,4.0,"It's ironic that COEX, one of the absolute symbols of capitalism, consumer culture and gambling is across the street. But perhaps it's also fitting in that if offers a quite, calming and peaceful juxtaposition to the ordered chaos of Seoul. Go without expectations, comfortable shoes to roam and walk up and down the grounds and stairs and a please, please, please turn off your cell phone."
37,5.0,"Loved the place, free entrance and quite a number of spots for making photos, really nice place to visit. Just take care not to bother the people praying, as the rooms are still in use :-)It's possible to get a tour on the entrance."
38,5.0,"I just love this place, a short walk for this gardens connect you with the heart of Korea. Peaceful, powerful and beauty."
39,5.0,This is a special place. Like a land that time forgot. I often tell folks who are just passing through Seoul to make this the one thing they go see because it's just unique to find this place of zen in the middle of this bustling city.
40,5.0,"It is near by COEX aquarium at Samseong subway station. It is ver big enough regarded as Lung os Seoul' which provide quite park space for those who are tired. It is very close to CBM (central business district of Samseong: Trade Tower, COEX). Monk Exam had been held here. Belong to Jogye sect and produced famous monk eg. Bowoo."
41,5.0,"It's a benefit for those attending conferences at Coex to have this beautiful, 8th century temple nearby. Given conventions are intense affairs, even with Coex being a great facility, this is a gift--a way for people not only to get fresh air, but also a taste of (non touristy) Korean culture that's authentic and used by ""real people."" There's also a nice shop outside the front gate and many little tucked away sanctuaries."
42,5.0,This temple is located in front of the Intercontinental Coex hotel and is a oasis of peace and beauty. I went there everyday even when I worked long hours. The shop sells beautiful collections of teas. Inside this temple there is the National Meditation Centre and there are opportunities for retreats and tasters. I did the two hours taster - mediation and tea ceremony. It was lovely.
43,3.0,"This is a Buddhist temple near the Coex Center. The entrance and the buildings are beautiful, but it's a rather quick walk to see everything. Go into one of the temples. They are beautiful and very peaceful."
44,5.0,"At the entrance you find a small stream and a pathway going up towards a temple. As you walk up the pathway, religious art starts to appear and soon you can here sounds and Buddhist chants coming from the temple. Little after you're basically at the edge of a forest, you can still hear the dim noise of the roads but it only adds to your feeling of surprise and relax.It's a gem. It will make your day alone."
45,5.0,"located in a nice park, those few temples are beautiful and well restored. A few beautiful warriors statues welcome you at the front gate, and an impressive Buddha statue takes center stage further, with religious people praying here and there, some chanting inside other building, the ringing bells gave a very spiritual atmosphere to the place"
46,4.0,"In the busiest city center of Gangnam (the Sothern Side of the Han River in Seoul), there is a temple which is very quiet. You can walk slowly along a path in the temple."
47,5.0,"A great place to visit. A guided tour, followed by a tea ceremony, and then making a paper water Lilly and then finally a meditation session. A great experience."
48,5.0,"This beautiful buddhist temple is 1200 years old. It is like a little park with many buildings to visit. There is a very impressive 23 meter tall Buddha. It is still a very active religious site, with monks chanting and praying, people meditating etc. As a tourist you have to respect the religious activities that take place all around you. Entrance is free, and I really enjoyed the experience."
49,5.0,"The historical sites in Seoul can have a repetitive feel to them, as the architecture from the Jeosun period all looks very much the same. This one is really worth seeing for itself, however. It is a working temple, and if you come at the right time (Sunday morning for me), you can see (and participate in) various religious services or simply stand back and observe people coming to venerate the giant Buddha at the top of the hill."
50,5.0,Just infant of the COEX centre. One of the most important religious places in Seoul. Free access to the temple.
51,4.0,Huge temple complex with many separate buildings just opposite the COEX building. A taste of old and quiet Korean life in a hectic traffic jam and business district.
52,4.0,The history and culture of the place was so great and enjoyable. The people were friendly but English language for guiding tourists was not enough.
53,5.0,Its a very big temple complex and well worth a visit and probably more gnd settingand  than the other big one in central Seoul.. Nice place to visit and take lots of photos. Also very relaxing grounds to wander around
54,4.0,Directly opposite the Coex and creates a lovely calm atmosphere for a lunchbreak after a hectic day.
55,5.0,This area is a wonderful meditative site in the midst of the noise & pollution of city centre. Some temples over 1200 years old. Should be a must visit.
56,5.0,"Very nice! Guided tours, with munk and tea is possible. It was a wonderful place, vivant and pulsating as it is used by the local population."
57,5.0,I liked the fact that the temple is located in such a place that you can always easily visit and relax in a middle of a work day. Beautiful scenery in the middle of the city famous business center.
58,5.0,"Even if you're not a Buddhist (I am not) this is worth a visit. A beautiful park right inside downtown Seoul, it provides a relief to the hustle and bustle of the work at hand. I stayed in the hotel right next to the temple (COEX Interncontinental) and didn't mind being woken at 4am each morning when the bell was gonged. The ceremonial bell ringing occurs at 4am and at around dusk (6pm when I was there) and I happened upon it by accident, and ended up staying for approximately 30 minutes to watch the proceedings. Fun, interesting, refreshing.This is a must-visit in April since the flowers are absolutely gorgeous."
59,5.0,"What a place! A big and ancient buddhist temple in the middle of the busy Gangnam district. Right across the street from the COEX convention center. It's alive as well. All day long tourists are outnumbered by worshippers. I made an offering for a friend via the office. You can write a card and someone will hang it under a lampoon in the great hall 200.000 won for a year. It made me happy.`oh, don't forget to visit the tea bar in front next to the buddhist souvenir shop."
60,3.0,The temple was under heavy remodel when I went (feb 2015) but was still interesting to walk thru and see the huge statue in the back. If I was limited on time though I would recommend going to the main palace instead.
61,5.0,The temple area is located directly across from the COEX Mall. The site covers a large area and there are a lot of different buildings in the complex to view. The buildings are colorful and traditional. There are a variety of statuary and landscape effects. There are explanations of each building and good literature in a variety of languages available at the entrance. I spent about 40 minutes to walk around the area and that didn't cover everything.
62,5.0,"Very peaceful place to visit while I was on my 10 days business trip at the Coex opposite building of the temple. You need a good shoes and at least 2 hours to browse around, amazing wood craft on each building, very colorfu. Very very beautiful Cherry blossom in April. Great day out."
63,4.0,It's a very hot day and for some reasons there were many visitors gathered in the temple and listening to some broadcasting. One can really appreciate the old temple and know a bit more on the history of Korea. It's a nice walk around the place and there is a 'pool' where people can enjoy the naturally cold water from the mountain. Loads of statues probably made of wood. Enjoy this place very much.
64,5.0,A Buddhist complex with a number of different structures.  I was lucky to be there for a service in the main building and it was a thing of beauty.  Even without a service there is a calm and serenity to be found here that is a welcome respite from the mayhem of Seoul.  I'd like to try one of the temple stays here sometime.
65,3.0,This temple is in the Gangnam area. This is probably the only thing that is noticeable.  I have been in Narita some month ago to see the Narita-san and this one seems very little comparing. The Buddha is new and in concrete. So why not if you are near Gangnam area.
66,5.0,"This is an oasis in the busy city.  Guides are very helpful.  There are ample opportunities to learn about Buddhist practices and participate.  It was especially nice that there wasn't constant pressure to donate, but there are plenty of opportunities to give discreetly where you want. There are also a nice tea shop and gift shop just outside the main gates."
67,5.0,"We were in Gangnam on business, and visited this place which is right behind the COEX center. I was highly impressed with this place, the lanterns, the lights, the statutes and the amazing view of Seoul.You can witness an absolute serenity with the buddhist worshippers of the statute behind you, as you gaze on the skyline of Seoul. It's like an oasis of peace and quiet in the middle of a busy city. We went just before the sun started going down, and it was a breathtaking sight.Definitely worth a visit!"
68,4.0,"Located in the middle of bustling Gangnam, and across the street from Seoul COEX, this 1200 year old temple is a nice respite from the urban jungle around it.  Still very much an operational temple, with locals praying as a daily routine at the temple.  For visitors, there are many spots that call out the uniqueness of Korean Buddhism, such as the colorful ceilings, white lanterns, large drum, and huge Buddha statue."
69,4.0,Well worth a visit to take the hustle and bustle of the city down a notch or two. You will find a strange spiritual aura descending on you as you walk round!
70,5.0,A wonderful Temple which is close to the COEX Center and which was really surprising to walk through. ItÂ´s a must to see.
71,5.0,"I wanted to spend some time in quiet place. My friend suggested Bongeun-sa Temple. The main temple was quite full of people but there many other smaller temples and meditation places where you can spent ""quiet time""."
72,4.0,this is really one of the highlights of a trip to Korea- take your time and if you are interested in history -take a guide or tour
73,5.0,"Directly opposite Seoul's new temple to business, shopping and gambling is this 1200 year old Buddhist temple.What's not to like - especially on Buddha's birthday!There's a giant Buddha staring across to the new city of Gangnam, there's beautiful temples, and a low key Buddhist gift shop as well.If you are keen, sign up for a temple stay!"
74,5.0,Beautifull and serene temple in the center of seoul. A must see in the gangnam area. Get out at Line 2 Samseong subway station and walk past COEX and youre there.
75,5.0,"Beautiful grounds, peaceful, a place that makes you realize you actually are on the other side of the world."
76,5.0,"Although situated in busy streets of Seoul, the temple offers peace when you enter. It is well connected by several buses making it easy to reach. There is a giant statue of Lord Buddha. The entire atmosphere is very calming."
77,5.0,This is a very beautiful temple in the heart of Seoul.It is very serene and a great contrast to the crowds and noise of Seoul. It is historically very significant and a joy to walk through and experience.
78,4.0,"Visited this temple twice as I was staying across the road from here. The first time was during their special afternoon prayer. Other than the main temple buildings there are a number of smaller mini-temples dotted around the site, also a big statue of budha. A good place to spend an hour or two."
79,5.0,Located just across the street from the COEX and Intercontinental Hotel. It is a place of peace and tranquility located in the heart of Gangnam area.
