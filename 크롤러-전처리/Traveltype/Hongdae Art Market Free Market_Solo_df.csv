0,3.0,"I came to the location after 1 PM that’s when the information said that it “opened” - but found ... a regular street of shops and stalls, and a few “buskers,” but certainly nothing that wasn’t open an hour before. I wandered pretty extensively, so I’m confident I was in the right place, but unimpressed for an “art market.” Fun to wander, but not as an art market."
1,4.0,"Lots of things happening here - plenty of atmosphere- buskers, great shops  food stalls and even nicer cafes (where you can actually sit!) Good prices here as it is in a university area and caters for kids with not a lot of money."
2,3.0,"I was expecting much more diversity in goods and designs when I read that there was an application to sell at the free market.  When I went, most were selling jewelry, some were selling leather goods, some textiles, some paper goods with original art.  some portrait drawing stalls. No food stalls inside the actual free market. There was one performer when I went. No one actually stood nor sat in front of him to listen to him play. I thought it was awkward that everyone was sitting on the brick ledges behind him.  Maybe move the performance area so that the performer has his back to the vendors and is facing people listening and set up some stools. (I had been looking forward to visiting the free market but it had rained the previous Saturday so I decided to wait for the sun. i am glad I did not go on a rainy day because it would not have been worth it for me.  The Hongdae area itself is worth a visit, just not only for this.   People that reviewed this seemed confused as to what the free market actually is.  The free market is held Saturday afternoons(1-6) at the small park near Honggik Uni. People called it the children’s park, but it seemed too small for a children’s park and there was nothing for children to play on... most people that reviewed this were reviewing the Hongdae area, not the free market itself."

4,5.0,"While this is the domain of the young don't let it put you off. Heaps of street food, students entertaining dance, music and acrobatics, interesting fashion particularly mobile phone accessories, it's a great day out to really feel the Seoul atmosphere. It's easy to get to as 3 metro lines service the precinct and anyway as they are mostly students English is easily understood. To me after going to the tourist populated Namdaemun and similar markets this is a great and better alternative."
5,3.0,One of the places where you need to visit when you're in Seoul. It has very nice atmosphere. Lots of youths are around this area. There were street performances by various groups of youth - from dance to singing. Lots of things to see!
6,4.0,"This Saturday free market brings together the crafts of designers young and old and i enjoyed my time just strolling and checking out the stuff available. It is quite a small market so not much time has to be dedicated . As this is right in the midst of the hongdae shopping district, you can just hop over after the free market and continue the shopping."
7,4.0,"Trendy fun place to chill and walk around.  Crowded with hipsters and tourists, it's a nice cool place to munch on the delicious night market snacks and soak in the ambience around the area."
8,4.0,"I only visited at night and there were full of bars, pubs, cafe, restaurants, Karaoke, retails shops etc. The live performance was amazing and managed to get quite a good crowd. If you are after some places to hangout or some entertainment till late - you can always check out Hongdae."
9,3.0,"Went there on a Sat.  Take Hongik Univ subway (line 2) , exit 9, its opposite to the Hongik Univ. Its a relatively small market with 30 odd stores setup selling mostly accessory for girls age 16-25. I think most are hand made items. Nothing much interesting for male audience. In terms of food, there are plenty of choice around that area, you just need to explore a bit. Overall, since its an university area, its quite lively. Its worth spending 2-3 hours just to walk around and absorb the atmosphere"
