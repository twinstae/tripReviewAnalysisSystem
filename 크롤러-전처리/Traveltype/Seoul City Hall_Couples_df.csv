0,3.0,"The new Seoul City Hall is, indeed, an interesting architectural structure -- but if one's time is short when visiting Seoul, a visit inside is not required."
1,5.0,We did not get a chance to go there for long but our hotel was right next to the City Hall square so we passed by quiet often. The buildings are impressive and we liked the vibe overall. Definitely worth a stop - esp when there are performances
2,5.0,Love this place so many thing you can do and good place to eat shopping and have a lot cute coffee shop ! To take MRT or Bus in Seoul very easy and fast very safe here I do love this city very much I come every year too
3,3.0,"Very unusual curved glass design.    I didn’t care for it at all.  Not from any direction.   The smaller former city hall, now a library, is immediately in front of the new City Hall,    There is a large grassy area in front which is used as an ice rink in the winter.    You can also take a picture sitting on, or in front of, the S E O U L lettered sculpture, facing the City Hall.     2 Metro stops 1 block away."
4,4.0,It’s worth taking a detour to walk past the new City Hall.  Which stands imposingly behind the old much smaller city hall.The architecture is extremely impressive and the curves are spectacular!Not much to do there apart from admire the building!
5,5.0,For the first timer travel to this city.. Starting from the first landing at Incheon... Clearing an immigration and custom.. Quite a procedural SOP which have to fulfil as most typical traveler like Asian kind.. Where have to take some of the groceries from local produce as a typical traveller would not survive with the food at the countries which they landed..some strict rules of food preparation by the landed state... Where it may prohibited to take them. No other way.. Bring some of the local ingredients and bring along some.. And declare at the customs what have you brought in.. List them.. And you are allowed to get in.. Accept for the past 2 visit.. Sydney and Auckland.. Where Auckland seek to see what you have brought in.. Go one by one... Seoul.. Know your culture well and the procedure seem look efficient... but unfortunately the counter for KAL Limousine to get to City Hall was close at 9.30 pm... My clearing at the airport at 10.39 pm.. having no choice.. Get a International Taxi... 65000 won at Region 2 of your destination.. Right in front of your lobby..Moving around City Hall.. advisable to move around with subway.. Get a T Money and load the amount of your required amount as the local at 7~11 suggested put a value of 10000 won for your usage as long as 3 days.. And also.. How often you move from one region to one region... Subway makes your mobility at Seoul.. Efficiently and do not hesitate to open your soft spoken skill to ask the station worker.. If you look lost....
6,5.0,"This building is a world class architectural building. Indoor planting is superb, walls of foliage. Marvellous forward thinking, Seoul is an architect's delight. Stunning buildings throughout this spotless city where planting and foliage profligate."
7,4.0,it is a bit surprising to see the glass building of the new city hall behind the old city hall at Seoul Plaza. Last time I visited Seoul it didn't exist.  City Hall area is consisted of several buildings worthwhile to see around the Seoul Plaza. This time Seoul Plaza seem to be a festival area during the Chuseok.  But there is Deoksugung Palce and related park.  Seoul Museum of Art is nearby.
8,5.0,"Unlike the Hadid building across town, this modern building is active, alive, and has heart.  From the greenery in the lobby, looking upward to the very weird orbs, this place screams fun.  In the basement was a very active space, with a fair, food area, and best of all, a really well done archeological dig that we really enjoyed.  We just walked away feeling good about this place."
9,4.0,"Very modern building close to the square, where you can enjoy free concerts in Summer, you can enter the building and have a walk on the ground floor, the top floors are for staff I think. The admission is free."
10,4.0,"Wow !!!  Who knew a municipal city building could be this visually stunning.  Impressive architecture.  Nice snack shop on top floor lets you sit and enjoy the views.  But, the secret wonder is the basement with its Gungisi relics.  You can walk over a glass floor and view the site.  Plus, there is a Korean Tourist desk located by the exhibition hall with very helpful staff."
11,4.0,If you are into your buildings then come marvel at this wonderful and unique design. The green square makes a great foreground for photos. Close to D palace.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
12,4.0,The seat of power of the metropolitan city of Seoul! You can't miss this building when you are in the city centre. Its imposing architecture lords over the surrounding building in the Seoul Plaza. The building looks stunning from whichever angle that you are admiring this building from.
13,5.0,A most beautiful building arcitecture speaking.the building is a green planed and a visit in the building is a must.
14,3.0,Really not that much to see. The architecture is nice but not the most extraordinary I've ever seen.
15,4.0,Worth a look and walk around if you are in the area or staring your way to the Gwanghwamun Square. Pretty original architecture. There are a couple of flyers for a self-guided tour. The underground part is also nice with the fare trade shop and coffee place.
16,4.0,"Located right next to the previous City Hall building that makes up an interesting sight of the combination of modern and old. Very intriguing building in the heart of the city, suggesting that Seoul is ready to look forward even if it doesn't always materialize in daily life. I can't actually provide more information about their services but I definitely suggest checking out the building from inside out."
17,4.0,"Come to city hall to have a look at the ""Green Wall"" which is one of the largest vertical gardens in the world. Also there is a cafe at the top which we wanted to visit but is currently closed (will reopen later in year). Under the city hall you can see the excavations when building the wall and they discovered the footings of old houses."
18,3.0,"We had a early morning walk pass Seoul City Hall.It exhibits Korea's culture and all.There are shops selling souvenirs. Just outside the building, there are tents setup for ""rebel"" on Fri and Sat. Parts of the roads will be closed."
19,4.0,"The title just about covers it, worth stopping to look at whilst passing, but don't go out of your way."
20,3.0,"City Hall is the same wherever you are in the world.  It is an administration centre.  What's unique about this place is that the old building has been converted into a world-class public library, and that a brand new architectural building is being built adjacent to it.  At one stage, it has the world's tallest vertical garden but it still looks rather impressive.  There's a visitor's lift that takes you to the 8th floor where temporary art presentations are being held from time to time, and that you can walk up the stairs to the ninth floor, where there's a café, and where you can have coffee meetings with your colleagues overlooking the city of Seoul.  At the basement of the new City Hall is a small public stage free performance is being held there from time to time.  Overall, there's a sense of blandness about it.  Still, if you haven't been to Seoul before, you might want to see this for yourself.  Outside the Hall is a large field where a lot of huge of demonstrations are being held."
21,3.0,Interesting architecture and you pass it when you go to several sights around. Nothing special though.
22,4.0,"Good building to check out, if you catch it once per day you have a free english tour, but you can follow their proposal and do it yourself, the vertical garden inside is nice and the while building is very interesting.It is free attraction.Have a coffea on the 5 floor of the library as there is a very nice garden terrace with a great free view of the center."
23,3.0,"You could just as well look at a photo, nothing to do there, but look at the odd shaped building and hear the story of why it is that way. But, again, it's sort of obligatory, before you are liberated to just walk around an look at local shops and restaurants."
24,5.0,Discovered the vertical garden upon entry. It was fascinating to look at and there were gardeners pruning leaves. There was a food exhibit while we were there highlighting food waste in today's society which was a good reminder to not to discard food that is misshapen. We also went down the steps outside to make a small donation. The steps light up and play music as you walk on them to donate money to children paraplegics.
25,3.0,"Impressive area for buildings, festivals, entertainment and gardens, we spent a couple of hours wandering the area. It is a great starting point for a walk up to Gwanghwamun Square."
26,4.0,What a mix of old and new architecture. Both interior and exterior are worth seeing and photographing. Located right next to yet another palace in Seoul...
27,4.0,We had a few hours to spend so went to see the Seoul City Hall.  It is an amazing structure both inside and out.  The plant walls were astonishing and the wave formation of the entire building as it casts its shadow over the old city hall is striking.
28,3.0,"An usual building, and one you probably won't miss, as it's almost opposite Deoksugung  Palace.  There's a metro station underneath, so it's not difficult to find.Worth a photograph - I took two!"
29,4.0,"cheapest ice-skating I've know. 1000won/hr and this includes skates. Coming from a tropical country, this would be considered a large rink."
30,3.0,"Seoul City Hall (free entry) is located upon Seoul Plaza in the heart of the city.  Here you find two buildings, the old City Hall which now serves as the Seoul Metropolitan Library and the new and modern City Hall, which is of a contemporary design and structure built in 2012. In addition to seeing the unique architecture of the building, there is a self-guided tour of City Hall which includes a few interesting stops. First, you can see the tallest vertical garden in the world which spans seven stories up the inner wall of the City Hall building. The self-guided walk also takes you up to the 8th and 9th floor Sky Plaza and exhibition gallery. There are a couple of cafes in this area as well. You then descend into the lower levels of the building where you find building ruins known as the Gungisi Relics, an unexpected find at City Hall. Additionally, there is a design shop, more art space and open lounge area. There was a duet performing a few Korean tunes during the time of our visit. That was neat to watch for a few minutes.  Overall, we enjoyed our short visit to Seoul City Hall. This is not a major attraction but a neat place if you enjoy unique architecture and peculiar attractions like the vertical garden located here. Note: You can download the Seoul City Hall Self-Guided Tour map. It can be found through google search and is available as a PDF file. You can also find the the map in brochure form within the City Hall building."
31,3.0,"I don't think the City Hall is anything to seek out to see, however it is very central and is on the way to many sites worth seeing, and has its own Metro stop that serves as a good starting point for several worthy sites around it."
32,3.0,We visited this place because some recommended it. We tried to check whats at the 9th floor as it is recommended. You can only take one elevator going up. Unfortunately the art exhibit was not yet ready during our visit. We just passed by since its near the palace. Nice architecture but nothing special
33,4.0,You should definitely at least see it and get a picture when you're in the city. It's beautiful and very unique. It's very picturesque!
34,4.0,"Enjoyed walking around the architecture of this building, and the huge vertical garden. Small art gallery upstairs."
35,4.0,"the city hall got a new buildings with hangging garden inside, lovely. and we just enjoy from the lower ground to take some photo shot. there's an art and beautiful architecture. outside the buildings you will find soccer lap for demonstration area."
36,4.0,"lovely place, but summer days, bit hot...recommend winter time"
37,4.0,"While the building itself was not open to the public while we visited the area, the architecture of the building is simply superb.The usage of glass (and I mean a LOT of glass) in the building gives it a somehow futuristic ""feel"", but certain elements bring it down back to a more classical style.Try to visit the place after dark, too, as the atmosphere of the building changes dramatically with the lack of sunlight."
38,3.0,"Went at the wrong time, it was a Korea national holiday, so this place was closed. We still had access inside which was fun and was able to see quite far out."
39,4.0,Amazing modern building in the heart of the city. I would say it incorporates we'll the spirit of this city and it inhabitants. Great photos.
