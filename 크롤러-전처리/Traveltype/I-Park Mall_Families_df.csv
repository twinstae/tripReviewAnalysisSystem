It is connected to the subway and train station so very convenient transportation wise. Here you can watch a movie at CGV or do some discounted shopping at EMART or eat and shop at the numerous other places. Most of the famous brands like Gap h&m Uniclo etc can be found here. In the middle open area there is always something going on.... in winter a skating rink and in summer a splash pool for kids. One of the coolest thing is a play area for kids located in the Yongpoon bookstore where you can drop them off for 2-3 hours while you do your thing or if very young, stay and play with them. There's also a large electronics section where you can find most things and everything is negotiable so good place to test your skills. Remember, another shop usually has the same product so be sure to shop around and haggle."

At the end of it, you'll find a nice korean restaurant. Compared to the other restaurants, this one is slightly cheaper. The toilets in the mall are very clean clean."

For muslim halal food we had to go to Eid restaurant (v.good) in itaewon but this took long time to get back."
