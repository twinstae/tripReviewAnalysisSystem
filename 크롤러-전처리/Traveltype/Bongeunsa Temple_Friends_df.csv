0,5.0,"Although, due to Corona Virus, the temple grounds were almost empty, I came here for some inner peace and inspirations. This is one of my top three favorite temples in Seoul and I come here a lot - during all the seasons. This time, it was quiet and almost ghostly - like most of the area on the day I went. But I found it beautiful and meaningful and I did enjoy my stroll around. The temple grounds are just opposite of Coex and offer a perfect comparison of the old, and traditional to the new surrounding buildings. Not a place to miss when visiting Seoul."
1,5.0,Beautiful temple that has a lot to explore. Little bit of uphill walking involved but it was great to see.
2,5.0,A very calming and serene temple to visit. The temple was lit up with hundreds of white lantern that made it even more calming. The lotus flowers added to the aesthetic. We went a little late in the day but it looked like they had a nice hiking area which I am sure would be great to check out. I recommend going in the afternoon.
3,4.0,"Although hardly a must see, this temple is a true oasis of tranquility and peace amidst busy streets of Gangnam. If you happen to be nearby don’t miss your chance to spend some time here."
4,5.0,"The grounds were peaceful and beautiful. There was monks chanting during our exploring. There was also some construction going on. The tea was delicious.  There are a few templestay programs that are offered. You can visit most areas as long as you are quiet and respectful. It was well worth the visit. Even though many of it was newer and lots of concrete I find it didnt distract from the overall beauty. It was in the heart of a,war 60 years ago. Not being completely origonal is accetable to me. Since for many it is still a place of worship new construction also makes sense."
5,4.0,The cherry blossoms were in full bloom when we went so it was picturesque. The colorful lanterns were both beautiful and touching because they all signified heartfelt prayers. It's right across Starfield Coex Mall.
6,5.0,"I always visit Bongeunsa as it is near my house, and I like the peaceful vibe I get when visiting. Even though it is in the middle of the city, I feel like you can get away from the city just going to Bongeunsa. It looks pretty these days with the blossoms too. But go quick, before it’s too late. I went two weeks ago, and though there were not too many blossoms yet, it was beautiful. They have also opened up a cafe, which I enjoyed having traditional omija tea (my favorite) and a Korean cookie."
7,5.0,Not a huge temple but a gorgeous one in the middle of city life! Wonderful old sculptures- my favorite Buddha loves here!
8,4.0,We visited this Buddhist temple while in Seoul. It took us about one hour to stroll through the various pavilions of the temple and to see the majestic Buddha statue. Interesting for those interesting in getting a glimpse of Korean Buddhism and those wishing to meditate.
9,4.0,A very nice and old temple in the heart of Seoul. The entrance is free but you will be charged if you park there. The contrast between these very old temples and the new city is impressive.You will need about 30m to 1h to visit the place
10,4.0,Amongst the hustle and bustle of gangnam sits this little piece of tranquility with fruitful quince and persimmon trees. A worthwhile visit. They also opened a tea house with views of the main garden.
11,5.0,"This is the bigest temple of seoul but is wonderfull. i loved visit tempels, every temple is special in it's own way but this was my favorite in Seoul"
12,4.0,"Usually temples are located outside of the city because they should be moved from the capital a long time ago. However, this temple is in the middle of Gangnam. You can be reached by a subway! and you can go to Coex mall after a temple visit."
13,4.0,"The temple is a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the Seoul metropolis although it’s situated just opposite the COEX mall. It is easily accessible via metro (Bongeunsa station on line 9), just a 3-minute walk from the station. The temple complex is beautiful and has a lot of history to it. The best views are at the top after all the stairs (be ready for some climbing!) Entrance is free so do check it out if you are in the region (Starfield Library in the COEX mall is worth a visit too after visiting the temple)."
14,5.0,"We were lucky we got a local lady who offered to tell us the background and history of this place . The temples were magnificent in their construction and attention to detail, we were lucky to also here ceremonies being carried out. The restoration project is in the pipeline for this place and least to say it will be impressive. The greatest vista was high up but more so the contrast of the temple roof to the highest rise scrapers behind"
15,4.0,Nice temple with some pretty buildings.  Easy to get to and walk around.  Takes about 40 minutes to see everything.  Worth a visit if you are in the area.
16,4.0,A great place to visit.  Amazing how such a quiet and peaceful place has remained in the middle of a busy city.  Won’t take long to walk around but really worth a visit.
17,4.0,Great for photos of the Buddha and the view. Easy to get to from subway. Lots of stairs but worth it. It's FREE so i recommend going there during the week.
18,5.0,While looking round Seoul we happened upon the Temple which is near the Rodeo Drive of Seoul. It was very nice. Fun and scenic to walk around. It was cold because of winter but very worth the visit. There is a mall just across the street also.
19,5.0,"Despite ongoing construction and being in city centre, I really enjoyed time spent in the temple. It is really peaceful and special. Has several buildings, as well as big buddha outside. Highly recommend to visit"
20,5.0,This Temple has a magnificently calm atmosphere even though it is located in the center of modern Samsung-Dong district. Nice traditional buildings and beautiful Buddhist sculptures. I was so relaxed here and got a charge of positive energy. Highly recommend it!
21,4.0,In the middle of town the temples are a must see if going through Seoul and without time to get out. Entry is free and you can freely wonder around taking photos.
22,5.0,"It's a large temple next to the coex mall. Lots of locals were visiting to offer prayers in the evening, the time we visited.  Please do respect them. There is a small souvenir shop at the premises with a decent collecting. The shop staff told it's open 365 days."
23,5.0,"Korea temples are known for their architecture and tinge of the ancient feel. This temple is no exception. Situated at Bongeunsa Temple Station (Seoul Subway Line 9), Exit 1 - it is very accessible. There's a little shop near the entrance, vegetarians can purchase some vegetarian beverages and dried foodstuff too."
24,5.0,Located right across the Coex Mall in Gangnam. Lovely place decorated with colorful lanterns.  It was a beautiful sunny day as we walked around the temple grounds.
25,5.0,"This is a very quiet, beautiful and relaxing place to visit.  I highly enjoyed walking there with friends"
26,5.0,"We went into the temple when it was already dark out,it must have been 19.00 or close to it so that's the time I'm recommending you show up as it felt like just the right time to be there. There was the sound of prayers echoing throughout the grounds and we sat by the enormous statue at the very back of the temple. The light along the walls reflected on the marble floor and made it look like water and the drifting sounds of the chants made for one of the best experiences I had in Seoul. I just wish people (tourists) were more respectful! It clearly said no photos all throughout the temple however some people had their cameras right in front of people that were praying,"
27,5.0,"This was one of my favorite places to visit.  The palaces in Seoul are interesting but the temple was more so because it is a working temple.  The grounds were alive with monks and worshippers.  You can hear monks chanting and see people prostrating to the large Buddha towards the back of the grounds and in the main worship area.  I was there a few days before the national college entrance exams and there were many visitors to the temple.  There was an energy to the place, but it was also very peaceful."
28,4.0,"Bongeunsa is a beautiful temple area which is literally across the street from COEX Mall. You can get there by car taxi or subway(any station near COEX) Thankfully it's not on a mountain as many Korean temples are. There main building has some beautiful features inside including religious statues. There are a number of buildings around the complex and I have no idea/don't remember what they were for but they were architecturally similar to just about every temple in Korea. Frankly, with the exception of a few, most temples in Korea look exactly the same. This one is surrounded by skyscrapers and the largest indoor mall in Asia. As a resident of the area it's a peaceful escape.  There is a huge buddha statue towards the back and many historic and architectural features around the complex. Please keep in mind, you'll be on temple grounds, be respectful and quiet. You can go nuts with your camera. There are some temple activities like temple stay but I have no interest in those so can't comment. There are many places to eat nearby especially in the mall. I personally like to go to Brooklyn Burger, which is a few blocks away, for some of the best burgers in Seoul. I highly recommend a visit if you're in the area. However, if you've already been to some Korean temples and you're short on time...meh reconsider. One last thing, avoid going on weekends and holidays if possible."
29,4.0,"This temple, coincidentally and conveniently located very close to the COEX, is a great place to visit and see an ancient Korean temple."
30,5.0,Very peaceful place to be. English guides and tours are available. Free entrance too. In the middle of Gangnam
31,4.0,"hopped a cab based on a TripAdvisor recommendation and was not disappointed. wandered around for a few hours, easily. the grounds are kept beautifully. quiet, serene, not overcome with tourists (at least not on the day I visited) a gem in the heart of Seoul."
32,5.0,"When you are in the Gangnam Area this temple is a must see. It got some nice buildings and statues. Do remember that this is a holy site for the locals so be respectful when visiting. Combine it with other events in the Gangnam district. for example go to the Olympic park first, then Coex mall, then this temple"
33,5.0,"Not much to say - way worth the ride to gangam. Go in the morning hours to see the chants, or better yet -- do a temple-stay! it's amazing."
34,4.0,"Came here on a rainy day, beautiful temples. In the center there are 4 huge bells to call all four directions. A huge statue of the future Buddha stands within a large circle outdoors. They have a lovely shop with all sorts of souvenirs & Buddhist supplies including clothing."
35,5.0,"Bongeunsa is by far my favorite temple Seoul. It's located just across the street from COEX Mall near Gangnam. I've been there multiple times over my 8 years here in Korea because it's just so beautiful. After the renovation of the grounds they did a few years back, it's even better than before."
36,4.0,Such a beautiful temple. It is a lot bigger than what I was expecting. It was super hot to walk around though as there is little shade. But genuinely beautiful and an information sheet on it in English!
37,4.0,The temple wasn't as large as I expected but it still had plenty to see for 1-2 hours. It is not that peaceful as it is located right next to a busy street and has a parking lot full of cars and buses but is still beautiful.The area consists of a few larger buildings and many smaller houses. Remember to respect the locals as it is a religious place.
38,4.0,"It is a temple that is situated atop a hill and you could get a nice view of Seoul from here, especially at night. A nice place to visit as it is quiet and calm."
39,5.0,"i was born and raised in korea, but never really thought about visiting touristy places until my friends came to visit... most were just boring or just similar to a lot of the places i went to as a child on school trips, but bongeunsa -- this place is a must. i went three times in the last four months taking different friends there, and it was a new experience every time. they have different themes -- for example, there were white lanterns in every corner of the temple when i first visited and the second time there were beautiful Chrysanthemums everywhere to celebrate fall. if you're staying in seoul, bongeunsa is very very easy to get to on the subway and i highly recommend taking the time out to see it!"
40,5.0,"Walking from both 2 nearby MRTs to the temple is not closed at all. Line 2 station will need to cross COEX mall whereas Line 7 will need to climb up & down a hill). But once you reach to the temple's door, all tiredness will disappear. Local people buy rice, red beans, candle & flowers to bring in the temple. If you're tourists, just quietly pay a visit inside the main temple & surrounding. Spring & Fall are 2 best seasons to visit. Look at the lanterns hanging up on the ceiling, pretty nice ones."
41,5.0,The temple itself is so big! The shrine is really colorful and they have this huge sculpture of Buddha in the back. You can actually feel that solemnity whenever you step inside the temple. They also have this souvenir shop in the entrance where you can buy different charms and books.
42,4.0,Located around coex mall. A traditional landmark in seoul district! Not very big temple but is well maintain (:
43,5.0,"The Temple and the grounds are beautiful and give a instant calming effect. There are many buildings to see so give yourself plenty of time.  Once inside, it's incredibly quiet even though there is a very busy street and traffic outside.  Make sure you look all around.  There is beauty everywhere.  Please be mindful while touring the grounds of the people in prayer inside of the different buildings.  If going the the COEX mall, try to visit this Temple.  It's nicely tucked away off the street and worth a visit.  You'll be glad you did.  There are a couple of gift shops as well."
44,5.0,This temple is exactly opposite the COEX and is very easy to visit. There's no fees so you can spend your time in this tranquil location. We came at a time when there was a kimchi making event which was pure bonus.
45,5.0,"Firstly I was blown away to find a beautiful 1200 year old temple nestled in the midst of a concrete jungle ! I love this temple more than Jogyesa as I found it more soothing to my soul hearing the monks chanting, the many small temples in the same grounds allows you some quiet and solitude if you just want to sit still and absorb the vibrations of the place. Definitely a place to visit and don't forget to do lunch at their hall where they serve everyone..rich,poor.destitute for KRW 1000. Simple food but i found it satisfying"
46,5.0,Was attending a congress at the COEX and popped across the road to this temple one afternoon. Lovely buildings and gardens. Very relaxing and tranquil couple of hours. Pleased I popped in on the spur of a moment. Left with a peaceful feeling.
47,5.0,"The big steps and Red doors to greet you area spectacular, The multiple prayer temples and surrounding grounds are an amazing sight. This was worth the trip to see a historic sight in korea."
48,4.0,"This temple in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, is a complex of several buildings and shrines on a hillside which can be explored in any order. It is free to get in and a very peaceful place to visit. It goes without saying that tourists, though they are welcome, are not actually allowed into the temples where worshippers are constantly praying. The interior can be observed from the outside. It is close to a subway station."
49,5.0,This temple is absolutely beautiful. You wouldn't guess it's as big as it really is by looking at it from the street. Definitely worth the trip. It's very different from temples in other Asian countries.
50,5.0,"This temple has so much to offer to the tourist-- beautiful buildings and grounds, a changing of the guards ceremony and several museums around the edge."
51,5.0,"A serene temple iin Seoul, the Bogeunsa Temple offered me an insight into a Buddhist Temple in Seoul. I feel that the temple has more of a ""Zen"" feel compared to most Chinese Buddhist Temples, it also has several huge statues behind the temple ground. Just outside the temple grounds, there is a relatively decent Vegetarian restaurant and shop, where the dishes are tasty and economically priced."
52,4.0,"This temple was built in 794. Beautiful structure and peaceful environment. Exit next to Coex Atlantic Hall, walk 50m to Coex Intercontinental Seoul. Cross the zebra crossing in front of the hotel."
53,5.0,Big buddha status is there to pray. Temple stay is available with reservation. Shopping mall and airport terminal is close by.
54,4.0,I went to Bongeunsa with a bunch of my mates from academy and we did the Temple Life program. First a guide took us around the temple grounds and explained things to us. Then we had really nice tea and talk with one of the monks. We also did paper lotus flower and meditating. It was really relaxing and i felt really at peace after. The stress was gone.
55,5.0,"if you love temple and pagodas you're on the right placeGreat place, an island of silence, a must in Seoul"
56,3.0,Im not a big fan of these sites but it was interesting to see. Lots of tourists..........keep your elbows up.
57,5.0,"It's amazing that such a haven of tranquility could have emerged in one of the most bustling districts of Seoul. Bongeunsa is something special, and it's very convenient if you don't have time to go further out of the city to visit a temple."
58,5.0,"This was my first tourist stop in Korea and I really liked it.We wandered around the various prayer rooms, many of which were in use, and entered a few to sit down and take in the atmosphere.The buildings are lovely and when we were there (July) they were putting up lots of lantterns, which made a nice sight.There is a little tea room - be sure to go into it.  The lovely lady there took us through making tea *properly* and it was a delightful experienceDefinitely worth visiting!"
59,5.0,it is such a beautiful place and right in front of Coex Mall...so have a walk in this beautiful place full of lanterns and stairs till you come down to see the huge budda and when you finish you can cross the street and get into a most modern mall of Seoul to have a lunch or dinner if you visit the temple on the evening.... must go . so beautiful.
60,5.0,"Directly opposite COEX, this is a beautiful and peaceful temple. Visited this temple on both my visits. Highly recommend it to all visitors."
61,5.0,"After spending time in both Japan and Korea, I can really say this was my favorite temple. Perhaps, my trip was enhanced by the fact that they were celebrating with lanterns everywhere. Each of the various rooms around the large temple had prayer sessions going on with relaxing rhythmic chanting. The lanterns lit at night with the backdrop of the city skyline was wonderful! Also the staff were walking around offering to take pictures. It was a wonderful, calming experience! I would recommend going in the evening!"
62,5.0,"The temple was fabulous where you can practice meditation. They also have a ""temple stay"" program where you can rejuvenate your soul and mind."
63,3.0,"Best time to go is close to Buddhas birthday because there are many colorful, pretty lanterns all over."
64,4.0,"This is a busy temple in the middle of the city, just opposite the Coex Korean Trade Center. I have been here a couple of times and it is a nice break from other sightseeing or shopping. There is a monumental statue of Kwan Yin facing which is a nice sheltered area where you can sit an meditate or just rest and contemplate. There are often other events happening. It is lovely to view the juxtaposition of ancient and modern in the skylines of the temple and surrounding post-modern buildings."
65,5.0,This place gave us a peaceful feeling when we visited it. Quiet and tranquil. We would love to be back.
66,4.0,Majestic temple is nearly lost between city buildings. Temple is very colourful and also there is a nice park nearby.
67,4.0,"Beautiful buildings, a nice place to walk and stop in for a prayer. Sadly they had construction under-way but nothing too much. Enjoyed the tea shop and gift shop for Omija tea and prayer bead bracelets. Wish I could have enjoyed a templelife of templestay program but unfortunately I was too last minute to book. Heads up its a two hour tour on Thursdays only or a two day stay unsure what days exactly. A good place to check out. And coex is across the street so you can kill two birds with one stone on the trip !"
68,5.0,"I absolutely loved Bongeunsa Temple. It was my first time there; though I have been in the area before. I love this little peaceful oasis in the midst of modernity. I love the Temple grounds and looking through them seeing all the modern skyscrapers. I also went during the fall, and this place was especially enchanting with colorful foliage. I will return for sure and would definitely recommend this temple."
69,4.0,"The setting and the surrounding of the temple is sure odd with high rise buildings towering over it but inside the temple premises, the ambiance is peaceful and tranquil and as the others have mentioned the best time to visit the temple is definitely the night as the lightings and the ritual ceremonies all just exhilarates the whole experience and the beauty of the place."
70,3.0,The temple is in a very strange location if you see all the surroundings. But then again the Temple was there first :)The temple is very nice and the architecture is just stunning... You will get many an opportunity for nice photos...
71,5.0,"Getting here from my hostel in Hongdae took about one hour, but it was definitely worth the trip. The temple itself is impressive both architecturally and because it is still in use. Having lived in Jeju for the past three months, it was truly a breath of fresh air to have a tourist pamphlet for the temple of good quality in English. Temple stays are offered here, and although I've yet to partake in one, I would definitely come back to do so. Other tourists attractions within walking distance include the underground COEX mall and the Seolleung tombs."
72,4.0,"Visiting Bonguensa Temple makes you feel that you've gone back in time.  And then you realize that at the background above the temple, you find the modern high rise buildings :-)  It's actually a very nice attraction and you feel relaxed being here despite this temple being in the middle of a modern city.  It's very spacious and serene.  And it's a active temple where many locals visit.The temple offers a live in experience too, which seemed interesting and probably something nice to do if one has the time.  We just visited for the afternoon though.  We spend a few hours there just sitting and enjoying the scenery and the irony of the old and new structures and I also had a great time taking photos of the contrasting ambiance.The place is very well kept and maintained.  The gardens were made lively by the colorful flowers."
73,4.0,"Visited on a cool morning. Chants were heard as we approached the grounds. When walking within temple grounds, one is filled with a sense of peace and serenity.The big statue of Buddha is a magnificent sight to behold. It was interesting to look back at the city area from the high grounds of the temple. There are some paintings on the outer walls that seemed to depict stories. Also look out for the Hanging Board in Panjeon Hall."
74,4.0,"Bongeunsa is a very nice temple, with quite a few individual buildings making up the entire temple ""complex"". As far as temple go, I'm sure there are more impressive ones elsewhere in Korea, but this it's pretty nice nonetheless. What makes this place truly amazing is that once you start getting deeper into the hill and the temple, everything gets quieter, and you might even get to see monks meditating or performing rituals. And then, you turn around and get to see Gangnam skyscrapers and gigantic malls in the same line of vision as the temple. The contrast is absolutely amazing, and few other cities allow you to visualize in one picture this mix of tradition and frenetic modernity. Best enjoyed during rush hour when this contrast is greater."
75,3.0,"Nice, cool to see...but damn another Temple.  I guess if you are there like us...you should see this Temple but a little anti-climatic for us....oh well!!"
76,5.0,"What a delight to be walking around Gangnam and then come across this temple, the statues are all beautiful and you can really take in all the suroundings.Easy to get to and close to Aquariam. Make sure you visit this as it's something you'll never forget"
77,5.0,"Bongeunsa is a Buddhist temple located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu in Seoul. This is one of my favorites in S. Korea. The place is so quiet and beautiful notwithstanding it is located in the the heart of Gangnam, the financial district of Seoul.  There is a huge Buddha facing the city and from that view, you can see the panoramic view of the temple and high-rise buildings of Seoul.  This is a must see tourist destination is Seoul."
78,5.0,"I loved it... just take your time to admire the doors, the gates, and to walk behind the temple up to a very small hill to see the old roofs against the modern buildings.   Good place to meditate."
79,4.0,"The gates of this beautiful temple invite passersby to a place of quiet and calm. This is a ""living"" temple allowing visitors to witness or participate in Zen ceremonies. It even offers a 4-hour ""live like a monk"" option for those interested in a very small taste of what it is like to practice Zen Buddhism. There are many smaller shrines to visit, as well as a large granite statue. The artwork, the architecture and the grounds are beautiful. Well worth at least an hours time for the lasting sense of peace it imparts."
80,3.0,We didn't really get the full benefit of the place as it was undergoing renovations.  The entrance was impressive and we spent time taking pictures.
81,4.0,This is my first temple visit and it's amazing. It is located at the center.So. accessibility is easy.
82,3.0,"I have visited many different temples in Korea, and this was my least favorite. While all of them are commercialized to some extent, it is usually kept to a store on the premises. At this temple, you are greeted almost immediately by an ATM. Now, it is very beautiful, and a peaceful place in the middle of the crazy financial district of Gangnam, but I didn't feel the peace that I felt at many other temples across Korea. Yes, it is worth a visit, but if you feel a bit unsettled there, as I did, keep going as there are many other temples in Korea."
83,4.0,"Its basically a temple, not a must go but it is something different from the surrounding shopping district. Very peaceful environment."
84,5.0,"Bongeunsa is a Buddhist temple located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu and this was our first temple we saw in Seoul and we both loved it so muchThere are individual Temples around and each were filled with singing and had such a beautiful atmosphere around the whole complex and felt so peaceful in a huge cityThe Temple is different from the others around Seoul as there was a beautiful huge statue of the Buddha overlooking the modern buildings on the other side of the TempleIts a bit futher out from the main city centre area but it really is worth seeing"
85,4.0,"Beautiful temple a short walk from a subway station.  We toured this temple in the morning at a very active time around the time of the Budda's birthday, so almost all the rooms were in active use.  It was very interesting to see this and respectfully spend some time.  An amazing oasis within the heart of a modern bustling area of a large modern city.  A study in contrasts."
86,5.0,"Beautiful temple with Huge Buddha statue and beautiful trees. Very scenic and calm. Temple is well maintained and with lots of colorful lanterns! Location is great too. Very serene and peaceful. Love everything about the place, being a Buddhist myself, I felt a sense of peacefulness after the temple visit."
87,4.0,"My friends and I did the TempleLife program which is a 2-hour program to introduce and experience a bit of Buddhist life. It was raining heavily when we got to the temple, but surprisingly, the skies cleared up the moment for the entire duration of our tour. There were 10 total in the group we participated in so it was a good size The tour was very informative and interesting since I didn't know much about Buddhism and Buddhist temples. There are some interesting buildings in the temple such as a place where people pray if they want to have kids and another place popular with parents to go and pray so that their kids will do well on their school exams. Then afterwards we went to a building where we were able to watch the tea ceremony being done by 2 women. It would have been nicer if we were able to actually learn how to do the tea ceremony ourselves. We were served the tea and some snacks (dried burdock, dried potato, etc). Then we were taught how to make lotus flowers (out of pre-formed paper petals and cups). It wasn't much and I felt like I was rushed to finish mine since one of the ahjumma helpers took the initiative to help me put mine together. Then we went back to the room where we did the tea ceremony and learned how to do seon/zen meditation. It was facilitated by a female monk, which also whet my interest. The monk's elaboration on the meditation in the Q&A afterwards confused me a bit, probably due to the language barrier (or maybe I just don't know how to meditate period). But she was quite helpful in explaining more about the history of monks and Buddhism in Korea as well as her own experience as a female monk. I wish this portion was a bit longer though. The best part was definitely the tour and seeing all the buildings. There were interesting little statues and prayer rock stacks everywhere. I think a favorite part of mine was seeing the huge Buddha statue, a pretty amazing sight to me. The program can stand to be a tad cheaper (20,000krw), but my experience was pretty good. If I had the time, I would opt for the TempleStay program to live the Buddhist temple life for 2 nights (70,000krw). Note: My friends and I had the best ever patbingsoo (red bean iced dessert) at the temple cafe. It was simple but soooo good. Oh, the cafe/bookstore also has items created by the monks and healthy Buddhist-friendly foods."
88,5.0,A wonderful temple just opposite Coex mall. The place is quite and picturesque. You can go inside the prayer hall and spend time over there. The hall is very colorful and vibrant becoz of the beautiful lanterns on the ceiling. The outside of the temple is very green and fresh. Its easy to go to this temple by subway. Samseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 2) and take Exit 6.There is no entry fee.
89,4.0,"This temple is lovely. It seems so strange to have such a place right across the street from COEX. Definitely go post-shopping to unwind, look are beautiful art, and admire the architecture. Don't forget to stop by the gift shop to check out the incense selection! If you can, try to go to the temple in May during the celebrations for Buddha's birthday. There is a multitude of paper lanterns in all shapes and sizes. Gorgeous. Check their calendar as there will be some events worth attending, as well"
90,3.0,Temple is very quiet and peaceful. Opposite COEX but you won't feel any sounds of traffic. You will feel calm and peace :)
91,5.0,"I went in the evening which is probably the best time of the day to go there. The colours from the temple and skyline make photos look impressive!There was some kind of ritual going on when i arrived which was really good to see.Defo worth going, probably will take you around one hour to see it all."
92,4.0,This temple was impressive and very relaxed.  I went around Buddha's Birthday so it looked extra special.  It is really interesting that it is surrounded by city and yet from within the temple it is so quiet and peaceful.
93,5.0,"I had a good time in Seoul before. My friend, Lee take me to many beautiful place there. But the most memorable place was this Buddhist temple. It had a typical Korean architectural style, large and beautiful. It was very solemn and ancient. It make me feel relaxed and it seems like I can feel the inner peace myself . I spent the whole afternoon there and it was worthy. I think this is a good destination in Seoul for everyone."
94,4.0,Beautiful sculpture of Buddha in stone. There is a peaceful and calming effect when you step into the praying hall.
95,4.0,"Love the serenity I felt in this temple. It'll take about 1.5 hour to finish touring the entire temple, longer if you pause and take photos which I did. Take time to go around and enjoy the architecture which is a sharp contrast from all the high-rise modern buildings surrounding the temple."

97,5.0,"I really like this temple.  Very peaceful and lots to see, but all within easy access from the city.  Actually it's right beside the Coex mall, so you can do both in one day.  The temple is very peaceful and has a huge Budha statue at the back.  I like to go here at night or at dusk when all is quiety and you can really feel a sense of peacefulness.  You will often see monks walking around here at all times of day."

99,5.0,"Nestled in the burst of skyscrapers in a dynamic Seoul, Bonguesa Temple features a totally contrary sense of calm, grace and nostalgia. Boasting colorful Buddhist style constructions, prayer halls and arrays of lanterns, the temple is well known for its enormous standing Buddha statue being positioned in the backyard and observing the opposite skyline of financial downtown. For a fully amazing experience at the temple, you can register the temple stay program at the temple or simply hop on a metro to make a short trip there."
