3,5.0,Samcheondong is a must visit if you are in Seoul simply because it combines a scenic stroll to Seoul's lovely hanok houses with retail and gourmet therapy.Don't forget to visit the countless unique cafes and restaurants situated along the road.
4,5.0,"This is located at Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 1. Along this small alley, you see some familiar scenes from Goblin drama. This is also near Pungmoon High School and Choong Ang High School where you can reminisce the drama :)"
5,5.0,Love this unique street full of Korean traditional cafe and restaurants and also western ones as well. There are tiny shops lined up as well and you can take any of the side streets to enter a labyrinth of Korean traditional streets full of charm and culture. Will be back.
6,5.0,Great neighborhood close to the Folk Museum and the main Palaces. Some shopping around as well. Great for tourists
7,5.0,"had a great walk around this road, definitely loving the ambience. this area is packed with cute and very artsy little shop, perfect for morning or evening walk. i regretted visiting this area only once, definitely going to this place again if i'm going to seoul!"
8,4.0,This area is a nice counterpoint to the Bukchon Hanok area that's nearby. This place is interesting and even a little edgy. There are many small shops selling interesting things. There are also cafes to stop by at and just be.
9,4.0,"I love visiting Samcheongdong! I always make time to visit this area since there are so many cute boutique shops. However, it's not cheap but some are affordable if you look closely. The area is fun to look around since it's a mixture of modern and antique buildings. There are many cute cafes to get some dessert and popular restaurants. It has become more popular with tourists so it can get crowded at times so don't go when it's too busy. This area can be a bit boring for kids and there are boutiques that have delicate items so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are traveling with children."
10,4.0,"I wandered here after visiting Gyeongbokgung Place and the National Folk Museum of Korea. Definitely like this place more than Insadong (a lot more commercialised). The street is known to be a café street with lots of hanoks converted into hip café joints. I was definitely hungry by the time I arrived this area. It was a toss between a late lunch or early tea at the café. My first stop was at The Restaurant. Then I realised it was too late for lunch, as the main restaurant will only start operations at 6pm. They run a café downstairs. The afternoon tea set menu didn't quite appeal......So I left & walked onto the main drag......Lo & behold : I saw Isaac, the famous sandwich chain. Takeaway sandwich for lunch in early winter? No way. I was fortuitous enough to spot the pop-up Bukchon Information Center. By now, I could eat an elephant. A warm hearty Korean meal. And it has to be a short walking distance. Ended at Cheongsujeong (House #91, 5 mins away). It sweetened my visit. After the meal, it was fun to walk around, scaled the steps to go closer to the hanoks and have an ariel view. Also ended up at Samcheong Park to watch the sunset. On the way back from the park, I stopped by a makeshift stall in the area, selling Bungeoppang 붕어빵 (crispy fish-shaped bread with red bean filling)....it was soooo gooooood!!"
11,5.0,"Samcheongdong-gil Road with cafe, galleries, shopping is close to Bukchon so remember to plan going here together. This place is a few minutes walk from Insa-dong. Many here are boutiques and each store carry their own unique styles: vintage, retro, hippie, romantic, classic chic. If you're a Running Man fan, you might want to come here. Highly recommended to come by and spend a few hours here !!"
12,5.0,I came here because i want to take picture like Running Man when the shoot full episode in this neighborhood. Generally really love this road that full of restaurant and small shops. So peaceful!
13,3.0,"A lovely walk in the neighborhood, with cafes, galleries, small little restaurants. It is more upscale neighbourhood. We walked from Cheng Dae Moon to Samheongdong to Buchon village. Nice interesting stroll, worthwhile visit. Be sure to stop at the coffee and traditional Korean tea houses."
14,5.0,"A very chill and artistic place. A lot of great boutiques, cafes and restaurants. Had a great time walking around exploring the area. Went here after venturing Bukchon Hanok Village."
15,5.0,"I can spent the full afternoon walking this place and still do not feel bored. Each time I. Am in Seoul for vacation, irregardless which season I will visit this place. This time round I wonder even further to each lanes and visit more shops than ever. It is an artistic place for me to relax. Eating and walking looking at the shops display, visiting the art galleries, having desserts stop, wondering into the skin care and cosmetic shops, checking out the shoes and hand bags design, looking at rental Hanbok shops. This is not really a place for K pop teens but if you want really good scenery, come around nov. this September is still hot at 28-26 degree in the day."
16,4.0,"Plenty of restaurants and shops around here. The atmosphere is really relaxing and less crowded. Enjoy your time here. The place is close to Bukchon so remember to plan going here together! If you're a runningman fan, you might want to come check it out since they came for one of the episodes!"
17,5.0,"A very nice place to visit. it just a walking distance with bukchon hanok village. Love the design of every single coffee sop, restaurant here. We able to eat waffle, churros and green tea patbingsu here. Delicious!"
18,3.0,"This is the one of our check point of our Seoul trip. Come out at Exit 1 Anguk station. We came here for the famous cheese noodles. On the way to the restaurant, you can see a wall painted ""We are young"". Well, this is one of the photo shoot point. Then, pass through the road, there are many small boutiques selling hand-made products where those are cute. But some of the products can be found in other shopping area which might be cheaper.Many cafes are aside and you can go any cafe there. It's the best way to calm down your mode and enjoy the relaxing moment here."
19,5.0,"Not a lot of people come here and i wonder why. It is very underrated as there are a lot of things to do here. Browse for artistic gems or mostly have fun by eating food, ice cream and dessert. Since this place is not overrun by people but at the same time doesnt look deserted, i very much recommend people to come here. This place is near Insadong (too overrun) and Jongno 3ga as well as the palace"
20,4.0,"Take a cab, the subway is too far to walk and we got lost on the first day trying to find the street.  Found it by accident.   its pretty, have lots of nice small shops to look at.  Was told that there is a street that sells lots of shoes, but we didnt have time.  Look out for the guys or gals wearing the red vest, they are the mobile tourist reps whom you can check with if you need help.  Have your lunch or brunch before you hike up the stone stairways that connects to Buchon Hanok Village.  A nice place to spend a quiet morning or afternoon."
21,5.0,"Samcheongdong-gil Road is one of my favorite streets to walk down in Seoul. The street is filled with such interesting shops and beautiful architecture that you can really just enjoy getting lost exploring the little shops and corners of every street and intersection. The cafes and restaurants are also good here! There are italian restaurants/international eats in traditional hanok style buildings, and also good traditional korean food places here! I would recommend taking a stroll through Samcheongdong to anyone visiting Seoul... I have yet to meet someone that didn't enjoy their time there."
22,5.0,"Each tea house has different special flavor & it will take quite a lot of time to visit them all. We kinda lost the way after climbing down from Buchon village & ""accidently"" got in the neighborhood. So our afternoon turned into tea session, which was greatly unplanned experience."
23,5.0,I never know that there are many different types of cafes. It is quite similar to Itaewon but small scale. A lot of good food there. :)
24,5.0,"located near by the main palace, bukchon hanok village and Insadong this is a lovely area of shops, cafes and restaurants.Great place to take pictures around in the warmer months and catch a cup of coffee or small bite to eat."
25,5.0,most of the traditional buildings here has been modified into cafes and restaurants. you can enjoy the ambience of modern living in a traditionally decorated buildings here in samcheondong.
26,5.0,Best to come here while planning to visit the national museums and bukchon hanok village. Lots of great cafes w/ just the right ambience to chill. I'd like to come back more than once!
27,5.0,"This road, authentic yet so lively. There are cafes, restaurants, dessert houses scattered around this area. I recommend you to taste tteokbboki in samcheongdong named moksuidona 목쉬돈나. It is so famous and already reviewd globally by the food blogger around the world. You could find street musician along the street. Some murals 'we are young'. Florist at the intersection is my favorite, the smell and bunch of flowers just blew my mind away. Near from this area you could easily reach gyeongbokgung palace and national museum. It is a really nice time to chill after visiting that tourism places. I came around here already 10 times, and i still enjoyed every momment of it, flowing thru the narrow roads and wondering which coffee shop that offered you cozy place and make nice memories."
28,5.0,Lovely place with great snacks & restaurants. So many hipster shops & cafes. There are flea markets as you walk in. Great finds!

Lots of interesting things to see in this area and shopping is cheap. Socks, clothes, shoes, accessories, lifestyle products etc. Good place for photography too. Must try the deep fried cuttlefish here! The best in Seoul!"

32,3.0,"This is a trendy place where fashionable-looking people (possible Seoul-lites) flocking during the weekends, where rows of shops and trendy boutiques with cozy cafes on the second floor lined up along the road. Even when you're not into shopping, it is nice to just stroll around, people-watching while discovering interesting facades and street art."
33,4.0,"A street full of Cafes and Restaurants...And of course, shopping. However, I do not seems to appreciate the shopping at this area, instead the food here is good, been to a few restaurants here and the ambience cum food are good. Its a nice place to stroll on a evening before dinner time..."
