We went as a small group and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this as a solo activity because a selfie stick won‚Äôt work in here."
1,3.0,We went there when the place is undergoing renovation. So limited exposure. If you are choosing between trickeye and alive Museum. I will recommend trickeye museum.
2,3.0,"This was very average. I'm sure it's fine for kids, but nothing exciting or very interesting for adults. Plus, works were being done and half of it was closed off, so not ideal."
3,5.0,"This place is incredible! If Im being completely honest, I enjoyed it much more than Trick eye museum. I felt this place had WAY more options and more illusions to view and take photos with. As everyone says, NOT good for solo travelers as you need someone else taking your photos! Such cool illusions and I wish they had more of these places worldwide! Would definitely recommend to others."
4,4.0,"Came here with my husband. It was a fun and enjoyable experience in the Alive Museum. You can take pictures in different angles and it‚Äôll show as if you‚Äôre part of the painting. There are other ‚Äúadventures‚Äù in the museum like Poopoo World, the Dynamic Maze and Dark Room. We tried the Dynamic Maze and it was a bit tough for people who don‚Äôt have strong physical abilities. I‚Äôve seen kids go through the challenges though. It was tiring but a fun experience at the end."
5,4.0,"My husband and I recently visited here. We had a really great time. I myself am obsessed with Alice and Wonderland so I throughly enjoyed the ""Black wonderland"" exhibit. I'm not sure if it's permanent or not but it was very fun and interesting! The paintings were fantastic and there was a lot to look at. If you go early in the morning, there are often less people. It's also connected to the Dynamic Maze and across the street from 2 cat cafes (we didn't learn this until later and it could've saved a lot of time so hopefully this helps someone while planning!)"
6,5.0,First time in an alive museum. Awesome experience! We had a lot of fun! Quite an experience for foreigners
7,4.0,After going to many trickeye museums they become sort of monotonous.  This museum is slightly better than the original trickeye museum but was very cold due to lack of heating... I went on November 1...
8,5.0,"I had the chance to go in several same kind of museum in other countries and this one was by far the best, really realistic and a large choice ""alive pictures"", obviously you need someone to take you in photo so don't go alone !"
9,3.0,Not the most unique however still fun for half an hour. A cool place for some fun pictures. You'll still want to go to the Trick Eye museum after. Although the attached Dynamic Maze is pretty fun.
10,4.0,We were lucky enough to have visited the museum as it was not crowded. It was just us and another young family. It is not a must-see but it was something fun.
11,4.0,This museum is pretty good but not the best one in the city. It would be better if they would give you pointers or ideas on how to stand and where to take pictures for all of them. Cool but not the best one in the city
12,4.0,An interesting experience with all the tracks inside.Next to a local shopping zone with lot of foods and clothing forlocal shoppers..
13,4.0,We really enjoyed this museum! It's different from places I've been to before and great if you want to have a laugh. I think it is worth visiting once. However not all the scenes look very realistic after having taken a photo! But others really do.
14,2.0,"Before this I went to trick art which was set up well, the photos looked pretty realistic later. Here there are not as many things and everything looks fake on the photo later."
15,4.0,"Not a bad way to spend an hour or two if you like taking funny pictures! There were a few groups of school kids there on field trips when we went, but we didn't mind. It wasn't super busy, and it was a nice break from the heat outside."
16,4.0,"For direction illiterate people like us... It took us 2 hours to find this place!! So FYI... it's right there on the Insadong street. üò© This place was absolutely so much fun... a must see, must go!! It's very affordable... I think it was worth every penny.I would have rated it 5 star. .. but I felt a little mislead. The brochure that we got with the ticket types and prices had an ALL IN ONE package but foreigners are not allowed. I just felt that if we weren't allowed. .. It shouldn't be advertised. My mother is actually Korean... and even at that .. we weren't allowed. Was disappointing.  Other than that... It's very fun and creative.  With your own imagination. .. there's a lot you can do there. Don't forget your camera!!! :)"
17,4.0,"We visited this place during Lunar new year which was a mistake. The museum was extremely crowded. It took us a long time to get through all of the exhibits and we decided to skip some because of the time. They had a dark exhibit as well but it was in Korean, hope they put an english  version in too. This place is great, just wish we went when the crowd was smaller."
18,3.0,"You basically take selfies with different backdrops to make unique photos. Fun for a little while but gets quite repetitive, the exhibit doesn't offer much besides the standard take a picture with this image to make you look like you are in the picture. I felt like it need other exhibitions or something else to make the trip with it"
19,3.0,"The Alive Museum is basically a ""selfie gallery"" - you take pictures of yourself in front of various paintings. There's some use of perspective illusions, but nothing too amazing. The whole exhibit is only mildly amusing to begin with, but the crowds were a total buzzkill. For the majority of the gallery, there is literally NO place to walk without blocking somebody's photo, meaning a lot of your time is spent standing around waiting for the other tourists to move. Not really recommended."
