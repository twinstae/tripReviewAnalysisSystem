1,4.0,"Lotte World Tower is one of Korea's architectural crown jewels. The tower symbolizes the meeting of the modern with the traditional, nature and cutting edge technology, and the accomplishments of man. Lotte World Tower contains everything that is necessary for modern urban living."
2,5.0,That was a great visit..great for everything great for all ages...it has abit of everything for every age...need to bring my whole family...so pretty good for the...
3,5.0,"If using the train, go to the Jamsil Station. You can get to Lotte world without going outside, there is a connection underground. I have been to many amusement parks, and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides. They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them. After 4, it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time. No exaggeration."
4,5.0,Went with some friends to Lotte World and had a blast at the park! Made us feel like we were kids again! :)
5,1.0,"If you’re thinking of visiting this park - DON’T!Absolutely terrible theme park!! I was so excited before for this theme park as it kept appearing in Korean variety shows, but it is SO FAR OFF from my expectations now the only emotion i have left for it is pure disgust. This park is a completely waste of time - the rides are old, trashy and not very well maintained. We waited 120mins to go on a ride called ‘French Revolution’ but in return all we got was a massive headache from our heads banging on the seats, and spent 15mins recovering from that.A limited options of food and the taste is also not that great. The castle is extremely small, and here comes the worst attraction in the park - Ghost House. This attraction is such a joke, still left us traumatised. We waited an hour in line (when we still had hope for the park) for this horrendous attraction, and I felt my head was filled with crap after sitting down and basically watched a badly animated short-film when the protagonist - the cat, realised that he is not a real cat, but a ghost cat. Hence, even though we got there at approx 11am, we left at 4ish because we felt like we were ruining our mood by keep staying in the park despite the fact that we didn’t want to waste our money. And lastly, if you’ve been to Disneyland or Universal studios theme parks and you’re used to their standards, don’t waste your time and money at Lotte World. Seriously. There are a lot more other fun stuff to do in Seoul and Lotte is definitely not one of them."
6,4.0,"We decided to go to this park on a whim. Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park (in the world?). It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station. If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side. It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park. The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween. Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary. 5/5 spooks. Rules involved. Don't let go of the rope, no running, don't blind the actors. The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides. I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast. I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day. Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance. A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on. The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine. My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue. There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals. It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park. Some staff tell you to leave if you're a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you won't be let back into the park."
7,5.0,This was the best place to play indoor games. There are also variety outdoor games. The price was affordable
8,4.0,"Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations. I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience, there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well. Unfortunately, we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island (what they call the outdoor area) because they all closed once it started pouring. Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides. My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well. Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit, and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes. We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 50-60 minutes at a time. The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if I'm not mistaken, you still need to ""fight"" for certain ride slots. Do check that you aren't going on a public or school holiday in S. Korea and do avoid weekends. We went on a random Thursday - to our knowledge there were no holidays, but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers.Another tip - don't miss the Folk Museum! It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits."
9,2.0,Doubt there is any safety regulations here like most public access places. They  close the rides early outside and some inside. Carousel horses are about the only ride open til closing time. Few restrooms available like most Korean public places. Very few exits for fire safety like most public places in Korea.
10,4.0,"Went on a rainy day so was a bit disappointing cause the whole first floor was closed  (all the rides and the good stuff...) it's anyway nice inside,come as early as you can (very long lines are waiting for you xD) #couples"
11,1.0,"3 of the rides are closed, there is no show, snacks, water and ice cream are sold out. Average wait time for one of the available 3 rides is 1.5 hours plus. Dont come."
12,4.0,"Lotte World has its own charm. Its indoor attractions are worth-trying.  At the Magic Island,  we tried the Gyro Drop and it was fine.  Horror of Horrors...  The Horror House had a long line of people and we waited for almost an hour. We were given 3D glasses as we entered. The design of the viewing room was okay but when the show began,  I realized that it truly wasn't worth the wait. The poor content of the 3D show was disappointing.  I slept throughout the rest of the viewing time.  The effects were way below my expectations and the absence of a good story frustrated me no end. If only I could tell the people outside that they have to look for another attraction,  I could have done it so. Well,  the administrators of this theme park have to give this a quick response."
13,3.0,"We accidentally went the day after Children's Day, so there were lots of school groups. It was quite tricky to find our way to the right queues as we didn't know the name of the rides, or which floor they started on. Several rides had wait times of over 2 hours which we were not prepared to wait for."
14,2.0,"Too crowded. Had to queue 3 hours+ for one single outdoor ride. Way too many people and it was not enjoyable at all. Not recommended. Perhaps the indoor rides would take a shorter time but overall, not enjoyable at all."
15,5.0,"grabbed margaritas from Vatos urban tacos mallside bar in the underground Lotte world Shopping malls. We were margarita'd quickly and firmly. Regardless we managed to buy the tickets online at the gate, a huge saving. Sidestep to the one hour of ice skating where my friend ice skated well, his first time & I was speed skating in rental skates OMG so much margarita courage! hahaha having an amazing time. Actually we lost any idea of time but it was running out. Made our way to the foreign guest entrance for Lotte world which was challenging, yet we made it in. We lost things along the way some shopping a power bank....hahaha when we finally found the indoor French revolution rollercoaster there was a 70min estimated wait  ! ""then"" an angle appeared out of nowhere and vip`d us to the front of a queue with a magic pass. It was actual magic. Thank goodness ! Then an awesome 4D movie adventure Flyventure excellent We did see a lights parade & indoor fireworks during our chaotic cascade through this indoor entertainment shrine. All in all we miss-judge available time & missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell. Really it was very cool very wow !Arriving as late as we did the full price would not have been great value. So if your short on time or late or experiencing high times, this deal makes it really worthwhile."
16,3.0,The rides were honestly more suitable for teens or younger kids though it’s still a great place. The queue for the rides were really long and it took us almost 2 hours jusy to ride a ride in the cold. Would be fun to go but not a must go if you’re there
17,5.0,Shopping - supermarkets - market stores - restaurants - up market stores (clothing handbags  jewellery. Shoes. Perfumes. Sports ) plus latke Lotte stores both dudes of main road .Multiple children areas including ice rink and other children’s games areas
18,5.0,I had a lot of fun times in Lotte World. This place is my dream since I was a child. The moment I step my foot into this place I was so amazed by how big this indoor themewark were. There are shows that you can watch and it was so entertaining!
19,1.0,"Came here with my sister on a Wednesday and it was packed with students. No personal space during the line up, will most likely get bumped.  Waiting time were minimum 2 hours. What foreigners need to know is that they have a lotte world adventure apps where u can reserve 3 rides per person. We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots. Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride. It’s called the magic pass reservation. Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets! We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 3.5hours. The ride lasted less than a minute, and VR was working. Not the best experience. Never going again. You will see the longest queue in your life. Went there at 930am left at 8pm. Managed to get on 5 rides only. Not worth my time and money tbh. Should’ve went to Everland. People in their 20s should just go to Everland for more thrilling rides. This place can be skipped for sure."
20,3.0,"Was here with a couple of friends (all in our twenties). Whilst it was a cool place, I dont think I would go here if not on either a date or with kids. For me the best thing was just seeing the indoors theme park and looking at cool things. The lines for most rides are pretty long. And one of the few things we did was go on a balloon that goes around the theme park in the roof. Which was pretty cool, but not worth waiting 90 minutes with a korean yelling/singing into a speaker constantly for every group going on a new balloon. The part with the games and stuff was okay but not great."
21,4.0,"At first time I’m not expect too much for this place because I think they only have rides just for children and not that big enough. But, surprisingly this place is sure big enough and have various rides for adult. I like Atlantis and French Revolution. But, unfortunately Flume Ride was out of service when I came. I’m not a fan of challenging attraction so yeah I skipped for viking and gyro rides."
22,4.0,"Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package. Spent about 4 hours here, from 5pm to 9pm. Place was semi packed with mostly couple's and families. Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter.Most of the rides were mild as this is a family theme park. Do try the ice skating rink on the lowest floor and there are several food options around to choose from"
23,4.0,"Be prepared to wait in lines and you're fine. I visited during super hot August and the lining was horrible. However, the attractions are fun and different from the ones I've been in other countries. I highly recommend the indoor roller coaster, Comet express, and Atlantis Adventure roller coaster. Just the indoor park itself is a sight to see. Go early in the morning if you want to experience everything."
24,4.0,"Like a kid in a candy store, there are so many things to see and wanna try and ride. The 'hot air balloon' was amazing. There are performances slotted. You need to check with the Information.Lots of eating places and snack bars too.The attraction outside is simply crowded. If you can endure the cold weather, it is kind of nice. But i expected it to be bigger."
25,1.0,"Because of the weather the ride numbers are very reduced, leaving you with not much to do and very very long lines. Do not visit here in winter wait for the warm weather"
26,5.0,I went to Lotte World in October 2018. They have a wide selection of games and activities as well as different restaurants and stores. The quality of service is amazing. I went on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and the place was crowded. There are a large selection of private or vip rooms to cater for special occasions and business dinners. Can't wait to go back!
27,5.0,"Upon entering the facility it is clearly evident this building offers the full gambit of stores and sporting & eating highlightsWhilst the wife does extensive shopping there are numerous coffee shops, restaurants,  cinemas,, highest lookout in Seoul, aquarium,  play arama  and games facilities , ice skating rink"
28,5.0,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week
29,4.0,"Lotte World is one of the most interesting places in Korea. We can also say Korean's Disney land. It places in Jamsil station of line 2. Since I was young, I went there and I also went there with my friends. Sometimes, I visited there from the school field trip. Mostly there are a lot of people that is why you should be quick-wittedness. We normally say we need to win on the quick-wittedness game which means that we need to go there when there are fewer people. Anyway, it would be good for you to enjoy Korea's amusement park. By the way, as every amusement is, prices are not that kind."
30,5.0,"If u love themepark then i would definitely recommend, not your usual disneyland themepark but it has its own Korean beauty.  There is also shopping mall around the themepark as well as indoor ice skating."
31,5.0,"A place to live,  enjoy,  entertain, play and shop The location is convenient being close to meteor station lines 2 and 8. The shopping centre is selfsuficient.  Wherever you need as a tourist is available. The theam park is a saviour for all ages.  Top of the tower is a must to visit.  At a hight of 420 meters,  you could enjoy seeing Seoul.  The lotte hotel next door complete it. Enjoy the 5 star accommodation and resturants.  This new and state of the art property is calm get away for families and fresh couples"
32,5.0,If happen anyone in Seoul Korea . I’m highly recommend this cafe for tiramisu at basement food’s area . This cafe specialise In Tiramisu. There’s variety of choices for tiramisu . The best recommended and my favourite is the mix berries and chocolate ones . Check it out from the photo for the cafe name.
33,4.0,"Long queues everywhere and it is quite confusing to use their app to book the timeslot for the rides as there are no instructions on how to book for foreigners.Aside from that, it is quite interesting and fanciful! There's restaurants and shops inside for you to shop your worth while you are there."
34,3.0,"This place is a large, impressive shopping mall with everything from vans the Louis Vuitton.  If you’re an expat there’s also an On the Border so you can get a Tex mex fix.  Great for people watching too."
35,2.0,"We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy .. without fast pass, we had to queue about an hour for each ride. We gave up after two rides , and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead !"
36,4.0,Very nice place for families and young guys Many games and attractive shows Full of fun and enjoyment Must try it
37,1.0,"My last visit was 3 years ago and found a very different now. Staff not friendly, does not know what is inside, too crowded, very noisy, not clean.Chiniese visitors were making alot of noise.It was a big surprise for me.Will never visit and shopping again."
38,5.0,"Even though I'm not a child, I loved it, great place to take kids, lotto world is located inside a shopping mall so theres always plenty of things to do, it has alot of rides, shows and food, i do recommand to see lotto world especially if you have kids."
39,4.0,"We arrived about 15 minutes before opening on a hot Wednesday morning. We ran first for the Atlantis coaster (one of the most popular rides at Lotte World) and after our ride the line was already very long. Other attractions include several more coasters including a virtual reality one called French Revolution, a monorail, and an ice skating rink. The rest of the park was also enjoyable although eventually we got bored and left at around 4 pm. This park is not recommended for thrill seekers, rather it is best for families, couples, and high school groups."
40,4.0,I went there with two of my friends. We did a lot of shopping and eating there. Their food court has food from all around the world. Even Korean street food too.
41,4.0,Negatives:- Outside lines are long waits which is especially difficult in the freezing winters- There are not that many ridesPositives:- Lotte Market is right outside the amusement park- Some of the rides are very different where they use technology and 4D- There are a variety of rides for people of different ages- Able to spend a whole day at Lotte World
42,3.0,"Within the city. With both indoor and outdoor.Its pretty crowded even on weekday.I prefer Everland, I like the pretty flowers and decor depending on season.But if you have limited time, visit Lotte World."
43,3.0,"This theme park has outdoor and indoor area. We went there on weekday and it was super packed with the teenager students whose wearing uniform. Actually not quite sure how the education system here works? But based on my experience not really recommended if you are taking too young kid to this place neither elder due to huge distance also too many floors in the building.It's confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance. We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there, plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group. We were disappointed with the management team here on careless. Free WiFi here sucks, it doesn't really work mostly unable to connect. Ticket will be cheaper in the afternoon but I don't think I want to be back again, doesn't worth the money."
44,3.0,"Ok if you're from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios, six flags, and disneyland, then you're going to be disappointed. If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world."

So I made plan thoroughly and almost succeeded this time.(that means I spend more money and I rode more rides and waited less)What I want to tell you guys is that 1. Lotte is not a Korean enterprise(actually it's more like Japanese company).2. It's hard to find any employee who can speak English fluently.3. There are not enough space for visitors to hide from sun ray on the 'magic island'.4. Don't go there on the weekend.5. Foods are expensive and crappy in Lotte world. 6.

46,5.0,Here is a very nice. Have a lot of thing that you can join and play. I been here from10.00 AM until 7.00PM. I buy a one day ticket it very nice. I want to go there again
47,1.0,"We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day. The day has been gloomy thus, we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed. Upon reaching, we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up. We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page. We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue. As we walked on, the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 0-15min wait. Upon rushing it, were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time. The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location. After an hour or so, we so frustrated by what's happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer. We were shocked to know that at the point of our query, only a total of 8 rides (and they were all kiddie attractions) or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance! I can't imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening. We were there for 3hours, 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides. The good thing out of the whole situation, we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasn't."
48,5.0,I went to this place. Really lovely . its one of the biggest indoor adventure parc. You can evwn go in rainyday.
49,4.0,"The indoor amusement park is perfect for those who prefer to stay out of the elements (ex. Rain, cold or heat).  There were some rides for kids and adults in addition to amusement park snacks.  The hot balloon ride is only for standing, however you get a good view of the entire indoor area.  The rides were fun and thrilling."
50,5.0,Great place to shop. There’s a big duty free shop inside which is spacious and lots of things. Worth a visit if u need duty free products.
51,5.0,"Lotte World Adventure was awesome!!! As my 2nd day of Seoul, I made plan with my friends when we were in our country, which was me and my friends enjoy Lotte World Adventure and then go to Lotte tower near Lotte world. But we couldn't make it unfortunately. There were so many people in Lotte world so we had to wait for a long time like 40 min. per a ride. However, we really really had fun in Lotte cause there are plenty of rides which look cool. Plus, the happiest thing was that we got discount 20% of one-day Free Pass Ticket via Visit Korea Mastercard. We thought that the ticket price is a bit expensive honestly, but my friend found the link of Visit Korea Mastercard so we could get 20% off. How cool! We used the ticket as much as we can. At the end, we were in Lotte world all day long till closed time. Now so miss Lotte."
52,3.0,"This was part of my tour visit to Lotte world , there's a indoor and outdoor theme park , shopping mall , we spend around 2-3 hours here . The theme park have been operating for some years now . It's a big run down"
53,4.0,"Had a  fun afternoon/evening with friends.A few tips:- Tickets are normally 55,000 won, but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28,000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22,000 - 34,000 won - which I would highly recommend. - If you do buy tickets on Klook you enter via the South gate - The Magic Pass lets you skip the queue, which most of the main rides had a wait time of 1.5 - 2 hours. - Don't download the app to try and reserve a spot on the ride to skip/queue thing and don't try and use the Magic pass Kiosk - the app kept crash and only let you book in 15 minute slots which filled up pretty quickly and the same with the kiosks. - - The rides for the magic pass would say 'close' but when we walked up to try and use our ticket the attendant will mark off your ticket let you straight though - winner (after mucking around with the app and kiosk for quite some time)"
54,3.0,The place is very nice to travel with the family.We went there is weekend and it was very crowded .Next time we are thing to ho in week days.
55,4.0,"I visited Lotte World as group of friends in January 2018. It was the coldest month in Seoul since the temperature drop to -18 but we managed to enjoy the theme park especially the Magic Island (outdoor area). The indoor area more focused on children’s and younger’s attractions. For thrill seeker like us, we spent the whole day in outdoor area. The good things about Lotte World is the  queues is managable and almost all the outdoor games are open even tho’ it’s winter. We reccomend the gyro drop, gyro swing, atlantis adventure (they excluded the water since it’s winter), and bunge drop for all thrill seeker out there. It’s worth to try those attraction when you visit Seoul. Don’t be afraid of the cold because there’s a lot heaters in outdoor area. If you bought the ticket beforehand through online platform etc, you need to exchange the QR code to physical ticket through the South Gate Entrance. There’s drinking station in almost all food hall.If you want to visit the Lotte World half day, you can get a cheaper price by buying the half day ticket but I still reccomend you to visit this park early in the morning or noon and enjoy this park until evening because there’s illumination in the castle area."
56,5.0,"Wow! That word truly sums up Lotte World. An amusement park both indoors and outdoors, shopping mall from luxury to daily goods and even a food court that will leave you spoilt for choices.It is easily accessible by subway and weather proof for winter time as you will be able to shop in comfort and play in theme park away from extreme conditions if need be. Our only complaint is that they made this too easy for us to blow our budgets out of the waters! Would recommend at least half a day here if you are planning to shop and experience the park."
57,5.0,"This is indoor theme park.Went with a few friends and the experience is quite nice.it's a super fun trip!and I downloaded a 25% discount coupon from baynaru!!There's both an indoor and outdoor amusement park with plenty of rides for all ages, countless shops, restaurants, shows, and attractions. There's even an indoor ice rink, a bowling alley, and shooting range which are quite popular as well."
58,3.0,Outdoor rides were all closed. Thus the queue for the indoor rides were crazily long. I would go again in spring or summer probably.
59,4.0,"Do your homework. Like how to use the fast pass, where are the machines to make the reservations or download the apps ahead of time. Otherwise you will waste a lot of time forming line. We went from 11am-3pm. I would actually recommend going earlier to avoid the crowd."
60,3.0,"Wasn’t a very good experience as I came in winter. Most of the rides were closed, so the remaining rides that are opened had very long queues! I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each! However what I’ve observed is that it’ll be a great place for kids in winter. Lots of kiddy rides that’s indoor, away from the harsh winter air.Will recommend coming in other seasons."
61,5.0,"The rides are awesome here, and all the decors are really fancy. Avoid visiting on weekends since there will be longer lines for the rides. Restaurants are slightly overpriced but has good quality. You can also bring your lunchbox in, there's a separate terrace/eating place. Check on their website before visiting, they offer lots of benefits and coupons!"
62,4.0,"We went on a weekday which happen to fall on a day when many of the schools brought their kids so the lines were a bit long for the bigger rides. There are a variety of different  roller coasters, crazy spin you upside down rides, just cruising ""slow paced"" rides, 3D attractions, A HAUNTED HOUSE (really liked this one), and lots of fun rides for the kids. They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting.This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out. I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale.I went with my sisters & friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together. The customer service was pretty good and friendly for the most part. Kids would have fun for sure but going with friends as adults is fun as well."
63,5.0,This park is so much fun! My friend and I went for the day (we’re both in our 30’s) and we had a blast!! The rides are a lot of fun.  I was so impressed that a lot of the rides are indoors. It’s a must-see for any age!
64,5.0,"It may be packed, loud, the ticket may be a bit expensive but this is fun! Great place to get loose and just relax and ride the gyro and all other crazy trains, machines, boats.... Feel like a kid again, go there to have a great time and just take it easy and have a great day!"

Even though some of the lines were long, by planning ahead, I was able to rid on quite a number of attractions before the end of the day. One downside was the hot weather. So be careful if you go during the summer!"
66,5.0,"This place is a peace of heaven , the view is good , it's safe , the building itself contains a big shopping center , it's so close to so many places and the heart of seuol"
67,5.0,Good for enjoy with friends and family  cupuls too much  funny...so many adventure  games hear excellent ....
68,4.0,"Lotte world as a themepark was great! My friends and I went to both Lotte world and Everland, and although Lotte world looks more 'kiddish' in appearance, the rides here are actually more thrilling than the ones at Everland (only the T express is thrilling there, but requires an almost 2h long wait). The pirate ship ride here was faster, and went up higher. There is both an indoor and outdoor portion, and you can easily spend a few hours here! I also highly recommend the Flume ride, Gyro Swing and the Atlantis!! However, some rides were unfortunately unavailable due to the weather, but you can download the app to check when they open!It is also connected to the lotte department store, and the food section as well - where you can get local snacks"
69,3.0,Bring the children here n they will love itAll the cute things in the park is so colorfulNice for picture
70,4.0,"I reserved a whole day for Lotte World, and spent a fun day here with my friends. There were both indoors and outdoors for the theme park so you will be able to enjoy the rides even it is raining. There are more activities suitable for children indoors compared to outdoors as there are mainly rides for the outdoor part. It wasn't too expensive to have food inside. I recommend you to come here if you have a spare day in Seoul."
71,5.0,"If you're a department store junkie, this place is for you! Lots of cosmetics, lifestyle, and designer clothing shops here. Some Korean friends likened it to a more upscale Macy's or Nordstrom's. The food court in the bottom is fantastic. It's a wonderful place to sit down or pick up meals to go from the grocery or from the other food vendors. Great selection for a really solid price!"
72,5.0,"Super big theme park, both indoors and outdoors. Indoor games closes till 10pm. Have a few scary rides indoors especially the French revolution where the queue was as long as 90mins at around 6pm.Please purchase tix from funtastickorea, funko for short. Costs 29,000Krw I think can't remember but it was 45% discount. Pay online and they will email you the tickets which you show to the counter to exchange for actual tickets. We went on a Saturday so it was filled with locals. Managed to try almost all the games but we left the place at 11pm. We started at 11am though."
73,5.0,"This place is suitable and sufficient for a day's worth of fun for kids and even adults accompanying kids. Directly connected to Jamsil Station (Seoul Subway Line 2, 8), Exit 4, it is definitely a convenient place to get to with kids around."
74,3.0,"For the price it was what I expected. I was disappointed they only sold beer at one restaurant and lines were insanely long. More of a place for kids and families, not adults who wanna drink and ride rides."
75,3.0,"For a mid-lifer, I found this place as just okay. Just to while your time. Good thing we went here at around 7pm where the entrance fee is much cheaper. If you have been to Disneyland, Universal Studios and Ocean Park and you just want to visit and not take the rides, then go at 7pm."
76,5.0,"This is a huge and very complicated place, make sure you get a map before you got in or else you will waste your time to search for places. There is indoor and outdoor activity, it is very fun place and I suggest you to go there after 4PM because it is cheaper. I made a video on my trip to seoul, come and check it out and see how the theme park looks like. search by title :#6 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 5 SEOUL - CULTURAL DAY"
77,4.0,"Loved the rides at Lotte World! My friends and I went on a Saturday, and some queues for rides were rather long. French Revolution had a waiting time of 60mins. For daredevils, please do try out the Gyro Drop! It may seem intimidating (I was regretting while waiting for the ride to start), but it was a superb, unforgettable experience. And best of all, there wasn't a queue :) Best part about lotte world is the indoor park, where you can take shelter in when the weather is too warm or it starts to rain."
78,4.0,"I went here as part of my college university in Seoul, so I can't tell you much about ticketing since it was free for me, HOWEVER I can tell you what to expect inside. After handing your ticket to the people in the front they will return it, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT ON YOU BECAUSE SOME RIDES WILL ASK FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE! If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first, just because it's still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short. For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches, some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia, many things, including roller coasters are built for smaller people. I am a larger woman, and i was able to ride the bumper cars, the spin guro, the hot air balloons, the carasole, and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people. Bring your own food.  While there is food in the amusement park, and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the U.S. it is still just amusement food. I ate at ""school food"" which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki. If you have younger ones, or if you're not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy (it was an hour for the hot air balloons). All in all it was fun, but it is packed.  Definitely a tourist spot and workers are decent with English :)"
79,3.0,Don't expect the international service here if you used to visit Disneyland or universal studio or intentional theme park else where. This is the lower standard than you expect.Staffs is not friendly. They are dead like they are forcing to work here1 out of 10 scores for the service mind2 out of 10 scores for the helpful service And staff here don't speak English!!!!!!! And they ignore you sometime with the dead face Some of the rides look interesting but you have to pay more for example VR zone
80,4.0,"I often bring my friends to this place. If you've never visited this place, it is worth visit. It is very convenient to visit with transportation and lots of attractions to ride. Also some VR activities recently added are very interesting. If you pay with Mastercard, you can have 20% discount on ticket so price is affordable I think. : )"
81,1.0,"This place is super crowded, i went here last february with my friends and we were not able to ride any rides. This place is full of kids and locals and i think some has their field trips that day.  Few rides and a bit old or overused i think they need renovation. Well i think this amusement park is for kids, for teenanagers better go to Everland 😀"
82,5.0,"What makes Lotte world different from many other theme parks is that it has quite a huge air-conditioned (what a great plus for summer season) indoor theme park section. There are many levels of different rides and simply exploring the place makes an interesting experience. I like that rides are of varying thrill levels, making it suitable for kids as well as thrill-seekers. I would definitely recommend it for families even with young children as they have a huge kiddy play section.I went on a weekday and hardly queued for more than 10 min per ride, and I took about 14 rides in total. Only had to queue 30 min for 1 or 2 rides. I was also lucky to find discounted tickets online for foreigners and ended up paying 29,000 instead of 52,000 won. You can google it and purchase them in advance, but remember to bring your passport there."
83,4.0,"This is one of the famous amusement park in Korea esp in SeoulIt has both outdoor and indoor attraction. I really enjoyed playing in here.. even one day was not enough! They has full of wifi area everywhere and I needed it so much that time :) they offered an application on phone for us, so that we dont need to queueing up for long time in every attraction, but unfortunately there were some attraction that didnt work when I went there.. but I want to go there again next time!"
84,5.0,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.
85,5.0,"Lotte world is huge!! I went on a Friday and spent an entire day there! Despite it being a weekday, the place was super crowded. On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride. The queues can be quite painful, but the rides were well worth the queue. I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first. Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon. There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive. Also, weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors! Overall, I had a great day there. But it was really tiring to queue though."
86,5.0,"If you don't know the secret to the beautiful skin of Korean women, you must visit this place!  It has every cosmetic brand known to humankind!  This also is shoppers paradise!  Food court in the basement conveniently located and easy to get to!"
87,1.0,"I spent more time waiting in line than actually trying the rides. I spent two hours just for a 5 minute ride. It's really disappointing. I enjoyed the VR and the folk museum tho. The 50,000 won is not worth it."
88,4.0,"Lotte World is a park that is different than any other you've been to before. Most of the park is located in a huge mall with rides stuck in the walls of several different floors. There is also a small outdoor section that maximizes its space by going underground. Lotte World is not short on attractions, but there is no single wow attraction there --- a lot of good ones, but no marquee. That's the one complaint I have about the park. Many of the rides are out of the box purchases from ride manufacturers. The rides are in no way modified and just plopped down here or there. With all of the rides though, how do you make it through everything in a day? Use the Lotte World app to book Fastpass times throughout the day. You get 3 free ones a day. Depending on what you like, you should make your choices some combination of Atlantis, French Revolution, Comet Express, Flume, and Pharaoh's Fury. These rides get the longest queues. Furthermore, you'll likely have to cut some rides out because of the volume of stuff there is to do. To me, the must do attractions are: Atlantis, Comet Express, Pharaoh's Fury, Adventures of Sinbad, and Aeronauts Balloon Ride. The rides that get a lot of attention, but you can skip are: French Revolution, Flume, and the Conquistador. The rides that don't get a lot of attention, but you shouldn't miss are: Castle Magic Show, Fantasy Dream, Jungle Adventure, and Fly Venture."
89,3.0,"Kind of wonderland, When i was there i thought I went to future , all games and entertainments was by using VR (virtual reality) devices, in some points it was interesting but when you think deeply there were no real activity most of the items were virtual , very few real things"
90,4.0,Our first stop is this theme park. It nice indoor theme park. Enjoyed roaming around this place. Ride the giant loop also then the horror house. Then going around the place.
91,5.0,"I highly recommend to visit this place in the morning, since you'll likely spend about the whole day in there. There's a lot to see and a great number of attractions you'll want to try. Definitely try the Mickymouse waffles outside the main building, they are delicious!"
92,4.0,This is one huge mall with plenty of American brand name stores and lots of restaurants. It has a great cinema and plenty of space to sit and to explore. I am travelling solo but being a father of 2 children it was nice seeing a large section dedicated to children.
93,4.0,A very good parkThe entrance for one day is 53k wonThe place is big with lots of gamesIndoor and outdoors gamesSome games still u have to pay even with entrance feeThe staff are very helpful and friendly. . Highly recommend it
94,5.0,"This theme park was SOOO much fun! It's so worth the trip! There is an indoor Adventure World and the outdoor Magic Island - be sure to get the correct ticket if you're planning to visit both. There are lockers to leave your belongings - just remember to bring your ticket with you because they do check it at the rides.We went on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't THAT crowded. Be sure to get a map so you can navigate the rides that you're interested in. We decided to just pick the thrill rides because we only had a few hours till closing. The queues were an average of 30-45 mins, but the waits are VERY worth it. The thrill rides are super fun we even queued twice for The Atlantis (Magic Island). There's loads of F&B options and restrooms were conveniently located and very clean. We stayed till closing and at about 8pm they have a float parade at the main atrium of Adventure world which is beautiful to watch. We really felt our inner children come alive when we were there. I'm definitely going back on my next visit!"
95,4.0,"Take the subway to Jamsil station and walk through exit 4 to park. Lotte world offers both indoor and outdoor theme parks and also ice skating area. What I prefer is all the outdoor rides. I did not wait in the long line since I went there in the weekday early afternoon. You can also enjoy the restaurants, coffee shops and souvenir shops."
96,4.0,Outdoor and indoor theme park. Many things can do there. U can reach there with subway and stop at jamsil station exit 3 or 4.
97,4.0,Great place to have fun with friends can spend a whole day there. There is stuff for everyone to enjoy.  Very easy to get to from the subway station which is right underground
98,4.0,"LotteWorld has four levels of rides and in addition, there is a massive outdoor area which comprises of massive rides. I went with a friend and although we couldn't try everything, it is definitely something that a young adult could still enjoy. I recommend you to pre-purchase your ticket (at least 2 days as per requirement) from online as you could save as much as 35%. (Need your passport)However, there is a downside. Massive queues. And when i say massive, i mean average 1hr wait and this was on a Tuesday and not school holiday period. If you are willing to spend some more money, get the magic pass. It allows you to jump queues. Also, make sure you bought the 'All-day passport"" as it allows you to go on any rides."
99,3.0,"Magic pass is the key to avoid long queues. Get the apps in your phone and scan your ticket to ensure smooth entry. Highly recommended for free entry (Fly Venture). Muslim tourists need not worry about halal food, Pasha kebab available in the park."
100,4.0,"Return trip to Seoul over the Long CNY holidays. Me and friends were in Seoul last April for the cherry blossom. Didn't managed to visit Lotte world during our last visit.For Muslim Travellers don't be dismay when you're in Lotte world. There's a prayer room and Halal Turkish food ""Pasha"" on the 2nd floor and prayer corner (I think) on the 3rd floor.P/s: DO not dine at IRON BULL restaurant as it is not HALAL."
101,5.0,Not many rides that can be played by children aged under 4 years. Each game will have to be dealt size. But easy to get here by public transport.However we enjoy our day here
102,5.0,"This theme park is very easy to get to - right off the train and a short walk through the mall attached to the entrance. There are a few floors inside with different rides, around an indoor ice skating rink. On the outside, there are larger rides. There is also a cultural/history museum - I didn't find the exhibits to be too interesting inside that. It's a really fun place to spend a day. It was great to have inside areas to escape the cold. I really enjoyed my time here - something for all ages, rides for everyone, and things are not spaced out to the point where it is a struggle to get around inside the theme park."
103,5.0,"As soon as I walked into this place I felt like a kid again! It's incredible how they've managed to put everything inside, which is obviously a bonus in the winter. We paid for the 1 day pass (allows access to all rides, except some small arcade type games which are only another 2000-3000) and also managed to find a discount code so paid the equivalent of £25. I would highly recommend going early and having the whole day, even in mid November it was fairly busy. Luckily you can get magic passes for rides, so you go to the ride, and collect a queue jump, which will give you a time to go back to the ride to use it (beats waiting an hour!). There are all sorts of parades and performances through the day, I would definitely stay for the evening performance, we got to see the Christmas miracle parade and I've never felt so happy in my life. There's also an ice rink downstairs, you have to pay around 10000 won extra for use but if you have time then why not? It's definitely worth the money, especially more so if you have kids!"
104,4.0,"Actually I visited this park last year with my few friends. I think that the Korean are very nice to us, they will actively ask us do we need help and ask us to join them as well. I am a person that can’t actually play some facilities that are very extreme and exciting. However, all those facilities there are fine for me. My friend and I enjoyed the time there. One of the reasons why I like there is that all those foods (not spicy as most of the Korean food are very spicy) and facilities are very suitable for me too.At last, if you want to go to a theme park in Korea, I would recommend you to wear sneakers because you have to walk for a long journey to visit all the facilities and when you are playing roller coaster, make sure your shoes won’t be fallen."
105,4.0,"Hong Kong, Japan and Korea also have their own theme park, such as Disney and Universal Studios. In Macau there is no theme park.This time I went to Lotte World. It was a very big theme park, there were divided into two parts, one was indoors and another part was outdoors. Both have many games offer to people play. One of the games I liked was roller coaster, it was very exciting and had fun! We also saw the parade indoors; it was different from Disney and Universal Studios. We saw some local students in here for their school travelling. There also have some restaurant but I have not tried it.The price was not expensive at all.if you come to Lotte World in your birthday month, you will have discount of your admission ticket."
106,4.0,"this theme park is very big , cant manage to play all the games , too crowded on the famous game , but we have a lot of fun"
107,5.0,"We really enjoyed shopping in Lotte mall located in Dongdaemon. Everything is well organised, high quality garments, currency exchange and food courts, everything available at one tower. Would recommend to everyone who likes pleasant shopping."
108,3.0,Went for their Halloween night on the 31st October.  It's very crowded and not worth it to pay for the 1 day pass after 5pm. The special are performers dressing up as various monsters and 4 existing rides painted or decorated in Halloween themes.
109,4.0,It depends on which time of the year you visit. There are different kind of discount ongoing..it may not be stated online. So when you buy tickets do ask the counter do not to miss out on discount. They have both indoor and outdoor rides.
110,5.0,Such a great place ! I was enjoyed all the attraction indoor and outdoor! My suggestion please teach your staff to speak english. That would be better hard to get info from staff.
111,4.0,An excellent place for kids to enjoy with fantastic shows and a parade.  Good location by subway Line 2 going to Jamsil Station.
112,4.0,Fun attractions and nice people! The food and the restaurants there might be a bit too expensive but they are yummy. The tickets may be a bit overpriced too...also do not go there in the summer because you will die from the heat and it can be very crowded. I suggest going there in the morning because there are so many people in the afternoon and in the evening that you have to wait an hour for each ride.
113,4.0,"Just like a kid, i was very happy to visit this amusement park. Really enjoy the ride and the indoor park. The castle is one of the must visit place and also we need to be patient about the long lines~"
114,4.0,Lotte World is an amazing theme park and has an extremely big shopping mall with lots of shopping/food choices for people of all ages. Must-visit when in Seoul! Alight at Jamsil station if you want to go to Lotte World.
115,4.0,Had a good time spending half a day with friends in Lotte World. The place was big. There were indoor and outdoor sections. Indoor section was more child-friendly. Outdoor section was more for the thrill-seekers. The parade was fun. Do visit in the morning as soon as it open to avoid long queues.
116,5.0,There's an inside and outside area for the park. Make sure you get outside to ride the more adult rides. The inside is dominated by the ice rink. Take the hot air balloon ride to see the whole inside of the park from the air. Very pretty with all the rides and lights.
117,3.0,"This place is mostly for kids. While there are a few rides that are suitable for adults, most of this place is aimed at children/teens. So if you are on a family trip, this is a must visit. If you are adult friends on a trip, this place can be left out.The place itself is 60% indoors and 40 % outdoors. It got lots of rides for kids and also features daily shows."
118,4.0,"Is literally a world. Ice skating, slides, restaurants. Ideal for big groups of all ages. Still prefer Everland in Yongin but this isn't bad"
119,5.0,"The place was awesome specially if you're trying to hide from the sun yet still want to enjoy a theme park! The park offers awesome rides from traditional carousels to extreme ones! The food inside was relatively cheap compared to other famous theme parks in Asia, the staff are so nice and can speak english, the park is also conveniently located near a subway station which has a direct access to the park."
120,5.0,"Don't miss this one. Lotte World is just similar to any theme park in the world. Great and most interesting place to visit in Seoul Korea. Inside have nice restaurant, souvenir shop and many more.."
121,5.0,"You can find something to do it, definitely. doesn't matter how old are you. Everything full of fun and you feel safe."
122,5.0,"In Lotte I could fine all kind of clothes. Not only clothes but also accesories pretty good and ethnic souvenirs I could fine here as a gift. And in front of the Lotte, me and my friends just sitting in the yard and many attracting buildings around."
123,3.0,"We went during Summer vacation so it was especially crowded. As others have mentioned, there are different admission prices based on how many rides you want to ride. With the humid weather and the long lines, we really didn't ride too many rides.Now I have to been to Disney and Busch Gardens and this is not even in the same category. However, if you visit with this in mind, and don't have crazy high expectations, this can still be fun for kids. We were able to ride a ride that goes up and down on a semi-circle and spins simultaneously, an indoor ride where you can ride a horse and shoot at a video screen as a competition, an underground ""roller coaster,"" a large pole that drops you from high up, and a few more.Honestly, I enjoyed walking around and seeing all the displays the most and the Folk Museum. The Folk Museum had hands-on activities, miniature displays of Korea's palaces, and an older gentleman who would write your name in English, Korean, or Chinese with beautiful illustrations.There were lots of food vendors selling everything from Turkish ice cream, hot dogs, water, slushies, DipNDots, and more.Wouldn't recommend for just adults. Also, this park could really work on improving its line efficiency."
124,4.0,"I'm  too lazy to look for various discount benefits for my trips, so I didn't expect any discount. But the clerk at the ticket office said I could get free pass tickets 20% off benefit if I just pay by MasterCard. It was nice."
125,4.0,"Even before i visited this place. that time, i was excited. but the ticket was too pricey.this time i purchased ticket to master card. i discounted to 20% even free pass tickets. i really enjoyed this time. I did not play much because of the rain but so happy"
126,3.0,"Came here with a few friends on a weekday. The lines were average for rides, but there are not that many ""thriller"" rides. This amusement park is more suited for children-high schoolers. Saw a lot of families and couples. Some parts of the amusement park are neat, such as the hot air balloon ride, the Atlantis Ride (the only fun ride). Probably a great place for families and little kids, but not for young adults. It can get hot inside, but luckily the food and drink prices are not super expensive!"
127,3.0,"There are plenty of rides for kids in the inside and outside areas of the park. Good to visit on a rainy day with children but as most bigger rides are outside, they might be closed during rain. Be prepared for long lines, 30-50 min for the best rides. In my opinion, the place looks nice and most rides are good but it is still nothing like Disney or Universal Studios in Orlando, FL.There was a foreigner discount when we visited so you might want to google that in case you find a coupon for that. You can make reservations for some rides for free so that you can skip the line on a specific time but by noon there were no seats left for the rides that actually had a long line."
128,4.0,"Lotte world truth to be told felt like a Disneyland wannabe...However the atmosphere and buzz was there with enthusiastic and polite service staff. The structure of the park was also very unique, being integrated into a mall does come with certain restrictions but one thing for sure, your ride experience is not being compromised... French Revolution is a MUST! TIP: There are certain special discounted entrance tickets for visits after 1pm and 3 or 4pm and yet all rides can be taken. The park closes at 10pm so there is still time if you plan your rides smartly."
129,4.0,"You could spend a whole day here, or even two, and still not see every single part of it. Lotte world is massive, like... really big. And it's got absolutely everything you could want. In terms of shopping, it's probably the biggest mall in S. Korea, and it's got every store you can think of, and every item you may need. The food hall was my favourite place to go when I needed something a little more western, and it's well connected by subway so it's also a great place to go during the winter months. And when you get bored of shopping, there's the amusement park. I had heard a lot about Lotte World Amusement Park and I was interested in seeing how they'd make it work being indoors. I've got to say they've done it pretty well. Spread over a few floors, the themeing is beautifully done and you tend to forget that outside there's a mall full of busy shoppers. It is geared towards younger children, but the rides are still super fun, and there are a few thrill rides to keep the adults happy. There's the usual korean food brands, and a loads of confectionary stands. You can even buy facial products! I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you have a spare day."
130,5.0,"there is so much to do here, from all the rides to the games to the shopping. It is a fun place not only for children but children at heart. The lines are a bit long on some of the rides but worth the wait."
131,1.0,"Went there many years ago and went back with children this time around. The entire themepark is poorly laid out, lacking in signposting and has a confusing map with poor instructions. The staff operating the rides do not necessarily follow the rules posted on the walls, and set their own rules. Most cannot speak English. One staff even decided not to operate the ride because they told a few of us were too ""old"" (i.e. in our 30s). Themes for the rides were very random and showed no consistency. Shops selling things unconnected with the theme park (e.g. household items) would pop up at some parts of the park. A word of warning: re-entry is NOT PERMITTED. It was terribly disappointing and we will certainly not go back again."
132,4.0,"Lotte World is great, divided into indoor and outdoor, and have many fun rides. However, this place is like half of Everland, hence seems so small."
133,3.0,"The hotel was good, very classic design and skipped the theme park as I had been there a few years before. Attentive concierge and great room service. The worst experience was shopping at the duty free store as it was overcrowded with Chinese visitors. In fact, most of the salespersons just wanted to attend to them and it was impossible to get their attention. Definitely need some etiquette consultants or crowd control managers around because it was very noisy, uncontrolled and awful that made shopping very unpleasant. Lifts were overcrowded and older folks couldn't get into them."
134,4.0,there are small outside area with games suitable for adults such as roller coaster and inside area with ice rink with many games more suitable for kids
135,1.0,"Got a headache from the noise. This is an amusement park with an indoor section and outdoor section. Smallish roller coaster ( not the same intensity as in the US given space limitation), cable car ride, indoor skating rink, music show .... Kind of like a condensed Disney land. Lots of kids running around screaming (it's target audience are kids and their parents after all) and constant music. Too noisy for me. There is the lotte department store attached to the complex so I ditched out and headed to the (quieter) store."
136,3.0,Even on weekdays Super crowded :( But rides were awesome! Worth a shot once for beautiful pictures. Similar to Disney but local characters instead!
137,3.0,"This was my second time and we learned from our mistakes when we planned it.The park is located in the city which is its greatest benefit and downfall. Yes it is easy to get to but in a city the size of Seoul it will always be busy!This time round we went on a school day. The queues were ok, about 1 hour (previously I had been on a Saturday and it was 3 hours per ride).The park itself is ok but isn't the greatest. There are 3 roller coasters which are short but fun and a few thrill rides which were good. Lots of food options. One last thing though I went with my two korean brothers in law and because they were korean they got half price but I didn't being foreign. Not cool. It's what we call discrimination. But anyway what I would say is plan it well to avoid crowds otherwise it can be a frustrating and painful (standing in line) waste of a day."
138,3.0,"Really need to be updated and I believe it's got potential to be Korean Disney land with a potential and opportunities  of a Lotte brand. Honestly I've expected more and there was nothing to do. Would be nice to take the kids, but nothing special. Would not go there again."
139,4.0,"Lotte world was fun and exciting!Loved the roller coasters.Outdoors will be more fun for teenagers.However, long queues everywhere.Be expected to wait 2 hours ++ during peak periods."
140,4.0,"Cheap and easy to find. Lotte world was a day well spent lines were quite long for the  rollacosters, even the bad ones. TIP: do Atlantis and the French revolution, skip the others. The lines were otherwise very manageable. Staff were friendly and helpful, I really enjoyed the mirror maze, best I've been to."
141,3.0,"At first thought this park was more adult friendly, but its pretty much for kids. Nonetheless it is a good time to just go and hang out. If youre looking for a good theme park with rides and attractions Everland would be your best bet"
142,3.0,"I went to Lotte World with a friend of mine and omg, sad to say it was not our cup of coffee. It was basically too crowded with locals. Waiting time of almost all rides was like 1 hour to two hours. I will say that it is good for kids as there is a large indoor theme park for kids however its not as good as Universal Studios to begin with since I overheard some locals saying that LotteWorld is the same as Universal Studios. Haunted house needs to be improved! It was super dissapointing that many people were afraid to get into the haunted house but all we just did was to be seated down and watch a 'scary' animation movie which is not even scary to begin with. The department store is not even something I will recommend to go too. If you are coming from places like Singapore, Malaysia, US, Europe, its basically the same store as every other shopping mall. Muslim travellers, there is no halal food at all but there is side stalls that sells waffles and stuffs that you can eat. Overall LotteWorld is dissapointing. Will not recommend anyone to go but if you are a first timer, why not try it once."
143,4.0,"Located inside Lotte mall, this theme park wow-ed me with big rides available inside a mall. This theme park also connected to outdoor area which available when the weather is good. I visited this places during rain, si better keep playing inside to avoid the cold weather, once the rain stop the outdoor rides will be available. Make sure you make a visit at a good weather day, also check if there is any holidays happens during the week of your visit. While I'm visiting several school held a trip to this place so the crod made me hard to enjoy all the rides"
144,2.0,"It looked grand from outside. However, it was such a disappointment. It's more like a teenagers and kids amusement park, rather than for all ages. Paid SGD56++ and went only to 3 places and left."
145,4.0,"The moment you enter inside lotte world, you will feel that you have stepped into another world and left city's hustle and bustle behind. It is hard to believe that you are still in the midst of the city.There are a number of rides here but the major minus point is you will have to wait hours together in the line for your turn to get the ride. But don't let this discourage you as the rides are worth the wait. An option to reduce your waiting time is download the lotte world app and after you buy your entry tickets, book your ride from the app. These people will get first preference to go for the rides. We came to know about this too late, so we couldn't avail this option.Don't miss the gyro drop ride. It feels like you are having a free fall while sitting in a chair from 75 metres height. By the time you finish your ride, your adrenaline will be pumping into your veins and the euphoria is something to be experienced, not to be explained."
146,4.0,"Although lotteworld is smaller than seoulland and everland, it is palced in seoul. So it is convenient to go there by public transportation. If being rain,you can play inside"
147,3.0,check out one time. but the themes change really rarely so not much to do after u been to all rides in two hours.
148,4.0,"Firstly pop on Google play store and download the app. This is essential as when u get your tickets you can scan them in and it gives you booking slots to reserve places using a sort of que jump system to get on some busy rides quicker.  You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy.If you're not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1 :-) You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks.There's a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing. Some of the rides you'd expect to be a bit worse aren't (the aladdin one, log flume, jungle ride, bungee) and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe (possibly being designed for smaller average height people they don't always have the best neck support for taller people?). Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site. Staff are friendly and helpful."
149,4.0,I went here only for the hard rock cafe shirt 😅Then i saw they play this movie from big screens and the screen moving..wow hahah.Outside you can see pororo..lots of pororo
150,2.0,"I was not impressed at all, I think everland is prob a better choice. The rides were not impressive and there were too many kids queuing up so waiting time is crazy."
151,4.0,"We got discounted tickets so be sure to check for discount online. The theme park has both indoor and outdoor portions. The rides in the indoor park are mostly for younger kids, while the scarier rides are outside. Unfortunately, many rides indoors were closed when we were there. Aside from the rides, there are also many shops and food stalls. One day should be spent in Lotte World."
152,3.0,"Just a normal shopping center, they have duty free at the top floor but we found that some of the cosmetics prices are more expensive than the department store downstaires so dont be fooled, do check around the prices before you purchased anything. And the staffa at duty free speak very poor poor english. Shopping at the airport might be better. They also have aquarium here."
153,4.0,"I went here with my friends and we were amazed by its huge size. One day is not enough to tour all the attraction especially with the long queue on the rides, sometimes it took us one hour before we can get into rides, it is really time consuming,  so i suggest if you have the budget , book in their hotel for 2 days to maximize your visit. Good thing we were able to get cheap ticket, 60% discount. There were also lot of restaurant to choose from and they have lotte mart to shop which we did before leaving the park. You will really enjoy coming here as it is indoor with an air condition, so no problem if it rains."
154,4.0,Fun place with lots to see and do.  Wish i was younger so i could really enjoy the rides. The place is laid out beautifully.  Spend time and enjoy a day.  its worth it.
155,5.0,"I was stationed in Korea and the KATUSA's we worked with took us there.  Best experience ever!  Three levels of everything you can imagine looking down at the huge ice skating rink at the bottom.  The outdoor rides were phenomenal.  There wasn't as long a wait in line as most people suggested.  The perk of having Korean Nationals as friends, they knew the best time to go.  Stay hydrated summer and winter.  I'm from Florida and the summers there are much milder.  You probably wouldn't die of heatstroke like at Disney, still hydrate.  This place is a definite must do."
156,5.0,"been here twice and i still love it. this place is mostly overcrowded even during the weekdays. the ride would take at least 30min waiting time.. korean couples love this place. i loved the atmosphere here. id recommend going to Everland as it is bigger and more choices of rides. still, if you only have time in Seoul then this is the place. take the metro to Jamsil station and it is directly connected to Lotte World. theres also Lotte Mart outside which is worth a visit."
157,4.0,"the waiting time in the lines of the attractions where quiet long, because we went there on a crowdy day. Additionally we used the ""After4 Tickets"" because it was a bit cheaper, but in the end we wished to have more time in the park.Anyways it was fun to visit the biggest indoor amusement park of the world!"
158,5.0,"Go with your family 👪  to Lotte World early and  you need two days to finish all attractions. There're a lot of restaurants  coffee, snacks shops."
159,4.0,"Visited with my aunt from Vienna, Austria. There were some fun rides and a really cool hot air balloon ride around the entire park. The mall is a separate attraction, so don't try to leave Lotte World and get back in. They won't let you. The only reason my aunt and I were able to leave and then come back is because I was quite assertive about it. It was extremely crowded, so if you don't mind lots of people, give it a try."
160,4.0,Big indoor theme park.but too crowded.waited 1 ride for about 3hrs.didnt manage to play alot. Outdoor themepark have more exciting rides!
161,4.0,"Even though there are long lines, and a lot of people, I really enjoyed coming here with my friends. No, I'm not being sarcastic. My friends and I talked a lot and got to know more things about each other while waiting in line. It was quite fun! And we got to ride a lot of rides. They were really fun, especially, French evolution, Gyro Spin/swing/drop and the Atlantis. (By the way, since these attractions are the most popular I recommend you come early in the morning, when there's not as much as people, and wait in line or get a fast pass!)  And, for the people who'd rather shop than go to an amusement park, they can skate at the ice rink or shop at Lotte department store! Coming here was a fun (but tiring- let me tell you that) experience, and I wish go back there soon!"
162,4.0,"It's got everything. If it's raining outside, this makes for a great alternative for something to do. Not wowed, but was well fed and entertained by all the shops and restaurants inside."
163,4.0,Lots of rides and attractions to choose from. 3 times more expensive than what we have in our country but I'd say this is definitely more worth it especially if tou go there early. This is like heaven for kids and kids at heart :) too bad i wasn't able to enjoy the more extreme rides because nobody in my group would like to join me :( it was still a cool experience though
164,1.0,Many rides are closed. Really long waiting time for the included attractions (about 1-2h). Many attraction want another 3000 for entry. Crowded even on weekdays.
165,1.0,"It's so expensive for nearly no rides to take. Rides are indicated with 5min waiting game time like the bumper car, but we waited over a hour. Don't go, wast of time and money..."
166,4.0,"Wonderful place filled with lots of activities for everyone. Kids, teenager, youth and adults. Though Lotte World is not as huge as Disney World and other Theme Parks around the world, it has it's own unique attraction such as the insect world and Folk Museum. For those who are not so keen with the outdoor rides, theme parks there are plenty of shops to go shopping. There is also a indoor parade of cartoon characters for the little ones."
167,5.0,If you want to have fun just go there but make sure you don't go in weekends cuz you will spend a long time waiting in the lines. At 8:30 p.m every day there is a fabulous show don't miss it.
168,5.0,The theme park is awesome! The outdoor and indoor game were so fun 😆 they also sell a lot of yummy food and beverage! It's really cool! Should go there when all of u visit seoul
169,5.0,"Being an American I was not prepared to be awe struck by this mall.  The mall has many western luxury stores, filled with beautiful items.  My favorite floor is the cosmetics and skin care floor, it has western and Korean products. I was able to get my favorite Korean products and it was duty free.  We travelled by subway from Gangham-gu it was a quick ride."
170,4.0,It was nice to have rides indoors and outside.  There is a big ice rink too.  I found it expensive.  When we went into the park some of the rides you had to pay extra for.
171,4.0,"Lotte World reminded me alot of the indoor mall amusement park in Edmonton, Canada.  Very self contained but fun place to people watch the natives having alot of fun. Also food there was expensive..... except for the Lotte fast food place there."
172,5.0,"Let me start this by first saying I'm a HUGE fan of rollercoasters and amusement parks. Ive been to universal, adventure island cedar point, six flags busch gardens and disney all this year. Lotte world was a Great mix of rides, rollercoasters and sights, attractions. There are parts of the park that were a obvious rip off of disneyland. Its located inside of a large shopping complex and right next to a hotel. Its a MUST visit for anyone with children, wanting to have fun on a business trip or just wanting to have something different to do. The Main rollercoaster is a BLAST, and would rival most coasters in any major park. The size of the park and all the things to see and do are amazing and well worth the coast of apprx. $65 per person to go in and ride the rides. you can purchase a $30 ticket but that won't allow you access to the rides. Find the time to spend a few hours you will be glad you did!"
173,2.0,I traveled to south korea with my friend who is a native korean. She and her friends told me it was very popular and good place to go. I thought it was very aged and could do with a little love and care. People pushed in filled with teenagers who checked there hair in the mirror after getting off each ride. Long wait as well. I probably wouldn't go again.
174,4.0,This is the most amazing places i've ever beenWho would have ever thought that there would be a theme park in a mallThe rides were so much fun Its so amazing how much they can fit inside of a mallDefinitely one of the top 10 things to do in Korea
175,4.0,"The lines are so long, but it's worth it. We went there while it was a heat wave, so I can imagine it's much better when you're not having a heat stroke, but it was despite the heat, very fun and something different to do than just go around shopping. We were there the whole day and the night parade was really cool, I would recommend that you see it if you're at lotte world."
176,5.0,"This park was absolutely amazing! I and my friends spent a whole day there to try all the games it has. Roller coaster was most fun and thrilling. At this time of the year, you might have to wait a bit but I don’t mind. Can't wait for a comeback!"
177,3.0,If you level musement park as much as I do you'll really enjoy the inside of the amusement park.  it's also the world's indoor biggest amusement park and it's a lot of fun great rides really great Korean restaurants awesome places to go shopping and it's a great afternoon for wasting time if the weather is bad check it out I enjoy it
178,3.0,"If you're with kids, then this is the best place to visit. But if youre looking for an adult-oriented rides, then Everland is a better pick."
179,5.0,"What a wonderful place to visit.  Great attractions and absolutely love the cuisine.  Its so big I don't think that I got to see half of the attractions.  People from all over the eastern world visit here and what a great way to meet.  No communications issues except when ordering some of the foods, my Korean isn't that sharp but some speak other languages like French, Russian, etc. pick one I suppose but English will suffice for the most part.  Definitely visit the zoo/safari exhibit...the tigers crawled up on our vehicle and they looked a bit hungry!  Absolutely incredible visit - if you're in the area, you should absolutely visit Lotte World!"
180,4.0,"Lotte World has it all, from kiddie rides to rollercoasters to great food. I personally love the street food they have on the way from Adventure to Magic Island. Atlantis and Gyro Drop are my favorites, but they'll require a long, long wait if you choose to visit during the weekend or Korean national holidays."
181,5.0,"This place has all the basic and exciting games; you will enjoy the place its really convenient as its in the city, and you can get there by the subway. there some restaurants close by that you can visit after your great day in this nice place."
182,2.0,I was honestly looking forward to having a lot of fun in Lotte World ever since I arrived in South Korea. I don't know it just didn't quite meet up my high expectation of it since I've seen photos and a documentary about it. The rides were so-so. People made it look thrilling but to me it was a disappointment.
183,4.0,The inside is very cool. A very well made theme park inside and outside. The attractions are also fun but never ever come on weekends if you don't wanna wait 2 hours for every ride. I came on a thursday and the longest time i waited for a ride then was 30 minutes at least. Maybe you should bring some food if you're vegetarian.
184,4.0,We visited Lotte World at the end of our Seoul trip and really enjoyed it.  Aim to get there at opening time as it gets much busier later in the day.  We visited on a week day and managed to fit in around 15 rides (as opposed to Everland where we only did 6 due to long lines).  The food options were quite diverse and reasonably priced.  Lotte World has a quick pass system on some rides so make sure you take advantage of it.
185,4.0,"big amusement park in city center,there is several attraction indoor and outdoor... but its take average 1 hour if you want try each attraction"
186,5.0,"This place is so amazing. As we are on a school trip, we had a tour of the place and after that we had a presentation. After presentation, we had lunch and we were free to enjoy the whole place. Amazingly, theres indoor and outdoor theme park. Due to our schedule, we had only 4hours to explore the whole place. Some rides are really just for kids, u have to choose the right rides. Indoor theres like mirror world, roller coaster, and ice skating ring. Outdoor theres the bigger rides like gyro swing and gyro drop. As with other theme park, there were many people queuing up. For indoors ride, some have this machine where u can get your queue number which theres time on it, u just have to go on that time to get into the ride straight away instead of waiting. Super experience overall, will go back again. youtube - lolsia2000    for videos when im at there"
187,5.0,"I would definitely avoid weekends, national holidays and the day before or holidays. Due to the park's accessibility from the city, it can get super crowded. We started out very early in the morning and queued so that we were one of the first to get in! We bought the discount tickets online (http://funtastickorea.com/shop/lotte-world-ticket-discount/) and collected the ticket at the ticket office by showing our passport. We did the most popular rides in the outdoor first, Gyrodrop, Atlantis and I forget the names... and we were out by 2pm. Although we did want to spend the whole day there, the queues were getting ridiculously long and we wanted to do other stuff on our short vacation."
188,4.0,"Okay, you won't want to compare it with Disneyland; that would be unfair. All rides are not only fun but also very safe, everything is spotless, and the joy of the young Koreans in any car you may end up sharing is contagious, so that counts more than the poor directions to individual rides, the long lines that don't really seem to move very quickly, and the fact that despite buying a full day's pass, you are not allowed to enter and exit more than once. If you want to dine at a restaurant you can see from within Lotte World but cannot access because it is outside, simply insist for re-entrance to be marked on your day pass (for each of you), to ensure re-entry. Access is sufficiently costly that you should automatically have this right: that was how we argued and immediately got re-entry rights.And don't miss the bumper cars! Sure, it's a long wait, but since most of the young adults ahead of you are not yet licensed to drive, it'll be a blast for you because the cars DO respond well when you floor the gas or turn the steering wheel, and you'll have fun livening it up for everybody!"
189,5.0,"I only heard about Lotte World from some Youtube videos. I was so pleasantly surprised that it took less than one hour from Insadong using the metro rail/subway system.  You can buy a day pass, but we got there after 4:00 p.m. so the admission fee was US $17 per person to ride all the rides, and the lines were short.Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland, in California, and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids.  There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor.  I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland.  If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun, this is the place for some roller coaster type rides. This place is not as big as Disneyland in California or even Six Flags Magic Mountain or any of the serious scary rides in the USA.  It reminds me of Ocean Park in Hong Kong."
190,3.0,We went there more for the duty free shopping rather than for the rides. Good for family with kids. Most rides are meant for kids.
191,3.0,"I expected it to be grand and big and beautiful. But it didn't meet my expectables. the outdoor park was just too small. though it contained lots of rides, it look jampacked and it's easy to bump into another person. We went on spring so the surrounding seokchon lake of the outdoor part was very pretty, full of cherry blossoms. But many fun rides on the lake itself are not available. The indoor one is like a mall, there were indeed a lot of rides to do but I don't quite feel the fun coz locating specific rides are a bit confusing, and it felt so gloomy.I really thought i would love lotte world than everland. but everland's definitely awesome."
192,3.0,"please note that the ticket that you purchase is only for one entry.once you went in you cannot come out.there is only one ride that i like.other than that the rest are kids ride. good for family with kid(s) but not for adults.the performance is pretty nice too.however if i were to choose, i rather give up this and go everland another day.I prefer the performance at everland and the souvenir over there too.The food is average over here too."
193,4.0,"During winter it is not nice to go here. The outdoor rides are closed for safety. Though you could still take pictures. There is a photographer in front of the castle, they take polaroid pictures. It's a good souvenir. There's also a parade at 7 or 8 in the evening. It's fun to watch."
194,3.0,"It was interesting with all the rides & games but still I am clueless of what they are saying. Not one of them speaks english from the moment we step into ticketing counter, it's really hard if you don't speaks & understand Korean!!!. We could tried all the rides but we wish they can speaks in english about the safety procedure or how the games works? The last rides we hop on is on B1 level called Wild Adventure. It's totally in Korean language & to my disappointment, I can say I had Five star fun in Ocean Park & Hong Kong Disneyland. I just can't feel the fun, the thrill! That's the biggest setback ever!"
195,3.0,"We went there on a winter so we only explore the indoor park. Not as huge as Universal Studio in Japan or Disneyland in Hongkong but kind of fun and enjoyable especially for the kids and the kids at heart. It is also very accessible since it is connected to a metro station. Also, the COEX mall is one station away so you can do shopping before or after your visit to the Lotte World. If you go there after 4pm, the entrance fee is lesser. One drawback is that you have to pay extra so that you can ride the attractions."
196,5.0,"It is simply a huge complex of stores, restaurants and park. You can find it all inside it and spend a lot of time there. It is also crowded of people, so if you're looking for a relaxing trip, I wouldn't recommend this place. It is well served by the subway and located nearby a lake."
197,1.0,"I have to say we are in korea, with high expectation with the latest technology . Lotte world was a disaster . It look so old like in the mid 80's. Facilities were so old with ages. Have been through with some comments before, people always say lotte world was always crowded and long queue. I figured out why. Unlike Disneyland in Hong Kong or what we done with transformer facilities in Singapore universal studios . They have like lots of machinery that could operates in one time . While in lotte world, for example in the sea adventure , they have only one machine that allows only 12 people at one time. This is wasting time as lots of people are queuing and only 12 at one time??? Wasting time even in a weekday."
198,4.0,"can't help to feel is more like a children theme park as compared to everland... is an excellent choice for half day visit...the waiting time is short roughly 30minutes as compared to everland can reach up to 1 hour 30minutes. Maybe due to the ride for is shorter (maybe is just me) and is in the weekdays....in a way, you get to try different type of things.. do note that you cannot exit the theme park, the ticket is only valid for 1 time entrance. some attraction will require you to show the ticket so keep your ticket safe..."
199,2.0,"If you have been to Disneyland and Universal Studio, you might find this theme park boring and out-dated. We went on 26th dec'14 (Friday) and was crowded and the queue for each ride is an average of 75 mins. It is normal to have a long waiting time if you come to a theme park, but the amount of time queued for the rides we took was not worth it. And some of the attraction are not free, for example the Mirror Maze which was the first attraction we saw, it requires 3,000 won to enter.Rides we took:1) Bumper car (outdoor) - 9 person for each game. Like the usual bumper car at other theme park. Waited 50 mins.2) Wild river - basically is sitting on a vehicle that moves on the spot with a big screen in front to make u feel as though u r traveling on the vehicle. Waited 40 mins.3) Pharaoh's Fury - we queued this thinking that it was the roller coaster ride (should be French Revolution) but this ride is suitable for kids and not for people who likes thrilling rides. Waited 75 mins.4) Dynamic Theatre - is a 4D theatre but no water, wind effect unlike the Shrek 4D at USS. Waited 20 mins.5) Lotty's hot-air balloon flight - we queued for this thinking that is the Hot-air balloon ride (should be Aeronauts Balloon Ride) but is not. This is a 360 degree screen showing hot-air balloon travelling to different parts of the world. Waited 20 mins.We also went to Everland theme park..and felt it's much much better than Lotte world."
200,4.0,"We read a lo of reviews that you have to line up and hour or 2 to ride the attractions. Which is why we planned to take the 4pm pass instead. Our goal was to see the place and the parade and not the rides. When we reached there, we couldn't see what was inside and thought since the place itself is huge (this is one huge shopping centre), we would get the 7pm tickets and wait for the parade at 8.30pm. We had our dinner outside of Lotte World and bought the tickets at 7pm (which is way cheaper), which entitles you to all the rides in there. There were not many people then and we also did not go to Magic Island.For those who only want to see what Lotte World looks like, you can take the hot air balloon ride or the monorail ride. Would suggest the hot air balloon ride, which is about 15 minutes around the indoor park. We only had to wait about 30 minutes for the ride.Then, head on to the center of the park and wait for the parade. You can be on the inside or outside of the path. We headed inside instead since they would close of the place about a few minutes before the parade starts. People wouldn't head inside since the space is limited. Most of the rides close about 10 - 15 minutes before the parade. From what we understand, the staff need to help out at the parade and also, so that you will be encouraged to watch the parade as well.Sit down on the floor (yes, on the floor) and get ready to be awed. We left the place at about 9.30pm.We were there on a weekday and it was not as bad as we thought it would be."
201,5.0,"Lotte World is a super fun and unique theme park located in South Korea. There are indoor and outdoor rides, as well as a concert stage, yummy food, and shopping! there are so many fun rides for all ages. the roller coasters are very fun, and so are the children' rides. The Lotte brand characters are very adorable! I highly recommend going here! If you want a fun and relaxing day in the sun or indoors, Lotte world is the place for you!! Lines were very long on the day i went, but it was worth it! i highly recommend Atlantis and the Gyro Drop and Gyro Swing the most!!!"
202,3.0,"Lotte World is advertised as the World's Largest Indoor Amusement Park. It surely feels like it. The huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight. Having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing. However, Lotte World might not be your best option for entertainment in or around Seoul. Lotte World is straight up inferior to Everland ride-wise, with fewer rides, especially thrill rides such as roller coasters, which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides. So if you're a roller coaster enthusiast, I recommend checking out Everland instead. In addition, the park is 25 years old and feels like it. It doesn't feel quite new, especially for outside attractions. The park's attractions and stores all have this ""slightly off"" color and design that didn't age all too well. Also, the Lotte World now fails in comparison to the building next door, the new 2nd Lotte World complex, which features numerous dining and shopping options, as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the OCDE. Overall, I do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings, but would advise against staying there an entire day. The good thing is that for people who come in rather late in the afternoon, the park offers discounted price, and that's a great value proposition to just come in and enjoy the park for 3 or 4 hours rather than the entire day."
203,4.0,"Visited with my friends on a rainy day,and as i know it is the worlds largest indoor museum.And the first site of the entire panorama inside, it was like a huge colourful park,a carnival,a festival, mountains, fountains, rails ,air balloon,cartoons and much much more.The place is huge and trust me , you cant finish it in a day. And it has everything what is required in an amusement park.The indoor portion in mostly like a carnival going on and i thoroughly enjoyed the rides going through dark caves and water. But the best part of it is the magic island which is in open area and the rides are extremely scary and not for faint hearted :)Do dare to try to highest ride with drops you down like a free fall, plus a round pendulum which oscillates and rotates doubling your scare and the bungee jump plus an extremely scary roller coaster.This place is fun beyond words. :):)"
204,4.0,"I went here twice in December 2011 and January 2013. It was really great! We spent the whole day day bcos there were indoor and outdoor rides! For the pupillary rides, make sure you go early and reserved a queue number. That way, you don't have to queue very long. It's usually limited and only for certain rides. The reservation is always located near the intended ride. Try the gyro drop! I think that's one of the popular ones....sorry but I chickened out. Haha! I came compared this park to everland cos I've never been to the latter :) anyway, you'll enjoy yourself. Just avoid gg on oeak holidays."
205,5.0,"For those who visited Seoul, it is a must for you to visit this amazing amusement park, Lotte World where it's offers a lot of adventerous games and lots of fun! If you facing time constraint, you may go to Lotte World instead of Everland where you can reach there by using the metro line (refer website). You may also enter after 4pm where the price is a lil bit cheaper. But remember to explore all the activities as many as you can before 8pm because they will present you an amazing indoor parade around 8.20pm. All the activities will be temporary stop by then and continue after 9pm.Just enter whatever activities available because you'll be suprise with the games and activities."
206,4.0,"Not the best theme park I visited, but it still offers good fun, plenty of fun attractions, and as always with these kind of theme parks, be prepared to queue. Overall, it was fun. I kinda wish I went to everland instead haha. The good part though is that the theme park connected to lotte mall, which is nice, they have lots variety of foods and interesting food and snacks to buy as souvenirs."
207,4.0,"Similar to Disneyland but in korean version. It's great, fun, wonderful for family and friends. Went there with group tour of 15pax, memories remain forever."
208,3.0,"We went to the Lotte World on Sunday and bought the after 4 special pass tickets since it was cheaper. We pay for only 26,000 won instead of 46,000 won for full day pass. As expected the place was packed with people esp. some local teenagers. Luckily the queueing was acceptable (20-30 mins) for indoor games and we had the opportunity to enjoy almost all of it. However, the queueing was crazy long for the outdoor games (50-90 mins) and we only managed to enjoyed the 'lame' swing tree ride.There is a big carnival parade around the central before the park closed, it was pretty fun with lots of people in colourful costumes dancing around. Overall it was a good place to having fun and pretend you're in Disneyland."
209,4.0,I was excited to visit the place as i love theme parks.. at first i get amazed to the place since its my first time but after our 2nd ride.. i feel bored..could u imagine my friend and I was soooooo sleepy.. seriously.. i feel that this place is more suitable for kids.. Anyway we didnt regret as we got 70% discounted rate.. thanks god..
210,4.0,"Suited more for family with kids, with only limited ride for adults. Do not go during the weekends / public holidays, the crowd is massive. FYI, they give out discount when its rainy days. Do have a look out."
211,5.0,"We went in a group of 22 year old boys, and even so, we enjoyed ourselves greatly. The outside section accommodates much more for older people with some rides only for adults. The outside section is well set out, with most rides a short wait. $46 AUD for a days pass, the park offers an enjoyable day out for all ages. Highly recommended if wanting to find something to do whilst in Korea.We went in the early afternoon (around 12pm) To save wait-times."
212,4.0,"We went on a Saturday and the queues were very long. Magic passes helped. Would probably have enjoyed it more if there were shorter lines for the rides.The ""big thrill"" rides were too brief for me and were over too soon.Didn't bring kids with me this time but kids would really love this place.Good food also."
213,4.0,"It is a good theme park, but for adrenaline junkies like me, don't expect too much. There are only 3 rides worth riding if you like thrill rides. Even those 3 are alright only. I mean, they are fun, but not as scary or thrilling. If you have a low threshold for such rides, it would be ideal. Overall, it's a nice theme park to relax at."
214,4.0,"During my school trip in Jul, 2011 : we spend a  whole day in lotte world. There are many things to discover, it consist of indoor(eg: roller coster) and outdoor activities(eg: riding boat, muzium, artificial hot balloon ride visit). i would highly suggest at least spend a day.Amusement park is great, services is great. They keep smiling and treat us nicely. Not only that here they also got Theater room, can watch 4d,  at night we can see live performance consist of dancing & singing."
215,3.0,"Lotte World is divided into three parts: Lotte World Adventure, Lotte World Waterpark and Lotte World Aquarium. I went to Lotte World Adventure and it consist of four levels of indoor adventures and linked to an outdoor theme park called Magic Island. No doubt some of the rides were the main attractions there but the day went I visited was peak, and it was a Monday. They have two types of tickets, Daily Passport Ticket (full day and after 4pm admission) and Admission Only Ticket (full day, after 4pm and after 7pm admission). It gets cheaper for later passes, I advise you to purchase onsite to prevent any mistakes because it includes admission to some other parts like the museum, where I don't know where it that plus you might be give tourists discounts.During March to April, they feature the Mask Festival where it's a world of fantastic masks along with the vibrant spirit of spring, plus a Masquerade parade at selected timings. The worse part of the trip was most of the rides had to stop at 8pm for fireworks for 30mins. That also means you'll be in the queue before 8pm and queue for 30mins + 1hour or whichever the waiting time for the ride. What frustrates me even more was the staff stopped me from entering and explained to me that there's fireworks but yet allowed Koreans to enter the queue, though there's communication barrier but actions spoke louder than words. That staff even screamed at me as he have to repeat multiple times that I have to wait after 830pm. Bad service!Read up on my Korea trip on http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/08/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-7-coex-mall.html"
216,4.0,We went here last April 2014 and experience an amazing night. This place is actually packed if you visit in the morning which is why we opted for the late afternoon entrance.Ticket is at discounted price in the afternoon and no long queue at the rides. 5 hrs should be enough to go around the place and try lots of rides...
217,4.0,"Lotte World is kind of like a small Disneyland. It has indoor activities as well as an outdoor ""Magic Island"". I went with a group of friends and had a blast. I recommend going on a day where students are unavailable to go, as there are long lines and waiting times for rides and go up to 2 hours long for teenagers and kids on school trips."
218,3.0,It was cool. Not much to say but I found it interesting to go & hangout there for a day.  It was a total spur of the moment thing to do while visiting Seoul.  Def worth checking out!
219,4.0,"A Sunday in october at Lotte World... a pretty decent afternoonMe and my friends went to Korea’s largest indoor amusement park last weekend, and it’s taken me this long to write about it. I’ve been busy… ish. I just checked the brochure and it says that Lotte World is actually the world’s largest indoor amusement park. I believe them.Lotte is one of Korea’s largest corporations – along with Hyundai, Samsung, and others I haven’t bothered to look-up at this moment, Lotte forms part of the “Cheabol” – a group of formidable families that was given the keys to economical re-structuring of the country after the Korean War. Not sure if Lotte is the Fannie or the Freddie in this scenario."
220,2.0,If you like queuing this is the place for you!  We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was way too busy.  On the positive note the staff were really nice.
221,2.0,"Lotte world itself is a pretty cool place... Easy to access via subway, clean, and a lot going on. I personally went for the sole purpose of ice skating though. To start, I was quite dissapointed that I could not use my own skates because they where hockey skates. That was the first time i had ever experienced that, but its a business... The ice was crowded, your not allowed to skate backwards and for the price of admission(about 10,000won) the sheet was poorly maintained. If you are going here to skate, Seoul has WAY BETTER places than this. Check out Mock-dong, Korea University, and I'Park(winter only)."
222,3.0,"It's so great to have an indoor theme park for the chilly winters, but I think that's where the wow factor stops. Lotte World, while fun, is not anything more amazing when compared to it's competitors in other parts of the world. It's fun. I went several times. The rides are comparable to those in other areas."
223,5.0,"I went to Lotte World with 2 of my friends during the late winter in late march. The crowd was seemingly low as it was on a weekday. We went there a few minutes after the opening hours so as to maximise time spent there. However, crowd started flowing in after 5pm with mostly local students as 1). many have ended their lessons in school, 2). the entrance fee is cheaper than a full day entrance ticket (which we bought). So one way to avoid crowd is to visit this theme park on a weekday (preferably from the morning before 5pm) or avoid visiting during the school holidays.As a foreigner & student, I was given discounted entrance fee! Just ask the staff at the ticketing counter for any discount and produce your passport and student ID for validation!"
224,5.0,"I loved going here when i Iived in Korea, the rides are great and its fun for the whole family I wish they had something like it in the States. Part indoor part outdoor, fun no matter what the weather is."
225,3.0,"This would be a good place to go if you have young kids,its more like a small Indoor Disneyland with a lot of rides to enjoy.We were there in Dec 2013 during the winter season and the outdoor Theme Park was closed.There were coachloads of tourists and a lot of local Korean Teenagers  We were there on their winter holidays and it was crowded.We had to queued for 90 mins to take the balloon ride.Most of the rides were crowded and the queue was long.As with all attractions go during weekdays,not on weekends and holidays.Many shops and eateries line the walkway and you can practically spend the whole day inside this place."
226,4.0,"I HATE amusement parks, usually all the rides are too-strong for me and I get scared. But the rides in Lotte World aren't that bad for me, I got to enjoy them with minimum fear. I guess that's bad for people who enjoy truly-thrilling rides, but it's perfect for the ones that don't enjoy them that much!I went around every ride, and it was pretty fun. But the ones I wanted to go the most, were not included in the ticket price, so I didn't even go... :( The rides that are not included are the scary houses and the mirror maze. This is a great place for kids, they have special events for them every twenty minutes, with great and funny performances that they will enjoy! :) At night, they have an awesome performance with lots of foreign entertainers! I assure you, you will have fun!!The food inside the park is not cheap (it's not suuuuuper expensive, but I recommend you to snack inside, and eat outside).TIPS: -If you use Kakaotalk, add Lotte World as a friend. You can get a great discount by that! My ticket was only 11,000KRW, instead of the usual 40,000KRW! They have special events going on around the year, you should keep an eye on that!-If you go with a friend from the opposite sex, get the couple discount in everything! You will save a lot of money, and you will eat more in the restaurants!"
227,3.0,"The amount of couples that I saw here were unbelievable, it is more a dating site more than anything. There seemed to be a lot of school children there as well, needless to say the place was packed and queues for the rides were at least 40 minutes each (the more popular ones, well over an hour). I only had time to go on the Balloon Sky Ride which did give me a chance to take some nice pictures. It is a pretty place and I think you should go for the sake of saying you've been there, done that. However one time is enough."
228,5.0,"Find a non-busy time and go right away. We bought after 4pm tickets for very cheap, 15,000 won and were there for a solid 4-5 hours. The indoor rides are pretty good but the one outside are better. The tall drop was a favourite as it went 25 stories into the air and had extremely great views of the surrounding city."
229,5.0,"A great indoor place to visit if you really want to visit Everland but hate the cold. This is really fun and awesome replacement for the Everland theme park. The staff is okay, the games and the rides are super exhilarating and super fun (probably because this is my first time visiting a theme park) nd the price is reasonable. For a one day pass, i can try all the games and rides for free except for three games. Will absolutely visit it again."
230,5.0,"In the winter time or hot summer season, you may feel difficult to go around outside even though you are in great theme park. Lotte world has indoor theme park so we don't worry about the weather at all. One thing you should consider before you go there, Lotte world has super duper long queue in the most of time...so If you want to enjoy a ride something you better be prepared of long waiting."
231,3.0,Good combination of indoor and outdoor activities.  But the long queueing time and average thrill rides make this a rather old and tired attraction.  Have seen better rides in recent times and Lotte World seriously needs an upgrade.But the location is easily accesible from Jamsil station and provides a nice getaway for tourists who prefer not to take the long 2-hour journey to Everland
232,2.0,"Never thought an amusement park could be this boring... Q over 60min for rides and the crowd was just over floating.Shows are all in Korean so it's hard to understand what's going on, not very English friendly.My advise is to go there if you really run out of places to visit in Seoul."
233,3.0,+Nice atmosphere.Wide variety of rides from different age groups.-Most of the indoor rides require additional fees on top of entrance fee.Old-looking and not much changes from my visit 5 years ago.
234,4.0,"Lotte world has the largest indoor theme park and located in the heart of Seoul at Jamsil Station. It has many attractions and rides as well but it's always crowded even on weekdays. I like the thrilling rides at the magic island, outdoor theme park like the Gyro Drop. Overall it's fun and more suitable for younger children and teens. I went to everland and Lotte world during my trip and I personally prefer Everland to Lotte world. Not that Lotte world is bad but Everland cater to more ages. If you visit my profile, jacqsowhat.blogspot - you will find more details about lotte world and everland! xx"
235,4.0,"If you visit my profile here you will find more detail about Lotte World including video and pictures. There is plenty to do at Lotte World, if there is rainy weather it's okay because there is plenty to do indoors. Theres rides for all ages, from kids to adults. One thing to note is see if there is language translation options as most of all the stories that you listen to while lining up are all in Korea, so be mindful of that. Be mindful that the front entrance ticket does not cover every ride there are some such as the horror house that cost a little more."
236,3.0,"It could've fun and much more thrilling if I were a kid. But since I've grown up too much, I appreciate thriller rides better. Though the park boosts of some rides (ie. bungee drop & gyro drop) the other rides were an ok. It could've been better should I arrived at the park when all the rides are available for us and not under maintenance."
237,5.0,"As an American Serviceman stationed in Korea, this place was a welcome refreshing break from my everyday duties. My buddies and I would go down and experience this phenomenal Amusement Park. If you are ever in Korea and want a great day of fun, check this place out, you wont be disappointed."
238,2.0,"Lotte World looked better at first sight than it actually was. First we arrived and had to pay 44000Won for a full day ticket. My friend got a credit card discount and the ticket costed him 12 000Won, it would be nice to know about those kind of discounts. We got disappointed because the ticket itself wasnt a full pass, you need to grab at least 30 000Won more to access everything in Lotte world such as Ice ring, Magic jungle, Horror house (or something like that). The amusement park rides looked pretty old from near distance, also there wasn't many of them altogether. Maybe 5-8 rides for an adult. We skipped the rollercoaster right away because of 45min queue. There were two nice rides, so I wont give 1 star."
239,5.0,"Lotte World is one of the most thrilling and unforgettable experience I could think of and relish. I have been to almost all theme parks in India but my experience at Lotte World was whole new different. Right from the entrance till the last ride (available) was breath-taking and awesome. The Roller coaster, Bungee drop & Giant loop was very frighteningly good but even better was the Gyro drop & Gyro spin (which literally threw us to the lake nearby :-) I am pretty sure kids of all ages would definitely love the place and parents would have a hard time getting them back home ;-)Unparalleled fun & excitement guaranteed!"
240,3.0,This was a great place to go with friends if you are looking for some fun rides.  Watch for $ specials.  Using a particular bank credit card can score you some savings!
241,3.0,"Lotte world is nice theme park, but not the best in my opinion. Of course, indoor part looks fancy and nice, but it's nothing to be ""wow"" for a lifetime.There are many nice attactions and the staff is really friendly, but going there is kind of tiring too.I went there on a weekday and in the afternoon, so it wasn't that crowded yet, but we still waited 30-50 minutes for each attraction. It's not much at all, some people are waiting for few hours during weekends!Also, use your discounts. If you are subscriber on KakaoTalk or share their page on facebook you can get a bigger discount. Because ""foreigner discounts"" are kinda funny.All in all, I liked it there, but I wouldn't go there again in a short period of time. Maybe someday later.."
242,4.0,"The first impression was... well, impressive. The indoor theme park was somewhat mind blowing and really pretty. The Magic island is a nice addition with better rides for adults. We went to visit on a national holiday and in the evening, so there were Korean couples everywhere - Lotte World a popular dating spot. You can get quite cheap tickets after 7pm, especially if you don't want to ride anything. It's a bit boring without rides because the park is in the city and thus quite small."
243,4.0,"We were there last few days during our Summer Exchange Programme. Got our one-day passes with discounted price 35,200 won each since we had the special vouchers.It was Sunday and super crowded. Waiting time for a ride could be up to more than 80 minutes. Anyway, it was still fun!We spent our morning session on outdoor games. Over there, there was a type of service so called Magic Pass, was like a reservation you could make for only certain rides by scanning your entrance ticket at the Magic Pass Counter.It was a sad case, we didn't manage to try all the rides because we needed to rush back to our university on time. If you're okay with the height, I shall strongly recommend you to give GYRO DROP a try. It raised us up to the sky-high and dropped us to the ground within 2 seconds. It was a super duper exciting zero-gravity experience ride! Don't worry about the queue. Not many people trying it, and it could takes a lot of riders each time.The other one would be ATLANTIS ADVENTURE. It wasn't like normal roller coaster which takes you to certain height first, and let the momentum of falling to speed the coaster up. It was moved at a very fast speed all the time. We didn't have gap to catch a breath after each turning over or loop! It was just so scary yet fun!One more thing don't miss the performances happen indoor if you were there. The musical show was just so unforgettable to me. Awesome dance with funny scripts!"
244,3.0,"Lotte World makes a good place to kill time and is also popular with young student groups or dating couples. The rides are not as exhilarating as those you would expect from a Japanese or Australian theme park. The indoor area rides are catered more for children to teenagers. Outdoor area is not as big as what a first timer would expect and is more for adults rides. If you wish to hit only some rides before you leave, I would recommend the Atlantis as even people with lower threshold would appreciate. The Gyro series maybe a tad bit intimidating for the weak hearted."
245,4.0,"Been there on my recent Summer trip in August. Was there from abt 11am -9.30pm.It was a rather gloomy morning with slight drizzle, so it wasnt too crowded.Took the Gyro Drop and Alantis* (outdoor rollercoaster) with a 15min queue. Then watch some ""K-pop"" highschool musical show and some parade.The crowd started streaming in after lunch hour and queues started to form.Took the French Revolution* (indoor roller coaster) after a 45min queue.then roamed around more, took ALL the rides we passed by and left after the Laser Show.* these rides are the most worth it if you're into highspeed twist and turns... if you scream during a viking ride... you should give them a miss... lol..."
246,5.0,I visited here with eunhyang my korean friend and I had a awesome time jam packed of fun and laughter went on all the rides the big 1 I remember looking around thinking wowezer then I heard the click and down we went I am not sure where my tummy went but hey what a frill! it was blazing hot when i was there so standing over the ice rink was much welcomed although I did fancy giving it ago but I didn't want to break my neck! haha
247,5.0,"My experience was great, I really enjoyed the attractions specially that huge tower that swings you around. The food was not so good and I was surprised to see for the first time korean Churros. The staff was friendly and Ill return there next year."
248,5.0,"Went to Lotte World with a friend during a weekend. To get there, just take the metro to 'Jamsil'. It was crowded and there was party atmosphere everywhere. The place is loaded with cartoon characters, and there are live performance shows everywhere.The roller coaster is a must-take ride here. Also don't miss the Flume ride and Gyro drop. I felt the Gyro Drop is the best attraction in Lotte World."
249,5.0,"natco holidays review - I have visited Seoul through one Malaysian tour company namely natco holidays last December. I am Korean and I was quite shocked because of its price being offered as it was indeed more cheaper than the one being offered in Korea.anyways, my itinerary was in this way:Seoul - Mt.Sorak - PyeonChang - LotteWorld - Seoul - Seoul.I brought my friends from Malaysia, and they really loved it.At Lotte world, there are many amusement equipment. One of my favorite was hurup ride (후룹라이드) which you can take picture (actually, you will be taken a picture without noticing the existence of camera, lol) while you are falling from some high place.The funny thing was, you will be shamed on yourself once you see the picture of yourself. hehe, anyways, overall, i liked lotte world very much. A loooooooooooot  of things to enjoy!That is must-go place in SEOUL!!!!The accommodation was quite nice~ and the meals were also quite nice~ The meals are very nice to eat like Running man TV show~However, it was sooooo cold when we went to PyeongChang. So i recommend you guys to wear warm especially in December ~ Feburary."
250,4.0,"I spent a few weeks in Seoul and visited Lotte World twice. Both times I went after 6 PM and paid a very cheap entrance, can't remember how much, but it was worth it. I didn't encounter long lines, and was able to manage the fast pass option in many rides, which made it easier. I had more fun than in many other amusement parks, including Disneyland Paris. Highly recommended."
251,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, Lotte World is a must place that you want to visit. There you can can spend full day with a wonderful thrilling rides and theater plus nice facilities."
252,3.0,"This indoor theme park wasn't as big as I thought it would turn out to be. We went in after 4pm as the tickets were slightly cheaper. They also had tickets for general admission which are cheaper but doesn't allow you to ride the rides inside the theme park. We bought the ticket that allowed us to ride rides as we thought that it would grant us admission to all rides in the amusement park. But apparently that wasn't the case. We still had to pay extra 3000 won for quite a number of the attractions we wanted to visit. One example was their horror show. We ended up not going inside because we refused to pay the extra fee. Also, as a major tourist attraction in Seoul, I would have expected the place to be a little more tourist friendly. When my friend and I went to ride their 4D motion master, all the instructions given were in Korean and we had to follow what the others were doing before we know what we supposed to do. Overall, this place wasn't as awesome as I thought it'd be, but it's still a good place to take pictures."
253,3.0,"The attraction itself is fine, seems like a great place for kids. We went on a rainy day as three male teenagers. All except one outdoor ride was closed, which limited our options of rides. We got there in the morning, and the lines weren't more than 15min wait. Would recommend getting there around 10. Food wise, there were tons of places to buy churros, hot dogs, corn dogs, and other carnival style food. You also could get western, Korean, and Chinese food. Relative to the other places in Seoul, they were surprisingly inexpensive for being at an attraction. I paid about 7,000 KW for a pizza. Overall, we would recommend it if you don't go on a rainy day. We liked how close it was, and the price was reasonable."
254,4.0,"I’ve seen the Everland vs. Lotte World debate rage on in Trip Advisor, and while I haven’t been to Everland, after seeing Lotte World I think the choice really depends on what you want to get out of going there. Just to put this review in context, I am not a kid; I went to Lotte World because the friend I travelled with (also an adult) really wanted to go to an amusement park in Seoul. We chose Lotte World because it was within Seoul and didn't want to bother with a long bus ride. Since it was cold in March, a climate controlled amusement park seemed like the best choice. I’ve been to a bunch of amusement parks and consider Disneyland to be the world standard. By comparison, Lotte World is on the small side, but just as well-maintained and not too far off in terms of quality. The big difference is Lotte World will not have the advantage of other major amusement parks, which feature rides that are based on popular cartoons and blockbuster movies. It would be weird expecting the same kind of experience, when Lotte World doesn't have anything iconic like Sleeping Beauty or Harry Potter.But what you do get are:1. Thrills -- The scary rides were scary enough to elicit genuine screams from me. The staff was very conscious about checking safety belts and bars, so that was very encouraging. Note though, that some rides were lame (the 3D ones didn’t have the best story lines).2. Value -- The 40,000 KW adult day pass is only 28,000 KW for foreigners. The kid passes are even cheaper (these are adult prices). A full-price ""after 4 PM"" pass is 25,000 KW so there’s no reason to go there late to save money, unless you want to spend only 25,000 KW or less. Note though, that some of the attractions are not covered by the full-day passport. We didn't bother going to those places.3. Location – Lotte World is beside a really excellent shopping mall (which has an amazing food court, supermarket and a bunch of shops), connected to the Jamsil metro station, and within Seoul.My own tips from having spent about 6 hours there are:1. Timing – We went on a weekday morning while it was about 5 degrees Celsius so the lines were not long until 2 PM. I’d come here early if I were in it for the rides.2. Still on Timing -- If you want to eat breakfast at Lotte Department Store before heading in, the good places don’t open until 10:30 AM. This means that if you want to get into the park when it opens at 9:00 AM, your only food choices and Krispy Kreme, Lotteria (McDonald’s wannabe fast food place), and eating in the park.3. Food – Obviously, this isn’t some Michelin-starred place so expect ordinary fare in the park in terms of taste. There are a number of food choices in terms of variety (Korean food, Chinese food, American/Western food, coffee shops, candy stores) so if you aren’t picky, you’ll surely find something to munch on.4. Culture – They have a folk museum with massive dioramas featuring Korean history. If you’ve seen this, you can skip the Folk Museum at Gyeongbokgung and find the teddy bear version in N Seoul Tower even more amusing.I researched this at length before going so I’ll just pass on what I read in other posts:1. The full-day pass is single entry, so some folks had a hard time coming back in after leaving the park to have lunch elsewhere. You have to negotiate re-entry.2. Lines can get really long, like an hour or so per ride, so I junked any desire to save money and showed up at 10 AM. With the foreigner discount, it wasn’t bad at all.---I recommend this place to people who aren’t too picky about amusement park features, drama addicts who’ve seen Lotte World on the small screen, and those who can manage expectations about how fun a fun place can be."
255,2.0,Decided to go for Lotte World as it is at a more convenient location compared to Everland. It was a bad decision. The rides were boring/ordinary...not worth the time or money.
256,4.0,"I been here more than 10 time and i still love it, come during Spring time which is April - May.. you will have beautiful view over the lake side."
257,3.0,I'd suggest anyone everyone to just head to Everland if you have a day to spare in a theme park. Me and my friends we spent the whole day in Everland without getting bored and amazed but it was purely zzz throughout our stay at Lotte World. It's small and there's nothing much to see. Just felt that Lotte is overrated. Everland is just so much better! (okay it took us hours to get to Everland from Seoul so I guess if you want convenience Lotte World will be a better choice) Spent not more than 4 hours in Lotte World before we head out haha. If I didn't remember wrongly the ticket was cheaper than Everland though! And they gave us student price despite us being foreigners (and we did not have student pass with us?!) and some meal voucher which we exchanged for a free meal yay! Haha so we didn't felt that bad afterall.
258,2.0,"Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed, at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic. We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us. Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased. We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well. Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything. The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday. The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience."

It had never been on an inside ride before, so that was a novelty. The inside water ride wasn't actually that bad, but you will get wet. Outside is the place to be for the roller coasters. The Gyro Swing was great, but if you have motion sickness, it's not for you! The bumper cars are awesome.The Atlantic Adventure is a proper coaster, but be prepared for a really long line. If you can, definitely go on a week day. I had a really unique and fun experience. Make sure to look online for discounts for foreigners, couples, or for a night pass."
260,3.0,regular tourist theme park with indoor and outdoor..super long queues for almost everything including food (even though we had lunch at 3pm which by right lunch rush hour should be gone). U'll need to spend the whole day there to play most of the rides and explore the mall etc.. there's a avenue of stars beside though..
261,5.0,"I spent a great day in Lotte world with my friend .. from 4 pm till 10 pm we really enjoyed the different adventures there, specially Gero swing, Atlants, Ice skating and the amazing international performances on the Garden stage.I hope to can visit it again :D"
262,3.0,"This is a fun park. I went several times while stationed in Korea. It does get very busy so be prepared to wait for rides and such. There are always concerts you can sit down and watch if you get burnt out on the rides. It is fun just to walk around and look at everything. I noticed being an american many of the koreans wanted to be helpfull and would make you go in front of them in line, which of course I did not turn down."
263,4.0,"Lotte World is a lot of fun. There is an outside and inside portion. The queues can be long, but Atlantis is definitely worth the wait. Best ride ever! Just so you know, there is a birthday discount. I think it has to be within a month of your birthday. If you show ID to prove it, you can get the discount. My friend did that for us. :)"
264,5.0,"Iv already been to Lotte World twice this year..It's 1 of the reasons why I want to come back to Seoul more!The Theme Park itself has an outdoor & an indoor area with thrill rides..What sells it for me is the ""Foreigner Discount"" ... you end up saving around 5000 won each & they even gave us free beer coupons for the outdoor cafe! where we proceeded to get free chips from a lady sitting right next to us!!It was AWESOME!!"
265,4.0,"Lotte World is a decent way to spend a day in Seoul.  There are plenty of cultural and historical attractions in this mammoth city, but if you just want to shop, eat, and have fun on rides, this is a good place.  The indoor amusement park is not the best, but it's entertaining.  There is also an ice rink in the bottom that is pretty fun too."
266,4.0,"Although Lotte World wasn't on the top of our list of places to visit during a week-long stay in Seoul, on our last day in Seoul, we realized that we had seen all of the other sights and decided to check out Lotte World.  While we were at the Insadong Information Center a few days earlier, I picked up a Lotte World flyer that had a coupon for foreigners that we used (apparently they have discounts for foreigners all the time -- it's worth asking about a discount at the ticket counter or ask one of the very nice volunteers at any of the Tourist Information Centers in Seoul). If you've been to Disneyland or Disney World's Magic Kingdom you'll quickly realize that the look and feel and even the rides at Lotte World is trying to be a wannabe Disney park.  For example, there was ""Sindbad"" ride was very much like Pirates of the Caribbean, the castle at Magic Island looks like Cinderella castle in Magic Kingdom, Pharoah's Fury has the same jeep-looking vehicles as Indiana Jones, and the list goes on.  We found the imitation of the Disney parks amusing and endearing.  In comparison Lotte World is very small and has less rides but you also pay less for admission.  We went on some rides and would have gone on a few more if the lines weren't so long.  We visited on a Friday and it seemed crowded with lots of school kids and kindergarteners.    If you're not into rides they also have shows and a parade and a very good Folk Museum where you can learn all about the origins and history of Korea and the lives of Koreans during different periods. Museum placards were in Korean and English.  We probably spent an hour and a half in the museum and could have spent more time if we wanted to read and learn more.  The miniature village is pretty cool too.    Overall we enjoyed Lotte World and were happy that we spent some time there!  If I go to Seoul again I don't know that I would make it a point to go to Lotte World a second time, but it was fun and interesting to see what the world's largest indoor amusement park looked like and to experience a Korean amusement park."
267,5.0,It's a nice place to go for shopping and eating but may not be interesting for foreigners as you may feel strange! Lots of people may not understand what you are asking for..so better use slow motion English...
268,5.0,"Have been here a few times, it's a great place!It's half inside/half outside, and there are lockers available for rent.Lines can be really long, especially on weekends. They have some pretty good rides.There's a skating rink and loads of restaurants to choose from!There used to be a gun range, but it's no longer open.It's funny to see 90% of the people there walking around with silly animal ears on (about 5,000 for a pair..Available all over the place).There are discounts available...You can check there website for info, it's all there in English...Or you could probably just ask when you arrive. Different discount cards can get you significant discounts as well.A fun place to spend a day!"
269,5.0,This is amazing place. Koerans showed how creative they are. They created a theme park half indoor and half outdoor. Indoor theme park itself is big enough to cover a full day. It is many times better than Disney Paris. We got a foreigner discount of 30%. Just ask before taking the ticket.  (Check in information center before taking ticket for discount coupon)
270,4.0,"Lotte World is large thame park either indoor or out door for kids & teens included aldult to have    to have fun & release tension.The entrance fees is around 40,000 thousand Won.It takes full days to complete all games fun and show when we visit.We can take ballon ride, ship swing train ride and others indoor & out door games.If we are lucky our kids can see mickey mouse show. Consider don't miss to visit this enjoyable place & do some shopping although we need to spend our money but it worth for the value."
271,3.0,"The best part was the price.  I went in the afternoon and it was cheaper, plus my bank card gave me another 40% off.  Lotte World is small and the lines are super long.  There was only one good ride and we had to wait about four hours to ride it.  The name is called Atlantis and it does rock.  If you want an all day theme park then Everland is more worth your money."
272,4.0,"during my visit to Korea i have visitted this place twice. it is great place to treat the child inside of you. great rides. at 7pm they have amzing parade in indoor side of the world and if you need a deal, they have better rates in the afternoon. Dont miss the star avenue, they have great audio rooms, you can put your voice over your favorit dramas."
273,4.0,"Worth visiting if you have a free day in Seoul.  The rides were amazing, especially the reverse bungee and the gyrobomb.  5 seconds of pure weightlessness.  The Viking ride was also rather extreme, going almost vertical."
274,4.0,We was there after 4pm becos the entrance ticket is alot cheaper and we have no plan of staying there the whole day.
