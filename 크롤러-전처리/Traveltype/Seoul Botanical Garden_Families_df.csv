1,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I visited the botanical garden. It has opened relatively recently at far western end of Seoul. The glasshouse is designed like a lotus leaf and quite beautiful itself. You can walk a sky-bridge and see plants from above too.

3,5.0,"I just visited last Sunday and truly enjoyed myself. It’s a close walk from the station and it was easy to get there from south Seoul by the express train. The garden itself is lovely...and nicely decorated. Divided into various country areas with some fascinating plants and fruit trees. It’s still quite new, so the place inside as well as outside the restaurant feels fresh and nicely kept. Walking around the greenhouse garden made me really happy. It’s a nice place for a date too. There are spaces to explore within the building attached to it and I found interesting displays. Furthermore, there are other nature areas outside attached to the garden such as wetlands which I didn’t explore because I spent around 3 hours within the botanical garden and later had a nice meal in the 6th floor. There is a korean cafeteria and a Italian/fusion restaurant. I had herb bibimbap and it was really good. I’d like to go back here again and explore outside areas next time. As I can only attach 10 photos here, more pictures are on my Instagram @katfuz"
