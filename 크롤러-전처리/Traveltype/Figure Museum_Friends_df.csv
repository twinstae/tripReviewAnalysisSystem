The entry fee was covered by the Discover Seoul pass.Once inside we went to the top of the building and made our way down the myriad of displays in the building. I quite enjoyed them because they were mostly ones which I recognise and like, including Marvel, DC, Gundam, DBZ and One PIece.I really enjoyed taking my time just looking at all the different figurines on display, particularly the life sized ones like the Hulk Buster. The vault on the top floor was also quite cool since you can check on the screen in front of you for details of the figurines. The only problem was that it got a bit hard to see the ones near the top and edges.After the browsing, you can buy some stuff yourself at the shop by the entrance."

Walk pass Starbucks then turn left into a side street, you will see big figures right outside the museum. A few stories in this museum (each floor is quite small). Perfect family outing spot!! Kids will love it~ All the Hollywood hero figures!! Some of the figures are HUGE!! Lots of photo opportunity.There is small gift shop when you first walk in the museum. Don't forget to go to basement too. More figures~"
