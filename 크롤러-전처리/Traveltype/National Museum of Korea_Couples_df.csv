0,5.0,one of the best museums in Seoul.  Very easy to find get off at Ichon Subway stop on the blue line three stops from Seoul Station. the exhibits are constantly changing and they occasionally have international exhibits - I saw the hermitage exhibit and the Muesum d'Olreans Paris museum. very resasonable fees
1,2.0,"It is Korea’s National museum and it’s a nice building with a few genuine national treasures, but it falls a bit flat.  It seems too sparse and many of the English descriptions are poorly done or entirely absent.  It also does not flow well and there were only a few really memorable exhibits. The Leeum Samsung museum is much better."
2,5.0,We came here after visiting the Korean War Museum so we were pretty tired and still very jet lagged. This is a beautiful museum and I wish we would have taken more time to explore but we were just so exhausted! Worth seeing still.
3,5.0,"This museum is adjacent to the Gyeongbokung Palace, so it's very convenient to visit. There's a cafe in the basement for light refreshments. A comprehensive display of the Joseon Dynasty that lasted for 5 centuries. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon."
4,5.0,We visited the museum while staying in Seoul. It is very well laid out and the displays are simply beautiful.  Amazing that so much history has been preserved and acquired for people to see.Was particularly pleased to see so many school groups there.
5,5.0,Great museum and best of all it's free! Extensive Asian collection. They even have little robots for help if needed. Worth a day no matter the weather!
6,5.0,"Well organized, nice exhibition in a vibrant building. It is not ovecrowded even on a rainy day. Free entry is a plus."
7,5.0,We love to visit National Museums when we have the opportunity. With only 2 days in Seoul we had to choose carefully how to spend our time. We are so happy that we began our first day at the National Museum of Korea. The displays were nicely presented with narrative in English which gave us insights and information to better understand Korea and the Korean people. This large and airy museum includes a 10 story pagoda. The directional flow from room to room is logical and easy to follow. Our 3 hour visit was fabulous. We highly recommend making the time to visit this excellent museum.
8,2.0,"Building itself is impressive. Exhibition boring and way too large, feels like you have seen these same green vases so many time. Seems to be popular amoung school groups. Children running around and acoustics make place noisy ."
9,5.0,A great insight into Korean history.  It has a wonderful display of ceramics.  We had lunch at the restaurant which was delicious.  A must see place to visit in Seoul.
10,5.0,After visting the site of thombs  and their contents at the Gyeongju Ancient Tomb Complex we when to the  musuem to gain more knowledhe of the Shilla People.The displays wete excellent and had descritions in English. Excellent!
11,5.0,"It may not be quite as interesting as the War Museum (the best free museum in Korea), but it does get the silver medal. Great way to spend a few hours out of the sun or rain and when the weather is right, enjoy the large park outside. In fact the park is superb... mini-rivers and waterfalls, play area for kids, lots of green space and trees - great way to relax. Highly recommended... a very cheap day out!"
12,5.0,"I went there a few times and I really like it. They have a huge collection, including lots of porcelain. The museum itself is very spacious so be prepared for at least 2 hours of visiting. There’s a small park - like right outside the museum. And the entrance is free of charge.Sometimes they organize events for foreigners, like for eg making korean masks - only that costs extra"
13,4.0,"What a beautiful museum, and it is located within a short stroll of a subway station. Even though I am not well informed as to Asian history and artifacts, the museum is definitely worth a stroll -- and since admission is free, there is little risk for the benefit of expanding one's artistic exposure."
14,5.0,"Beautiful Museum with excellent displays of Korean Culture and History.  Admission is free, and it can be accessed either through the Palace grounds or a separate entrance.  Take the time to tour and visit."
15,5.0,We are great fans of museums. This being said this Seoul museum is at the top of the pile. We usually. Is it from the top down ( fewer people do the upper ranges) and only completed the 2nd and 3rd floors in 3 hours.Th displays are well thought. Our highlight of a 7 stay in Seoul.
16,3.0,"The National Museum of Korea has a great amount of exhibits about the korean history. Even though the museum is free of charge and offers an app to get english explanations about some of the exhibits on your one cell phone not everything is explained. If you are not very familiar with korean history you'll easily get bored. But the place is worth s visit just because of the beautiful landscape, the architecture and the view of the N. Seoul Tower from the south."
17,5.0,"From the elegant building itself to the depth of the collections to the attention to guest comfort - this is a world class museum.  The displays (all with English signage) provide a sampler of the history and culture of South Korea.  There are several places to eat both inside the museum and outside but on the museum grounds. Each floor has a couple sets of rest rooms, and places to sit and rest. As for getting there, subway access is easy; from the maps I saw, I was concerned we might have to walk across a large parking lot to get from the subway to the museum, but not so; there is a direct underground tunnel from the subway to the museum entrance plaza; although some walking is involved, it's comfortable and quiet."
18,4.0,"Histories from centuries ago was well presented. common visitors like us (without any historical background) could follow through the era, and understand the evolution of korean civilisation. We missed the guided tour as there was no english tour on Monday."
19,4.0,"This place is huge so unless you have all day, you need to be selective.  Go to the Information desk on arrival. They will help you download an App with a description of most of the exhibits and if you have your passport or drivers licence with you, they will loan you ear plugs. Then it’s off for a wander.  We thought the Museum shops were reasonably priced and far better quality than the tourist stuff for sale in Seoul generally. There are plenty of very clean toilets and café’s to make your visit comfortable. Easily accessible on the underground, well worth a visit, lots to see."
20,5.0,"The building housing the National Museum of Korea is, quite simply, stunning; it is worth visiting the museum just to admire the architecture alone - a wonderful example of modern design fitting perfectly into it's environment.Entry to the permanent exhibitions of the museum is free and brief guides are provided in a number of languages.Across the concourse from the permanent exhibition halls is that used for Special Exhibitions, for which there is a charge.  We didn't visit the special exhibition.Within the permanent exhibitions there really is too much to take in on one visit and so we decided to concentrate on ceramics and pottery.  In a nutshell, the First Floor covers Prehistory and Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History; the Second Floor exhibits Calligraphy and Painting and Donated Works and the Third Floor, Sculpture and Crafts and Asian Art.Exhibition halls are spacious, high ceilinged and well laid out.  The areas flow into each other and sometimes there is a 'lounge' off the hall.  There were lots of school parties there when we visited and there was plenty of space for the children to sit on the floor with their leaders and discuss what they had seen.  The space here is enormous, it's hard to describe.There are at least two museum shops - good quality souvenirs, notebooks etc and one shop concentrating on offering discounts on items from previous exhibitions.There are good toilet facilities on each floor and a number of places in which to eat and drink.  We relaxed at the Tea Rooms, enjoying a delicious ginger tea.Given more time, I think we might have taken an English language tour - there are six per day, four in the morning and two in the afternoon.  The museum has a good website, so am sure that details could be found there.After you have finished in the museum, take a wander through the grounds until you come to the Pagoda Garden, worth a look.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, it felt like a real privilege to see it and share in it.  We would thoroughly recommend a visit."
21,5.0,"The Korean history over the last 3000 years was very well documented and displayed at the museum.I was very impressed with the spirits of Koreans over the millennias, overcoming various adversities and human calamities! It’s adoption of Confucianism was critical for the development of the Korean Empire over the centuries. I was very surprised that the last dynasty of Korea lasted for more than 900 years, much longer than any dynasties in China the longest of which was about 500 yearsThe museum is also conveniently located near metro station.A must visit for all visitors who want to get a sense of the historical importance of Korea."
22,4.0,"It's huge! You can see many historical artefacts, findings, collections, and learn about history, olden days culture and the tradition ways of korea. They have new exhibitions too."
23,5.0,"Easy to go to as there is an access from the train station. Extensive collection of historical artifacts. I learned a lot. Download the app for an English guide, which was so helpful. Visit their garden around the museum."
24,4.0,"This was a nice place to spend a rainy morning. The galleries are manageable in size, and the collection is impressive."
25,5.0,"A beautiful building, with plenty of areas to rest and recharge. There is so much to see and learn about Korean history.  Nice displays, although some were dark.  The donated collections were impressive. The grounds are a wonderful respite from city living."
26,5.0,"The museum is located near subway Ichon station. It is a modernized museum with gardening surroundings. The admission fee of the special exhibitions are around 6000, but the permanent exhibitions are free of charge, and they are worthwhile enough to visit.  You can see well-organized artifacts of Korea throughout the history. There are also many precious artifacts from other areas, such as China, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. And the special exhibitions are of even better experience. We visited the the Joseon Dynasty Maps exhibition, which showed the history of Korean people making maps of Korea and even the whole world. The exhibition is very well-organized with many technological designs. You could scan the code to see the AR effects of the map with your mobile phone. Many local people found the places they were familiar with in the ancient map. The visitors were really having fun!"
27,5.0,"We were super impressed with the National Museum of Korea. There are so many good points to list: - Beautiful, interesting artifacts chronicling Korean history - Well laid out - Gorgeous contemporary building, very spacious - Excellent English translations - Free entry - Open late some nightsWe spent two hours here. We saw all of the first floor (Korean history) then did a very quick lap of the second & third floors. The grounds really are gorgeous!"
28,4.0,If you are into Culture and Heritage it is ok. The visit can be combined with a visit to the palaces in the area.
29,5.0,This is a huge complex with many interesting exhibitions. Highly recommend. You need a few hours to really soak it all in.
30,5.0,Great museum to spend time in. It has interesting exhibits to look at and we could spend hours in there.
31,4.0,"This museum was on our list to visit while we were in Seoul and we were so glad we did. It was easy to get to by local bus which stops right opposite the main entrance. The building is stunning and beautifully designed, spacious and filled with natural light, and the gardens and mirror pool are equally impressive. We were too early for autumn colour but the trees should be even more beautiful in a couple of weeks.The museum is free so it was busy with many groups of schoolchildren visiting on the day we went. But there are 3 floors with many exhibition rooms so it’s easy to avoid the crowds. The exhibits include periods of Korean history from prehistory to the Korean empire and sections covering traditional Korean crafts. There are also sections covering Asian art from China, Japan, Central Asia and India. It’s easy to spend a couple of hours here. We also had a wander around the lovely gardens. There is also a small food court and a shop.Well worth a visit."
32,4.0,"My husband and I visited this museum on a cool raw day and enjoyed the free tour in English of the collections highlights (we were the only ones at 10am.) Our tour guide was hard to understand but was a Korean history major, so he knew a great deal about the pieces he was showing us and Korean history in general.  The stone pagoda, golden tiaras/belts and the pottery at the end are beautiful. The Museum gift shop was one of the best we found in Seoul, very reasonable prices, esp. the postcard set of 25 for $10. The reflective glass makes it hard to take good photos of some items. Compared to other Seoul attractions, the museum is quiet and spacious (built less than 25 years ago.)"
33,5.0,"We visited on a chilly, foggy, autumn morning which was the perfect kind of day for a museum visit. The museum is huge but is surrounded by gardens which are worth exploring. On entering you are immediately taken by the ceiling's design and the architectural simplicity of the exhibition halls off from the main rectangular atrium which has exhibits along its length. We spent a lovely couple of hours observing the many exhibits, my favourite being the rooms containing a variety of buddhas from across Asia. Definitely worth a visit, especially on a grey day, especially as its free.If you are heading elsewhere afterwards by bus, have a look for the shelter of memories, which is a bus stop on the main road outside with tile memories (in Korean) embedded among the bricks - quirky - I just wish I knew what they said!"
34,5.0,"Note: when you arrive there, you will see 2 entrance (one is on the left, the other is on the right). Make sure you go to the correct entrance (the right side). The National Museum of Korea is free of charge. The other entrance needs to pay. The museum showcases Korean culture from Paleolithic era until recent times. Each era or each kingdom artifacts are located at different area. Be prepare to spend half a day here as the collection is huge. If you are hungry in between gawking at the wonderful collections, there are a restaurant and a convenient shop in compound."
35,5.0,I went to the Museum not knowing very much about the history of Korea. This is a great place to start with all historical pieces accompanied with English notes. I spent the whole day hetr and enjoyed the scene and architectural structures all around.
36,5.0,Great displays and beautiful architecture.  The water feature outside shows the magnificent setting to its best.
37,5.0,"The property is huge in the middle of Seoul, with its garden extends over the area. Interesting architecture of the museum, wonderful dining experiences at the Korean restaurant, and you can stroll in its amazing garden for a while."
38,5.0,Huge space.  Impressive presentation.  Extensive displays of pottery and related artifacts.  The permanent displays are free.  Special displays have minimal admission fees.
39,5.0,"This is a very large museum. The number of artifacts they have collected is astounding. You learn so much about Korea’s fascinating history. I’d recommend a couple of hours to visit this museum. They have many English written descriptions for the displays and exhibits. If you’re interested in learning more about Korean traditions and history, then this is a must see museum."
40,5.0,"Well organized and very instructive, it helps the visitors to orient themselves in Korean culture and history."
41,3.0,"The design of the museum is lovely. However, the exhibits can be much improved. We were unfortunate to have visited the museum to coincide with a school visit. With kids out of control, the museum became a market place of voices and vandalism. My heart goes to the museum staff trying to handle these kids which by right should be under the teachers supervision."
42,5.0,Wow! Great experience and lots of things to see.Clean.Well-organized. Amazing artwork.Joyful and beautiful landscape.Lots of space.Explored and learned.Thank you for all the people who make it great place of learning and rest.
43,5.0,Really enjoyed our visit. The building is spectacular and the landscape / grounds fantastic.Exhibitions are good. Disappointingly not so much around Korean War and modern history. Perhaps that’s in another museum. There’s a gorgeous area in the grounds worth walking around and finding - Dragon Pond. Absolutely beautiful oasis.
44,4.0,"There's a lot to take in in this museum and I will admit my favorite part was finding cool art prints in the gift shop.  There's a lot of pottery, but many other things too.  I especially enjoyed the large Buddha statues."
45,5.0,"The building alone, along with it's vast gardens is worth a look but once inside, you could spend a whole day. Wonderfully displays depicting the history with plenty to keep the kids interested too."
46,5.0,"This was a last minute plan. We took the metro and the museum is right there. Free entrance and free guide. Our English speaking guide was a gentleman in his 80’s with a great passion for his country and history. The highlight of my trip was the statue of Sidhartra as a young Buddha in the moment of enlightenment. This bronze statue was casted 1400 years ago, the special smile of the character is unique. Our guide told us: “ if there is a Korean souvenir that you want to take back home, is that smile on your face”. And with that his tour concluded. There are other treasures worth visiting."
47,5.0,"If you like history and museums. A must visit. A very large museum and very very clean. Free entry. Only special exhibits are paid. Their 'tea shop' on 2nd floor (at the rear) has excellent and delicious local tea. Reaching the Museum is very easy. You can take Line 4 (Jungang Line) to Ichon station. Just follow the signs and there is an underground walk way (air conditioned) which takes you directly to the entry steps of The Museum. The grounds outside are also very beautiful. If it is NOT a warm day, you can spend time siting in the grounds as well. If you have the time, you can spend the full day here. It is better to see the Museum on your own rather than the free guided tours (one hour). Routes and directions in the Museum are clearly marked and the exhibits have a very elaborate writings and information."
48,5.0,"This is a new museum, with a great collection of korean art. THe building itself is impressive, and the lightniung is great. A nice pagode gives way to the museum secrets."
49,4.0,It's big museum with an extensive collection of archeological finds and art. Furthermore it's free. There is only limited information on the more recent developments in Korea for which the History Museum of Seoul is a better choice.
50,4.0,This is a nicely organized museum. Exhibition is arranged according to chronilogical order. Going through the exhibit halls and rooms taught me a lot about the history of Korea. I may be wrong but the artifacts often looked like recent replicas.
51,5.0,Built in this location in 2005.   It’s huge.    So easy to get to from the #4 Metro.    Signs in the Metro pointing to the Museum.   We took the free docent tour.   Took about 1:20.   Lots of information on the tour.   There is a huge breath to the museum.   We particularly liked the celadon pottery on the 3rd floor as well as the smaller Buddha statues.    Several restaurants and a food court.
52,5.0,"I saw very cool pictures of this futuristic place so definitely wanted to go and check it out. The building looks really cool and there was a market right outside it and also down below, very cool vibe and lots of fancy art installations around the museum. We didn't go inside as we are not so interested in museums, but it is definitely worth while just strolling around the place. Totally recommend it!"
53,5.0,"On returning to Seoul from a few days in the country we headed here for 2-3 hours before returning the hire car. The place is vast so we didn't do it full justice, but it is stuffed worth Korean treasures from across the agesProfessionally presented, well laid out,  there is a follow through route marked on the floor. And it is freeThis is a world class museum"
54,3.0,"Mostly artifacts. A nice, big space but not too interesting. Would have liked to see more art. Don't expect to spend much time here unless you have a keen interest in Korean artifacts."
55,5.0,"Wow!  How can we capture our full response to this beautifully designed museum?  Offering a vibrant span of Korean history, plus mesmerizing art and artifacts, we easily could have spent another couple of hours reading the well-written signs and descriptions about the diversity of Korea and beyond.  Pretty amazing to see art displayed through antiquity and modernity, with technology offering enlightening new ways to enjoy their stories and masterpieces.The collections were exquisite and the cultural Renaissance happening in Korea is inspiring.  How amazing to get to be a witness to the transformation.  The visit to the National Museum of Korea informed the rest of our trip around the peninsula."
56,4.0,"We visited during a national holiday so there was not charge. This is a really great museum to visit if you are interested in war history.  It has a floor dedicated to all the historical wars that Korea has been a part of, and then a floor for the Korean - American war.  This is fascinating, and certainly carries the Korean perspective on the war.  Wish we had more time there."
57,5.0,I enjoyed this museum.The building is huge and modern in a nice surrounding area.There are two main exhibition halls. One with a permanent exhibition about the history of Korea through different artefacts and another one with temporary exhibitions. The main gallery is free admission. If you enjoy history and looking at different artefacts you can spend a few hours there. I went on my own on a Sunday morning and I spent around three hours. There are spaces for you to sit down and rest your legs. There are also some cafeterias and museum shoppings. Throughout the building.I sincerely recommend.
58,5.0,"That was our last day in South Korea, and our last day of the long vacation. So, we were a bit exhausted, and the museum  building is so big. It’s amazing, the architecture, and the collection."
59,5.0,The building is imposing and the exhibits very well laid out.It is not cluttered and there are themed rooms with very good exhibits.Well worth a visit while you are in Seoul.
60,5.0,Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building. Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts. Plan at least a half a day to fully appreciate
61,5.0,This beautiful museum is definitely worth your time. The long history of Korean civilization is beautiful presented and the exhibits have English explanations so no need for a tour. The main museum is free and there is a charge for special exhibits. It’s set in beautiful grounds and near a subway stop.
62,5.0,"Free admission at a first class museum. All the donated collections on the second floor made the visit extra special. The donated collections often contain hundreds of items from a particular collectors area of interest. We were amazed at the generosity of the Korean donors and interested by the unique items that Japanese collectors had actually returned to Korea. Sometimes in museums, when items are arranged by time period and isolated, smaller items seem to lose their beauty. We were impressed that Korean collectors saved so many items from their respective areas of collecting, even though the nation has endured such hardships since its independence. Love the building and grounds. Didn't have time to get to the special exhibitions but this place is worthy of a second day visit.  We were happy to see art in Korean everyday items like furniture, money, and even sewing items."
63,4.0,"The museum building is world class, and was the most interesting part about our visit.  The museum is very well organized, with a helpful layout that makes it easy to walk from room to room.  Lots of different types of Buddhas and history of the country (Japan rule, Buddhism, ancient tools, pottery, weaponry, etc.)  As a foreigner in South Korea, I could not fully appreciate the expansive rooms of rock weapons, excavated pottery and the ceramic vase exhibition.  There are fire extinguishers everywhere; from one spot I could physically see eleven fire extinguishers.  At the restaurant we had a western-style salad and an octopus rice dish; both were very good and reasonably priced."
64,5.0,"This is a big museum with several floors and a large exhibition of artifacts from the different Korean history and dynasties, such as statues, paintings, ceramics, calligraphy, etc.The museum is free and family-friendly, as there were many families and tours with kids when we visited on a Saturday, still it didn't feel crowded."
65,5.0,"Very interesting place if you want to learn more about Korean culture, historu and art. Everything is divided into different time decades so you can easier understand the historical periods and heritage. Very calm and meditative place 😊"
66,5.0,"This is a wonderful museum, allow 2 days to visit. Beautifully displayed exhibits, and a great coffee place with superb cappuccinos."
67,5.0,"This museum is free to enter and is first class..... the way in which the exhibits are displayed, clearly described (in English) was excellent. There is very low lighting throughout which may be an issue for anyone with poor vision....The museum itself is a very modern contemporary building that oozes quality.In summary this is a jewel in the crown of museums and one you certainly would not want to miss, first class. Allow at least one hour and possibly more if you want to take it all in......"
68,4.0,A must place for those history-lovers. You can understand the history of each dynasty until Korea today. Audio tour is just 1000w and there’s a free guided tour at specific time. Highly recommended for the guided tour which takes 1.5 hours.
69,5.0,"Worth a visit if you are into history, they have everything from Neolithic to modern Korea as well as a South East Asia exhibit.It is close to the metro and only a couple of stops from the war memorial as well."
70,5.0,We spent about 3 hours here. The grounds were beautiful and the art was plentiful. It was great to see history from another country through art. Very well laid out.
71,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is one grand building in the Yongsan area.  It can be easily accessed by metro to the Yongsan Station.  The museum opens everyday except January 1.  No admission fee for the main exhibit hall but not for the special exhibition galleries.  The building itself is huge and there are 3 levels.  We visited the main exhibition hall only.  We rented an audio device which gives verbal description of the artifact when to input the number on the show case.  It is very helpful as the rooms are always too dark and the description on the plague are too small to read.    The 1-hour free guided tour is very helpful too.  The lady tour guide spoke perfect English.  She showed us the highlights of the museum: the pagoda, huge Buddha painting scroll and some of the royal jewelry.  I highly recommend this.There are gift shops on every floor and they sell slightly different things from each other. We had our lunch at the Mirror Pond Restaurant which is outside the main museum.  We chose a set lunch of traditional Korean dishes which includes 10 different Korea food: snacks, kimchi, porridge, appetizers, main courses, desserts and tea.  It is different and quite enjoyable.If your schedule is not that tight, you can spend a few hours in this museum to find out more about the history of Korea."
72,5.0,"A visit to this museum is worth it just to take in the setting and the unique architecture of the building.  While the art collection is probably not as stunning as many would like, and it is mostly related to Korean history, the museum is easy to navigate and impressive in its design.  We had lunch in the restaurant overlooking the grounds.  The food was Korean fare, good, but not great; nonetheless, we enjoyed sitting beside the floor to ceiling windows and taking in the view."
73,4.0,"You'll need a couple of days to fully explore all of the items housed here, especially if you're into reading all of the information like I am. This is my favorite museum in Korea."
74,5.0,"We went to the free tour that is held in English and in my opinion, this is the only way to visit the museum which would have otherwise been very overwhelming because it is so big. The tour guide was GREAT and broke down the most important items in the museum. He gave us tons of information- it was SO interesting! I also love that the museum is free."
75,5.0,"A large museum with many interesting displays, and you can spend an hour or a day here. Some displays have been fixed-up and really gave a taste of the old Korean culture. Besides the size of the building itself, it was a bit of a walk from the Ichon metro station as well, so wear your most comfortable shoes for this one."
76,5.0,"What a superb museum! We were very impressed by the sheer size of it, the magnificent architectural design of the building, the incredible gardens, but about every all, the exhibits. It was an amazing experience for us and a fantastic opportunity to see all the exhibits, the art collections, the artifacts representative of past eras in Korea. We are very impressed with the job the curator did with all the exhibits. At no time did we ever encounter large crowds or other distraction. We were able to fully enjoy our visit and the ease with which we could study each exhibit quietly and uninterruptedly. The collections are superb, the excellent preservation condition they are in and the helpful information available to the public to help us learn about Korea's past.I strongly recommend a visit to this museum. It's absolutely magnificent! We also had lunch there after we were done and were equally impressed with the restaurant. Excellent food!"
77,4.0,"Very good museum that contains a wealth of artifacts and information on the history of Korea from the Neolithic period through the various kingdoms and Dynasties. Also exhibits on Korean calligraphy, paintings, and some exhibits from other areas of Asia. Did I mention the admission is free?  Easy access on Subway Line 4. at Ichon Station"
78,5.0,"Had an enjoyable afternoon. Lots to see over many subjects. Great history explained well. Hours vary, so check first."
79,5.0,The museum is what you would expect but the underrated part is their lovely park that surrounds the museum. There is even a small man-made  waterfall and lake.Took my wife on our first date here and she loved it.
80,4.0,"The place is spotless clean . It would open your eyes on what korea was before. Must see, it is free of charge"
81,5.0,"Admission free. Also English tour free.The tour was very informative and covered all the highlights. The guide helped us choose other areas to see on our own. The museum itself was world class, beautiful and air conditioned."
82,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is one of the best museums I have ever visited. They have a great collection of Buddha statutes, and they are huge and fascinating. The museum has different exhibition halls which exhibits according to different dynasties. Definitely a must-go if you love culture and are visiting Korea!"
83,5.0,"If you visit one thing in Seoul, make it the Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you visit a second thing, make it this museum. The National Museum of Korea is huge, but very well laid out. A typical route takes you on a trip through Korean history from neolithic to 20th Century. Then there are additional galleries for different areas (China, Japan, etc.) and types of objects (porcelain, bronzes, etc.).The museum is free, but they often have excellent special exhbits for which there is a charge (typically KRW 5,000-6,000). The museum is set in a beautifully landscaped park, which makes a nice walk if you arrive 45 minutes or so before the opening time. The museum is easily reached from a dedicated passageway from the Ichon station on Line #4; but the passage opens at 8:00, so don't count on it before that! Otherwise, it is a short walk above-ground."
84,5.0,Best way to view the history and traditional culture of Korea.   The museum is huge and the architecture is magnificent.  Admission is free.  Subway station is Ichon on the number 4 line.
85,5.0,Fabulous building situated in beautiful gardens which overlook a lake. Well worth a visit. The art is spread over 3 floors surrounding huge internal foyer. This means it's not too overwhelming and you can see a lot in a short space of time. It's also free!
86,5.0,"I did not expect to enjoy a museum so much. There is an immense amount to see, as well as rooms that teach you about their scientific preservation process which was extremely interesting and which I found to be different to the typical museum because it elevates and informs the audience's perception (or lack thereof) of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes that is invisible to the typical museum goer's eye. What I thought would be a quick stroll through became a three hour trip which was in itself still rushed so I could have gladly spent half or an entire day there. Best of all, entrance was free, which is amazing considering this is an extremely well designed and organised museum. At the lower section there is also a lovely souvenir shop to go through."
87,3.0,"If I do not know a City I start from the Museum. I had only one morning free and it was really beautiful to be in this building and appreciate the Architecture outside and inside.Not having knoledge of this culture I joined a tour and was a good experience, not too long, topic pieces. Is true which the number of pieces it is not huge, but it is a way to indulge and digest better what is in display. Comeing from Italy I know to be spoild, in our museum we host tons of incredible pieces of Art. Here in Asia I found a different concept of border between Art and Handicraft. Anyway in my mind now I have some more puzzle pieces, to picture differeces in Asian cultures.In this Museum the big lack, in my point of view is in the display concept, too traditional. I aspected more interactive ideas or tecnological way to show working process. An use of technology to display Budda in his original location or give information. The Museum was full of student playing wit them mobile phone. The same device could be interact with pieces in display, telling the stories of each piece and make interaction between students."
88,5.0,This museum was very nice. Lots of beautiful artwork. Takes a while to go though and see all exhibits. My husband and I enjoyed the free museum. We did not go to the special exhibits so I cannot comment on those. But there is plenty of interesting art and cultural pieces to see in the free museum and it will take you a good part of the day. Plenty of bathrooms and plenty of places to get some quick food or drink. There is a very pretty park outside.
89,5.0,The architecture was stunning...and I am from NYC so I know from museums.Staff helpful.So much Korean history that you really need two days to do it justice.Enjoyed sitting in the surrounding park.
90,4.0,"It's hard to believe that you're still living history when you walk through this place. It's set up to look like history but it's current events. Some of the displays saddened me, some just seemed like much propaganda."
91,5.0,You can see from the second you walk into the huge atrium that this is going to be a world class museum. The information is presented tastefully and clearly and there is a great deal to see. Completely free too! Seoul is a lovely city!
92,5.0,"The museum is located in the middle of a beautiful park. If it was just for the architecture the visit would already be worth wile. Is a huge three floors building in which is located a very tall and ancient pagoda. They offer very good english spoken tours. If you can, you should take it. That museum show how proud Koreans must be of their country."
93,3.0,A nice museum where you can see and learn about the history and culture in the earlier days. Do check out the special exhibition that they have if you are lucky enough to visit. Managed to see the mummy exhibition while visiting and it was definitely interesting to see up close.
94,5.0,"If you have an interest in Korean history and culture as expressed through pottery, and metalwork you will find this museum to be quite satisfying. The many statues of Buddhas from Korea and other countries are awe inspiring and quite beautiful."
95,5.0,I love going to museums. i learned alot of korean culture while I was here in the National Museum of Korea :) I suggest you go here weekdays as there are few people during weekdays; expect many tourist and locals during weekends :)
96,4.0,Really great venue and easy to access. There is an app to help you around the museum which you should download before you visit but free wifi at the venue helps. Would return.
97,5.0,"It was wonderful that it was directly off the metro stop so it made it easy to find and get to. The building itself is lovely, and the admission is free. I learned a lot about Korean history in this very cool peaceful setting."
98,5.0,"The national museum of Korea it's a must if you came to Korea. In just a couple hours the museum shows the history of the country, and also it's a really nice view. The museum has everything translated (wich is nice if you don't speak korean) easy access and a nice area."
99,5.0,Plan on spending at least 2-3 hours in this extremely clean and modern museum. Lots to see.  Loved th 10 story pagoda.
100,5.0,Best English translations we have seen in Korea for a museum. Better than Hong Kong's translations. First floor is all Korean history we skipped the upper floors which appear to be artifacts and paintings. Lunch at their restaurant was the best museum food we have ever had. Highly recommended.
101,4.0,The design of the museum into a pagoda is very unique and empathetic of the surrounding heritage palace. The museum itself is full of knowledge worthy of discovery. I would recommend spending at least 2-3 hours here to explore the place.
102,4.0,"There is a museum and also real old street with old style korean shops, its with same place another palace. Check to close days before go"
103,5.0,"NMOK use to be on a standstill a couple years back, there wasn't much action going on and exhibitions were quite bland. It has become much more lively recently and I am impressed by how much the exhibits have become lively and improved in content. Now I feel like it is appropriate to say that art enthusiasts should definitely consider stopping by this great establishment."
104,3.0,"Good for overview of Korean history, but difficult to follow as the story was not well told (i.e. did not flow well) and there were limited English descriptions."
105,5.0,You will need a whole day to look at everything on the 3 floors of this museum. We went for a couple of hours in the morning and there were lots of korean students visiting. The building is very impressive inside and out. The museum has an excellent collection that portrays many years of korean history. Good for both koreans and foreigners. There's a cafe inside the museum where you could rest your legs. We took a taxi into the parking lot where there is a drop off point but on our way out we had to walk a little bit to get to the streets to grab a taxi. Well worth the visit.
106,5.0,"Along with the Korean War Memorial, it was a really nice way to spend the day just by walking around!"
107,5.0,"What an amazing place. It covers much of Korean history through art and artifacts including painting, furniture, needlework, pottery, and other things. It is well laid out in an expansive building that is wonderful. There is a spacious main hall with the exhibits off of this. The atrium entrance is stunning in it's design and we were wowed. We asked information about the architect and she told us that many visitors ask that question. We enjoyed the museum learning much about Korea and enjoying a Korean architects design."
108,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea is easily accessible using the subway. Get to the Ichon station, which is on the 4th line, and there should be signs showing directions to the museum. The museum is about Korean history that starts off from the very beginning to the end of Joseon dynasty. Would recommend to museum loving enthusiasts or anyone that wants a piece of Korean history!"
109,4.0,The place has a lot of history an tremendous teaching areas. It provides ample learning of tools for all those who visit it.
110,5.0,"If you have time, be sure to go here. Easy by subway. There is a little store next to it where you can buy snacks. Entry is free. This is a huge modern building with some magnificent works in it. Does a very good job of telling Korean history from the very beginning. Will take an entire day if you let it. You can take photos inside."
111,5.0,"We spent 21/2 hours at the museum with our day tour guide who gave us a wonderful overview of some of the major exhibits. To do it justice would take 2-3 days. On entering the incredible building one is immediately attracted to the 10 story Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda at the end of the main hallway. Constructed in 1340 from marble rather than granite the pagoda is a Korean national treasure. It was stolen and shipped to Japan in 1907 but was returned in the 1960's after international pressure on the Japanese government.Also a must see are the various Buddhas and other historical artifacts that have amazing detail and workmanship.The museum was busy with many young students observing and making notes but at no time did it feel crowded because of its spaciousness.We also noted that the students were taking their excursion very seriously and well mannered. On leaving the Museum, we were pleasantly surprised that we were engaged (in English) by a small group of teenage students who wanted to try their language skills. The students were extremely polite and we had a pleasant  conversation until we parted ways in the coach parking lot. We enjoyed the contact and the students seemed to as well."
112,2.0,"This is a very large, impressive building(and grounds) that I believe was built in 2005.  Unfortunately, while the building is large & impressive, the way artifacts are displayed seem like that of a much older,dated museum (bottom line- not very creative or interesting).  It was difficult locating the museum, as it seemed like no residents have been, or even have heard of this museum.?!?  Entry is free (must be funded by the government), yet there were just over a handful of visitors there(practically empty)- and this was on a rainy(perfect for going to a museum) day. If this museum was self-supporting, I imagine it would be hemorrhaging tens of thousands of dollars/day due to its' extremely low attendance.  We had lunch at one of the (nearly empty)restaurants.  While I love most Korean food, what we had was pretty bad.What a shame- a lot of money went into constructing this museum!"
113,5.0,"The museum is large, but easily accessible. Wheelchair users will find that many portions of the facility to easy to reach. You will see a wide range of history and art. You will learn about the nation's history, its rulers, wars, culture, art, and the people. Regardless of your interests, you will find something that grabs your attention.We went during a weekday and there were many school groups present. Even young children seemed to enjoy the place. There are several places to eat and to shop. The restrooms are clean.Amazingly, admission was free."
114,4.0,We liked this museum. Had lots to see. Left us pondering. Great display of artefacts. Facilities were clean with drinking stations everywhere which was very useful. Lots of seating too. Nice views of Seoul N tower too.
115,5.0,"Really recommended to go to this museum. you can easily catch a train to go directly to the museum (green line). We spend 2-3 hour here, wandering through the garden and the hall. On occasions, there are outdoor theater as well (likes esplanade in Singapore)"
116,3.0,"Reachable by train. but u need to walk 500 m after. dont worry,  It has connection with the subway station.  i stayed in lotte hotel seoul, and takes around 45 minutes to b there. its a big museum. too much space i think.  :) collection r great yet its all abt korea.  good for history subject student.  and for those who curious abt the ancient of korea.  if you are adventurous person, dont put this on your list. good escape from the crowd of city. very nice view outside the building."
117,5.0,Very interesting building in its own right. The collections are very well organized especially if one is not too familiar with the very long history of Korea. The building is large and spacious so it takes some time to go  through it even if one does not read everything. We signed up for the tour with one of the English speaking docents/guides.  She was very informative and pointed to the exceptional pieces whether for their historical or artistic significance.
118,2.0,"Not worth it unless you're bored and it's raining. I heard this is one of the biggest museums in Asia. Unfortunately I was underwhelmed. Huge space with little content. Also there was a HUGE exhibit for Dok island, which was a waste. The only thing they showed were pictures of rocks."
119,5.0,"Probably one of the most impressive museums I've ever been to - just goes to show what museums can look like if they have enough funding! The exhibits themselves are fabulous - well researched, in-depth and such a huge variety of objects and approaches to their display. I especially enjoyed their approach to showing archaeological processes and finds. The architecture itself is impressive in itself - just enormous and so well-made. My only criticism would be that I thought the layout itself was a bit banal, arranging the exhibits in chronological order.Other than that, I could have spent hours in there just wandering around, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an insight into Korean history. The shop also sells some beautiful objects (albeit expensive), and is well worth a look."
120,5.0,"This is a beautiful building.  Although we did not know when we arrived, but the subway stop for this museum has an exit on the museum grounds.  It has a fabulous collection, both of prehistory artifacts and items throughout the ages.  I especially  like the porcelain collection."
121,4.0,Large and extensive collection of artifacts and details about Korea's long history. Good for people who have an interest and/or want to learn more about Korea. Commit a few hours as it is quite large.
122,5.0,Dont miss this opportunity to visit the national Museum in Seoul. Really it is well organised and the way they present the history is wonderful
123,5.0,"This was a really great experience. I learned a lot about Korean history and culture from walking through this museum. If you are only in Seoul a short time, or if you do not have a historical perspective already, this is a must-experience attraction."
124,4.0,"Reached easily via an underground travellator from the nearby Metro station, the National Museum is certainly worth a visit. The permanent exhibits range over three beautiful floors, the ground level being particularly pleasing aesthetically and architecturally.The Museum is free to everyone. It includes an terrific lounge/relaxation area and delightful grounds to stroll and spectacular views on one side."
125,4.0,"August is a v hot month and to escape the heat, we visited the museum. At 2pm we went on a guided tour that lasted 1.5 hrs. It was great (esp since there were only 2 of us!). Guide was an elderly Korean gentleman who piqued our interest about Korean history so much so that we bought 'A Brief History of Korea' at the museum shop!"
126,5.0,"close by the castle the museum was one of the highlights of our tour you can buy a ticket for both given you a discount, loved the way that the museum was laid out which made it very easy to view all the contents which covered over five floors"
127,5.0,"Situated on an enormous plot of land in this immense city, the dedication of this city to art is admirable.  The building is outstanding, with an immense atrium surrounded by large display spaces, the objects very attractively arranged.  Not everything is in English, but you can get the audio guide.  And, dont expect European art here: this is Asean, mostly Buddhist. Outside, the park is an oasis of calm, with ponds and pavilions."
128,3.0,"This is a large museum with facts and information about Korea. We found ourselves going here while it was raining, and it made for a good rainy day activity. The museum had a lot of great history about Korea and included many interesting things."
129,5.0,This was great to learn the history of south korea and they had lots of interactive things inthe museum along with examples of attire and living quarters etc over the years.
130,5.0,"Worth seeing for the facility alone, frankly.  Very spacious and many interesting displays.  We only had about 2 hours, not really enough, but still got a lot out of the visit.  Definitely a top attraction from the places we visited in Seoul especially as we had rain part of the day."
131,5.0,I recommend the English speaking tours which are conducetd by volunteers. Check with website for the scheduled tours.
132,5.0,"This building and the grounds are fantastic.  Probably the best thing that we saw in Seoul.  The artwork and historical treasures are amazing.  Most of the descriptions of the works are in English.  Allow yourself at least a day to ""do"" this place maybe more if you are into antiquities.  There is food available and caters to Western tastes,  As in all of Korea, the toilets are spotless."
133,5.0,Be prepared to walk as its huge with 3 floors of exhibits. Do check if the special exhibits are open as they close on some days. It's free and very well maintained. We were tired so only managed to see 1-1/2 floors on our own. Would probably be better if we paid for a guide. Entrance is FOC.
134,4.0,"Nothing new and grande here if you have been to other ""ceramic"" museums in Asia, with that being said, they often have guest exhibits that can really turn a rainy day into a wonderful day. Keep your eye peeled for what's on guest display."
135,5.0,"We spent 1/2 day here exploring this museum and its lovely grounds.Considering the free admission price, this is definitely the best attraction for the money in all of Seoul.Don't miss the nearby ""Hangul Museum"" which has many Korean language exhibits (also free)."
136,4.0,"Every time I travel I make sure to look for museums. This trip is definitely no exception. To say that one appreciates the Korean culture is an understatement because the culture is complex as their history. To fully appreciate them, one must be open-minded, free from stereotypes, and with a deep sense of craving to understand what makes them who they are today. The best place to get this wealth of information is their National Museum. This place is kids friendly :)"
137,5.0,This modern building houses the collection from the very beginnings to the last king. All items are presented professionally and you can get an audio tour that highlights some main exhibits. Nice cafeteria at the top level.
138,5.0,"Worth a visit to this lovely (free) museum. Easy to get to on the metro - three floors charting the history and artefacts of Korea - so in a very real sense it's a national museum. It concentrates solely on Korea - but I loved it, it was spacious - we went on a Saturday and it seems that is a school day as it was full of children - who surprisingly were not that well behaved - the space seemed to encourage them to run riot which was a bit surprising.The exhibits are a combination of historical artefacts, modern media and IT and it's very well balanced - I'd like the chance to go again. It's set in a large park which was also nice to explore and it's close to the metro - like everything else in Seoul - it's well connected"
139,5.0,"I made the mistake of coming here on a Tuesday at first, which was a fail because I didn't realize that Monday was a holiday and they close on Mondays, but if Mondays are a holiday they close on the subsequent day. So the place was closed and we spent the time exploring the grounds instead, which was quite a lovely alternative as there were numerous gardens, a pond, and a couple of pagodas. So of course we came back the next day and proceeded to tour the museum. This place is HUGE, with 6+ floors of galleries filled to brim with historical information. I learned so much about calligraphy, marriage ceremonies, the different eras of Korea, etc. After a few hours and being only on the 3rd floor, we were starting to become tired and bored, so we decided to rest in this huge nice sunny room with couches everywhere before leaving.  The museum is easily accessible from the subway (there's a stop right outside the grounds) and one of the exits takes you right up to the museum. Admission is free as well so definitely feel free to come on multiple days as it's hard to finish it in one, especially if you LOVE history or if it's rainy haha. For me, I'm not much of a history nut, so a few hours here was definitely sufficient for me."
140,5.0,"The National Museum of Korea occupied vast piece of land and was very well constructed with impressive open-court before entering the museum.  It's 4 levels with an atrium in the center gave an attractive welcoming perspective of the museum and also simplified the setup of the different halls.  The treasures were well displayed and divided into different categories and with the assistance of the escalators, moving around the museum was relatively easy.  There were clean toilets facilities in every floor.  The lobby of the museum has a giant video board to announce any message the management would like to post.  On our arrival from the cruise ship, the board displayed the welcome of our group."
141,4.0,"This is a rather nice and super spacious museum near the center of Seoul. It is accessible by many buses and the Metro. I stress its size again because any shops and museums in Asia are so tiny and the walking area is so limited, that the space and freedom to walk around and enjoy the artifacts is so refreshing. Most exhibits have are in English in addition to the standard Korean. If there is a group of more than ten in English, there will be a guide to walk you around. If you are in Korea and looking for something to do, head down to the National Museum of Korea and it’s free!"
142,5.0,"Great day trip, the main area is free and well maintained.  The last two exhibitions I saw there (Pompey and Buddha Styles) were excellent with a minimal entrance fee.I always recommend my students to visit the museum and the ones who do really have good time and learn a lot about Korea."
143,4.0,"The Korean National Museum should be one of your first stops in Seoul if you don't know much about Korea. Before you can understand where Korea's is going you need to understand where it  came from. The museum is divide into two halves: A Korean history/culture side and side for imported exhibitions. Currently,  Jan 2016, the Prince of Lichtenstein has loaned a number of Rueben's and his era artist. I believe this exhibitions runs through end of Feb 2016. You have to pay to see that exhibition.    The other side is the Korean history & culture Museum. This fits my entertainment budget - free.  I found the  museum to be very user friendly with English description at most pieces.  They also have a audio available for those following a specific walking tour. I don't know how many languages are available though.  I saw a number of children, Korean & non-Korean, with a what I believe is ""Where is Waldo"" book in an attempt to keep them interested and participate in the museum experience.  The museum is organized by time span and the various kingdoms which governed this peninsula.  There is a eatery and coffee shop in the musuem. The building architecture is very open and spacious. The ground around the build are well landscaped and offers plenty of place to sit to and enjoy your lunch.     Korean archaeology is still in its infancy. Remember they spent nearly half of the twentieth century under Japanese occupation, a bloody civil war, a number of dictators and finally a fledgling  democracy starting in the 80's. Archaeology was not a primary focus. Additionally, one of the three kingdom of Korea Goryeo is located in North Korea and NW China. So there is a lot of history still to unearth. I give it a 4.5 out of 5. Easy to get to, free, and very interesting."
144,3.0,"The building is beautiful, as is the outdoor area.  However, I am not a true museum fan and not really my cup of tea.  This is no Louve or MOMA....and unless there is something you really want to see at the exhibit and assuming your time is limited while visiting Seoul, I would pass.  Of course, this is coming from a normally non-museum lover so please take this with a grain of salt."
145,5.0,"There a numerous museums in Seoul and this is a must see,great history and wonderful artifacts although not all of the information is in English.Free admission to main museum and there was a special exhibition while we were there on the history of Buddha which we paid a fee to enter and was worth it.Subway to Ichon Station Line 4 Exit 2 and museum is connected via a underpass."
146,4.0,Easy to navigate and pretty interesting. We did a quick run through as we did not get the audio guides and there is limited information in English. There is much more info in Korean. Give yourself an hour and a half for a quick visit and of course longer if need.
147,5.0,The building and setting are wonderful and the art inside has masterpiece after masterpiece beautifully displayed with full English language labeling.
148,5.0,"The museum entrance was free at the time of our visit which was an unexpected  bonus. As the title suggests, it is a very large museum - allocate at least half a day to explore it in its entirety. You can see pretty much all of korean history there, chronologically organized on the bottom floor, topically on the second. Me and my husband had a great time, but we had only two hours which made for a hasty end to the visit. There is also a childrens room and exhibition inside the museum so you can also bring your kids there without fear of boredom."
149,4.0,"The National Museum of Korea is one of several large scale free attractions in Seoul that is worth spending a few hours, particularly if you are keen to learn about Korea's rich history.  Opening Hours are 9am to 6pm (T,TH,F), 9am to 9pm (W,ST), 9am - 7pm (SN, holidays), closed on Mondays. The museum is divided into three floors, each requiring an hour or two to view properly, meaning you should plan on 3/4 of a day or more if you want to fully explore the entire museum. There are brochure maps in the lobby and the museum website does well to describe what you see in the various galleries. This is definitely worth some time prior to your visit if you want to plan out your visit. For those with limited time, you will probably want to focus on just one of the floors. If this is the case, we'd suggest the ground floor, which covers the history of Korea, stretching from the Paleolithic to more recent times. Here you will find many interesting displays and some particularly impressive artefacts, some of which are registered as national treasures in Korea. We particularly like the celadon collection, the silla gold items and the late 14th century Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda. Note that the galleries are modern and Items well-displayed throughout the museum, accompanied by sufficient but not overburdening text (Korean and English). A few video programmes are mixed in to help make the museum more accessible to younger visitors. To this end, there is an entire Children's Museum, near the Food Court, dedicated to presenting history in a hands-on way for younger visitors. Families visiting the museum will likely want to check this out. There are expected lockers, gift shop and several eateries including a decent food court on the ground floor with affordable meals as well a M Cafe on the second floor where you can take a break for coffee and ice-cream. Wifi service is available throughout the museum as well. Overall, we find the National Museum of Korea to be a very good free museum for residents and visitors to Seoul. It is a nice place to learn about the history of Korea as well as other areas of Asia if you have interest and time to do so. We will happily return for additional visits during future trips to Seoul."
150,5.0,2nd time I visit the museum. And of course there is always something new to see.It's covering all the history of Korea from prehistorical to new ages.Best museum for long time.
151,5.0,The national museum is a magnificent edifice with a lot of history about South Korea. There is easy access to the museum and you only need a ticket if you want to visit specific rooms
152,5.0,"The museum is huge and has an impressive collection of exhibits on display.  As reference, I spent about 5 hours here for the guided tour, took lunch in the food court (located behind the gift shop) and lost myself in the calligraphy and Buddhists sections.This museum is awesome!"
153,5.0,"Not to be missed. A beautiful, wonderful museum. And so well done. Learned a tremendous amount about Korean history and was so impressed by the architecture of the building and the park setting around."
154,5.0,It was nice to have a look into korean history. It is easy to spend there hours. Depends (as always) from the degree of interest.
155,5.0,"We had a great visit to the museum. We went on the English language tour and were the only people on it, so we basically had a free private tour. Our guide was really helpful and was genuinely passionate about educating people about Korean history."
156,5.0,I always enjoy visiting museums and this one is no exception. There are many halls exhibiting artefacts from the ancient past of Korea however I found it to get a little repetitive after a little while. That being said I would absolutely recommend anyone to visit here if they visit Seoul
157,5.0,Free admission Easy to get to with metro Lovely outside spaces. Bring a picnic Beautiful calm space inside very well laid out and while not all in English there was more than enough for us to understand The 9th most visited museum in the world  Well worth bidit
158,5.0,An amazing home for a huge collection.  Of special interest is the Chinese treasure ship wreck recovery.  Ceramic collection is (predictably) especially strong and beautifully exhibited.  Next time we'll try the restaurant -- it looked great.
159,4.0,"This may be a free museum but it's not lacking in exhibits.  There is so much to see here that during our year long stay in Korea we visited almost half a dozen times.This museum has more than it's fair share of Korean National Treasures which are well worth the visit alone,.The grounds are nice for a gentle stroll around if you start to get overwhelmed by the exhibits.This museum also hosts special exhibits at different points of the year, some of these charge but the ones we went to were worth the charge."
160,5.0,"Like any museums it's very educationalLots of peoplecons.. some tourists should control their children better, a museum is not a play ground to run around and scream."
161,4.0,"Average Museum in comparison with the World Museums but still it is worth visiting.Korean, Japanese & Indian (also other Asian) art & historical item are displayed in 3 stories.  It is free admission and they have English tours but we were late for one so we explore it all by ourselves. It is nice & clean & air-conditioned inside, there are benches to get some rest. It is easy to find, from the metro station there are metals plates on the ground leading all way down to the Museum entrance."
162,5.0,"Compared to the one in Taiwan, I enjoyed this museum better. Perhaps because it is free and layout is very organized. they provide headset which has all informative information. It was enjoyable two hour walk."
163,3.0,"I'm a museum lover but this place bored and disappointed me. Don't get me wrong it is a very nice and huge museum but by the time I visited I had already been to these museums: Royal Palace, Folk and War Memorial. So I felt like I had already seen a lot of the things at this place. The reason I was disappointed was because a lot of things were marked as replicas (I find this a common occurrence at all the museums I've been to in Korea) and when I go to museums I want to see the real thing, not a replica.So even though I was bored I can't really say ""don't go here"" because after all it's free!"
164,3.0,This place is free and it is huge.  If you are into Korean history it is a great place to visit.  The downside is that like most museums in Korea they all have the same stuff generally.  If you've gone to one you've gone to them all.  So if you need to just visit one historical museum this one is a good bet.  The building and surrounding area is also worth a look.  You get a great view of Seoul Tower from here also.
165,4.0,"An excellent collection of Korean artifacts which are well laid out and displayed. A visit here will give you an appreciation of the depth of Korean history, and it is free. You can wander around the extensive grounds and gardens outside and then continue your journey through the modern galleries within. There is also a nice tea shop and good casual restaurant in the complex,"
166,4.0,"This is an exceptional facility, with a very wide array of exhibits. Korea is a very ancient land and this museum really helps you appreciate that. It is well laid out and multiple languages."
167,3.0,"The place was large and had quite a lot of things shown, however most of it felt like they sort of just placed it behind glass and gave it a description. No real storyline or interaction on the exhibits. Felt pretty average too me."
168,3.0,Very nice building and surroundings but the exhibition is very ordinary. Nothing really spectacular. If you have limited time you can skip it.
169,4.0,A very nice museum with an extensive collection of artifacts from Korean culture. A full day or more to see it all.
170,4.0,"The museum is spacious on impressive grounds.  There are interesting Korean/Asian artifacts from various areas (recovered from a shipwreck, large Buddha related sculptures, etc.).  Our audioguides did not work well, but did not seem to be particularly informative when they did work."
171,5.0,"A National Museum is a national showcase, and gives a country the chance to really show itself off.  The South Koreans have really embraced the opportunity here, with a massive, imposing structure surrounded by a lake and manicured gardens, with an air conditioned automatic walkway from the nearest subway station.The interior is no less impressive, as is the collection of artefacts.  You could spend a whole day in here, without question.  We took a guided tour, which was provided free and hosted by a volunteer.  ""John"", our guide, was an accomplished English-speaker who gave our small group of strangers a wonderfully educational and entertaining tour of what he considered to be the highlights of the museums' huge collection.  It was a great way to get a feel for the place, as well as getting some valuable cultural insights from a Seoul local.After the tour we wandered around a little ourselves, then had coffee in the bright, airy restaurant on the ground floor.The National Museum of Korea is worth a look; if you're pressed for time, do some research and arrive in time for a guided tour.  It's well worth the effort."
172,5.0,"A very imposing building, great architecture, well laid out and the most extensive museum about the Asian continent esp. Korea history. Labels for art and display are in Korean and English. Very easy to navigate and they way it was section was amazing. Very good restaurant in the museum and lots of parking. On our visit we were also entertained by the National Ballet of Korea....I highly recommend and certainly I will be back to visit S. Korea again in the next 5 years."
173,5.0,This is a 10yr. old modern building with a marble interior of spacious exhibition galleries.  We were lucky to hook up with an English speaking guide who was showing 3 visiting business men the displays.  The historical ride from a semi-tribal society to being overrun by warriors from the west to the eventual unification of the country under the Silla Dynasty with its capital in Gyeongju is all presented in style.  Celadon ceramics to beautifully crafted gold adornments are just part of a splendid inventory.
174,4.0,We really enjoyed the museum. The pottery was very interesting and we lost track of the time there. We saw exhibits on each floor but had to selective because of time.The building and grounds are beautiful as well.The metro stop is about 50m from the grounds.
175,4.0,"This is like any big city museum - has lots of ""stuff"" but if you sign up for a guided tour (we signed up for the English speaking tour) you will have a much better experience.  The museum store also had some nice souvenirs if you are unable to make it to Insadong."
176,4.0,"We spent good time in this museum, were very impressed with art collection,and surroundings,and got knowledge about Korean art,and rich culture."
177,4.0,"It is a really good place to understand the history of Korea from the stone age until 18th century.  The museum has English translation.  The park outside the Museum is also a good place taking picture.  And, you can see the N Seoul Tower from there."
178,4.0,"This is an oasis in Seoul, where you can calm down and learn the relatively short history of the country. After the visit, you will probably naturally understand the reason with Korea's homogeneity. History is truly a mirror of today."
179,5.0,"This museum was one of my favorite parts of my honeymoon in Seoul. First, we had the best museum tour from an English-speaking gentleman. He was engaging, friendly, and his knowledge and love of Korean history and art were inspiring. Second, the museum and its grounds are stunning. We mistimed our arrival to the museum, and got there far too early. This turned out to be fortunate, since the walk around the gardens was so beautiful. Admission is free, except for the traveling special exhibits. I highly recommend including this as part of your trip."
180,4.0,"The National Museum is an incredible free attraction that will guide you through the history of Korea and also show you about other countries in Asia too.  The museum is well laid out, monumental and uses light to highlight its treasures well.  It contains a number of national treasures and is a must if you want to see the cultural side of the country."
181,4.0,"Temporary Exhibition, permanent exhibition nice nice both of them. But, sometimes temporary exhibition ticket price was a bit expensive."
182,5.0,"My one regret from our visit to the National Museum of Korea is that we simply did not give ourselves enough time to fully enjoy it all.  You could literally spend hours upon hours exploring all the rooms in just the free exhibition building alone; so, make sure you allot enough space in your day to really roam around freely and enjoy yourself.We arrived mid-afternoon; so, we ended up only having a couple of hours to look around. We did not pay the extra fee for the paid exhibit (I believe it was a focus on European impressionists while we were there?),nor did we attend the showing of ""Les Miserables"" in the theatre; because we just simply did not have the time.  However, it would be so fun to enjoy a production in this beautiful location.  (Make sure to check the website here: http://www.museum.go.kr/site/main/index001, or call ahead {+82 2-2077-9000} to see what the paid exhibit is while you are there as it changes frequently.)The cultural side of the museum (free to the public) is beautiful inside. It's very bright, and the rooms are very easy to navigate (there are maps at the entrance in several different languages including English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (not sure what dialect, Mandarin, perhaps?).Since we were limited on time, we only got to explore a few of the rooms; so, we made sure we went through the Japanese rooms, the celadon pottery room, and the absolutely magnificent collection of Buddha iconography (I could have spent all day wandering through these rooms alone!).My most favorite piece was a massive, floor-to-ceiling tapestry depicting the Buddha. I wish I had a photo to share...it was just so incredibly beautiful!Extra Tips: Make sure you wear comfortable shoes! I wore flat sandals, and my feet were aching by the end of the day.  Tennis shoes or shoes with good cushion are greatly recommended.Eat beforehand!  There is a small convenience store and snack shop at the entrance of the museum grounds; but by the time we left (at closing time for the museum) the snack shop was closed and the convenience store was open but greatly picked over with very few choices left.As you enter or exit, climb to the top of the stairs that lead to the theatre to take in a beautiful view of Seoul! You can see all the way to Namsan (N. Seoul) Tower - it's a perfect photo op!In closing, I think it would be a real travesty to visit Seoul and not make time for the National Museum, especially if you have an interest in Korean culture at all. It's free. It's fabulous. It's really worth the time, in my opinion!"
183,5.0,"For looking at history this museum sets a global standard: exhibited pieces are very well presented, not too many together, but thematically well done. On top of that great interactive and video presentations which explain a lot of background."
184,5.0,"This is a very interesting place and every visitor must go.Easy to go, many convenient places around and nice weather"
185,3.0,"Having just visited the War Memorial (which was excellent), the National Museum in contrast was a bit of a let-down. There are some good exhibits here, no doubt, but most are largely minor, dull items and not very informational. I don't recall seeing much national treasures here as well.You have to be real students of ancient Korean history to really appreciate the details of the various dynasties. We also thought it would have been more useful to have a more general overview of the dynasties from the start, instead of just going in chronological order. We didn't spend as much time here as we thought we would, and would recommend you skip this if pressed for time."
186,5.0,"Wheather you are a korean or not, you should visit here. In huge territory, buildings, pond, and small garden are here. Except for some extra exhibition, you can come into the museum 'free'. I think, government has to make a entrance fee, but anyway, now, it's free. From paleolithic age to modern of Korea, you can see everything about tangible cultural heritage. Parking lots are ready, but i recommend a transport by subway. 2 restaurants and 1 convenience store are in the museum, but expensive. If you can, make a picnic-basket and visit here."
187,5.0,"Enjoyed my visit lots to see and experience. Give yourself plenty of time to see it all, the gardens are lovely and well worth taking time to sit and view your surroundings."
188,5.0,This beautiful building has something for everyone. The collections are well curated and can be visited quickly (2 hours for my husband and me) or at length (6 hours for our daughter who lives in Korea.) Both types of visits resulted in total satisfaction and enhanced knowledge of Korean culture and art. The restaurant was excellent and there are several options for dining on site. The gift shop is outstanding.
189,5.0,"This is my fourth time to this museum in several trips.  Always something new to discover about Korean culture.  The first floor has nice graphics to explain the time periods, three kingdoms, etc.  The celadon ceramics rooms are always an important stop.  My wife and I enjoyed a visit to the third floor tea room - try the Sipjeondaebotang tea for an unusual and very tasty picker upper (ten herbs including ginseng and angelica root).  Around the corner from the tea room are the very interesting displays of discoveries from a significant shipwreck (Chinese and Japanese). There is a special exhibit on Pompeii (a modest charge- the main museum is free) which was absolutely superb and includes more artifacts and information than you can currently obtain onsite at Pompeii - very well worth the visit!Easy to access by subway - take the Ichon stop on the light blue (#4) line and it is right there."
190,5.0,"the building in itself is a magnificent work of architecture - utilising all electronic advancements that South Korea has to offer; the curatorial design is admirable, the content less impressive; but then again - if museums are viewed more their presentation than content, this structure delivers!"
191,4.0,"This grand museum is a must visit to everyone who visits Seoul for the first time. Just by looking at the impressive building you get the feeling you're in for something great inside.It includes thousands of exhibits from Korea's history, neatly laid out in numerous galleries, scattered on two floors.While you can go through everything there is to see in the museum, it'd probably take an entire day, so you might as well go see the famous crown, scrolls and statues first and then work your way through the maze of galleries.Do not miss the museum shop, as there are some great finds there, that while not being cheap (and that's putting it mildly) – are of great quality.Entrance is free, so a visit here is simply a must.The lake outside the museum, with its lovely pagoda, provide a great photo-op.Give yourself 1-2 hours for a rushed visit, or at least half a day for a more extensive visit."
192,3.0,"This museum is arranged very well and each of the exhibits is extremely informational.  The main exhibits are also free, as well as some of the children's exhibits.  You also won't get any sideways looks for bringing young ones in the main area.  There were more than a couple less than well behaved children running around without issue. Special exhibits will cost you.  Honestly though, you could spend the entire afternoon there and still not make it through all of the resident exhibits.  It is also collocated with Yongsan Family Park, so in the warmer months you are right next to another family attraction."
193,5.0,"You will need to reserve at least four hours if you want to see most of the exhibits here. It is an extremely large collection.Besides galleries focusing on Korean history, there is also a collection of Asian exhibits featuring works from India, South-east Asia, Central Asia and Japan.A highlight was the Sinan Shipwreck Collection which reveals information about trading in the region in medieval times.A separate gallery displays items donated by private collectors to the museum. It makes one wonder how much more stuff there is kept by individuals and not shared with the public.As with many public facilities in Seoul, the building is modern and well equipped for its purpose. Guided tours are offered in several languages and electronic audio guides are also available.Best of all, it's entirely free. Even storage lockers, quite large, are free (10 won deposit for the key that you get back when you empty the locker). Toilets are spotless.Access is easy via the subway system and there's even a tunnel linking the station to the museum.There are cafes in and around the museum and, unlike those in some other countries, they are reasonably priced.Definitely worth a visit. Or even two."
194,5.0,"Very good introduction to Korean history and culture. Deep collection of paleolithic and other early artifacts. Spectacular materials from seventeenth- through early-twentieth century, nicely presented to provide background to Korea's later modernization. Much stronger on cultural than on military history, with special emphasis on cultural ties to China and Chinese intellectual traditions."
195,5.0,"Korea really knows how to show its visitors as well as its own a good cultural experience.  Museum was free to attend, with amazing works of art and history."
196,5.0,"here showed all the historical stuffs beautifully, so glad here like a place could escape from reality and take a rest and deep breathe."
197,4.0,"The Korean Collection is located on the lower floors, with the galleries in chronological order. This would be helpful to introduce visitors to the history of Korea. The museum has a big collection of ceramics, celadon, pottery more than anything, so if you are a fan of that, do visit it.Other artefacts are plentiful, but often the accompanying text/descriptions on these are not accurate, which is a ghastly oversight for a ""national"" museum. The arrows and wayfinding is also a bit confusing, as you will find yourself going against the flow quite often, the layout is not as intuitive as other museums.At the upper floors, the collections get a bit more diverse. I enjoyed the indian and indonesian exhibits, they were good in the sense that the collections were tightly curated, in terms of their style, context and themes. Also on the upper floors are some gifted collections from collectors, these always seem a bit questionable, as some artefacts were definitely acquired through less than desirable means.The multimedia in the Korean collections were splendid. Not overly done, but elegant and informational. There was one captivating piece that captured the changing seasons over a painting, it was all digital effects but done superbly. Another highlights the construction of a Buddhist grotto, that video was also well done, and really brings the awe of historical constructions to life.Other features that I enjoyed, were small sitting alcoves that overlook the museum grounds. After walking, seeing and reading, a short rest is much welcomed, and these alcoves offer a quiet place to regroup. Wifi in the museum is also strong and reliable, and there are water dispensers situated near the escalators.Getting there is also a breeze, simply get down at Ichon station and take the underground walkway, that will bring you directly to the grounds of the museum. If you feel a bit peckish, there is a well stocked CU convenience store and a small cafeteria, as well as, a food court located near the children's museum.The gift shop was also impressive, with many nice items, some reasonably priced for souvenirs, but also boasting some rich and artisanal craft goods that is well worth the money, if you fancy yourself a collecter. :)"
198,4.0,"I especially liked the full size model of the royal boat, the ceremonial drum, and the palace/temple models.  Much of the history though is repeated at the War Memorial Museum"
199,5.0,"Give yourself plenty of time to visit the 6th largest museum in the world.  First floor is of Korean early history and will easily take a couple of hours.  The 2nd and 3rd floor are of Korean art, and will consume as much time as the first.  In addition, there are other museums attached to this complex."
200,5.0,"Admission is free. Yes, there is a lot of old pottery. The crown of the Kings of Silla was on display as well. They have one of the most beautiful collections of celadon in two rooms. The open design of the place is worth mentioning too. No overstuffed rooms here."
201,5.0,"Take your time it's beautifully displayed, just magnificent.  We didn't have enough time to really see it all but what we did see was enchanting."
202,4.0,"the collection and the building are impresive but: 1 place is crowded, I do not recommend going during weekends, 2. To many kids taking photos of almost everything, 3. skip the prehistoric part. Also you will probably have to have one day for that, museum is huge and there is also a big park, where you can spend some time:)."
203,4.0,"Maybe the hugest.  Cool building - esp at night. Terrible audio support. Enormous collection. 300000 pieces, I believe.  Who can see that much?"
204,4.0,The building and supporting space of this museum facilitates a serene environment for this museum and despite being holiday season you do not feel crowded or rushed to take in the artefacts and displays. There are some quieter spots to sit on the higher floors in the corners of the museum to overlook the gardens.
205,5.0,"For museum lovers a real treat.  A great introduction to Korean culture.  As you approach the museum you immediately notice the beautiful landscaped garden/planters and artifully designed lights leading up to the entrance.  Inside you are greeted by high ceilings, streams of natural light and spacious exhibit rooms.  The museum is huge and you could easily spend 4-5 hours"
206,5.0,Loved this museum. Give yourself 3-4 hours. If you are English speaking be sure to take the one hours english speaking tour in order to get acquainted with the museum.
207,2.0,"As you approach the National Museum of Korea raising above you on the hill the first thing you notice is its beauty and monumental size.  As you enter the spacious foyer it soars into the sky and the exhibition halls are spacious with high ceilings and wide connecting hallways.  Elevators and escalators swiftly move you between the 3 floors of exhibitions.  City buses service the museum and a subway station (Line 4) is a short walk away.  Entrance is FREE.Programs are available in a number of languages and exhibits are marked in Hangul (Korean) and English.  Our visit was focused on the works of artist Kim Hong Do (Painter of the Wind drama) famous artist of the Joseon Dynasty.  Unfortunately only a few of his original works were on display and others were reproductions or photograph projections.The museum leaves you wanting for more, as the exhibits are profoundly deficient in actual historical artifacts.  It seems it is more about the buildings architecture than the artifacts in the exhibits.  If this is your first introduction to Korean history you will come away with an unfavorable opinion of the exhibits and no real understanding of the 5000 year history of Korea and its people."
208,4.0,Learned a lot of stuff from our tour guide when we went here. There were 4 areas in the museum and we only went to one as the place is very big and may take most of our time in our tour. There are small descriptions on each of the displayed artifacts but hearing things from our guide made more sense. The place is pretty huge but their are signs and stuff so you won't get lost. You can learn a lot here about Korean history so it is a must go.
209,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, this museum is decent.  The only thing is that, it pales in comparison to the brilliant art museum, and war memorial - both of which have good collections of historical items themselves.So, I would give this one a miss, just because other museums / locations are better.  Even if you had time to see ONE museum, I would go to the war memorial."
210,3.0,"If you love most museums then you'd probably find this one pretty good.  However, I think it's a bit boring, there are no spectacular or particularly fascinating exhibits.  I love science museums and natural history museums to give you an idea of my interests - but this one was too dull.  A lot of the exhibits were the same and I think you can enjoy Korean culture more by visiting temples and palaces.  However, the paleolithic section was interesting - purely because of the age of the artefacts and not the Korean history."
211,5.0,"We took the subway. Got off at Ichon on the Jungang line (aqua). It is a covered walk almost all the way to the museum entrance. Main museum entrance is free. It is a stunning building from the inside, and all the displays are well signed posted in English. We tried to get the MP3 audio guide, but there weren't any available at the time. Apparently they can be booked on line at the museums website, may be worth doing.We spent a great 3 hours there on a drizzly day. Well worth it, if you get sick of just seeing palaces and shops galore."
212,5.0,"This is a museum with an extensive collection of not just Korean art and artifacts, but from other Asian countries as well. It was the last sight we saw before returning home and well worth it."
213,3.0,Beautiful part of town and a lovely walk through the complex.Displays however are quite poor.You can only get so excited about 2 and a half floors of pots...add a Buddha or two and you have finished.
214,5.0,This is the place to go to understand the Kirean culture and history. Many historic pieces starting from the pre historical era create a mysterious atmosphere. The sculptures were unique. It's a must see for anyone visiting Seoul who is interested in Korean history.
215,4.0,"The building itself is a piece of art, surrounded by trees and a pond. There's a free entry for the permanent exhibitions."
216,4.0,"I was amazed by the quality of the free exhibition and gained so much new information about the Korean history and culture. There's overwhelmingly large collection of historical items and one day is hardly enough to see all the 3 floors. The second, art related, floor was though not my favourite and skipped that almost completely. The acient history up to around 1500s was covered very well, but there's some gaps we could say from 1700-1900m so perhaps that's something to imporove during the next years."
217,3.0,"Given that this is the National Museum of Korea, it seemed a little short on substance. Entry into the permanent exhibitions was free - the current additional  French Musee d'Orsay display required a fee. The galleries were well laid out  and there was a good accompanying map of the museum in English. Given our European background the Korean Calligraphy and painting gallery was too much for us, but we did admire some of the marvellous ceramics in the Sculpture and Craft Hall. Seemed lacking in atmosphere"
218,5.0,Easy to go there with the subway (line 4 : Ichon station). Majestic entrance and pond. The museum is free. Korea's history is exposed in grand rooms. Visiting the museum helps understading the ancien way of life in Korea
219,5.0,We loved this Museum and we only covered a small part of it. It is a spacious magnificent building and one that Korea and Seoul can be justly proud. It is set out as a traditional museum with exhibits displayed in cases. There is good signage and information in English. You really need to allow several hours to do this place justice which we didn't to our regret.
220,5.0,"The museum was architecturally lovely and had beautiful archeological findings. Probably better if  you know some Korean history. We only made it as far as the second floor and liked the furniture section best.   Our group enjoyed even more the performance area outside where children were dancing (on a Saturday afternoon).  I went to the Musee d'Orsay touring collection of impressionist paintings across the patio and was wow'd.  Don't know how long it will be in town, but this was many gorgeous pieces with some little-seen and unfamiliar paintings by well-known painters such as Gaugin, Monet (several), Lautrec, Pizarro, Rousseau, plus a few large realist portraits, and a section on the building of the Eiffel Tower. Well worth the $12 admission."
221,4.0,This was a great place to go to soak up the culture of the Koreans dating back to 1300BC! It is an amazing building with three levels of culture and information. It was also free which was not expected but great for the traveller on a budget (like me). My only issue was that it was a museum and I personally do not find them that interesting. I only went because a local suggested it - but do not get me wrong i do not regret it and would go again if given the chance. If you are really into museums this is for you - you could really spend an entire day! If museums are not your thing i still recommend you going to check it out as you can learn so much about the history of Korea.
222,5.0,A well laid out museum. Entrance was free.Fascinating insight into Korean history and culture. We loved the pottery on display.
223,5.0,Free tours in English and an outstanding collection of art. There is a huge stone Pagoda on the first floor that extends up through the atrium. Fine examples of Korean art  and culture through the ages.
224,4.0,"My husband and I visited the museum and it is very expansive and has great information. Many of the descriptions are in multiple languages but the audio guide is much more informative and has not just the history but information on how the items were created, used, etc. We were able to download the iphone app which has 2 of the 1/6th of the museum in English and they were great although a little cheesy, especially for the adults. We weren't able to get an audio guide as they were all used so if the app had more information/rooms or we had audio guides, I would have rated it a 5 as that was the only thing I think could be better.The history of Korea is fascinating and I liked that they related it back to today as well so you can see some of the ways that each of the different eras or regions influenced what we know today as South Korea. There were also exhibits on Japan, India and SE Asia and also an incredible amount of private donations. Some of them lacked information on the period from which the artifacts came from but otherwise, it was great.The museum is huge so either plan for 4-5 hours or plan the places that you want to see ahead of time so you spend more time there either on the tour or with an audio guide and just browse the rest."
225,5.0,"If you're looking to learn more about the history and culture of the Korean Peninsula, you will not be disappointed. The collection is carefully presented in a detailed chronological timeline of the history of the peninsula in the past couple millennia. The free touchscreen audio guides were awesome to get even more insights on the artifacts history.The architecture of the museum and their beautiful surrounding gardens and park I think are also an attraction on their own. The food court has several options Asian and Western and is actually pretty high quality.It is no wonder is a popular attraction and all the praise they get is well deserved."
226,5.0,Its an wonderful experience . we have to give  full marks to the Korean government. All 3 floors are very well maintained. It should be a model for the whole world. Free entry is another plus point.
227,4.0,"If you like ancient stuff and history. This is a place to come. They keep thing very well. Place is big, clean, and quiet. Lots of thing to see."
228,5.0,Learn a lot of history and get to see a lot of collection. Really nice place to visit! Do consider coming here!!
229,3.0,"The Korean Museum is by far one of the worst major Museums in the world. (I said major, calm down.) A culture that claims to be almost as old as China, has barely enough history to fill one single museum and portions of what is there is art and not really that historical. I felt almost let down as I love Korean history and its strange intertwining with Chinese history, but I just felt let down. If you know nothing about Korea make the stop, if you are fairly well versed do not bother spending more than an hour or so and plan accordingly as it is not really a neighborhood that welcomes further exploration.."
230,3.0,This is definitely more popular with the women as many of its best exhibits are ceramics. The best feature is the very modern structure which is the reason I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars. This was part of a tour and I am sure they took us here because it was free.
231,4.0,"National Museum of Korea is the 6th largest museum in the world. This is a great place to explore for the museum lovers. Access to museum is fairly straight forward. Head to Ichon station on line 4, there is a walkway that link to the museum. We enjoyed our time visiting the museum. Exhibitions were nicely arranged. With different theme and interactive way to convey the message. In overall we find it worth visiting for those who intend to learn more about Korea."
232,5.0,"if you appreciate art of all mediums and enjoy fine art museums, this is the place to be both on a rainy day and a sunny day. The grounds are stunning as well. There's a wealth of exhibits, and a separate children's museum as well. Very family-friendly or perfect for singles and couples. Allow yourself time here as it's a large-scale museum."
233,5.0,"This museum is located in Yongsan Park and access through the Ichon subway station on line 4.  On the way from the subway exit to the museum, you walk through a ""moving"" museum of lights and designs. Very innovative and creative! The museum is huge and impressive as you approach it.  The large lobby, hallways, and room throughout the museum makes it a very comfortable place to take your time and enjoy the history.  At the time of our visit, there was a special exhibit on Taoism and Korean culture but we ran out of time and did not get to see this.  We spent a good 3 hours covering the 1st floor only.  The displays and explanations gave a good sense of Korean history dating from prehistory times through the Joseon dynasty to early modern history.  The confluence of cultures Korean, Japan and China through trade was interesting.  Good place for people interested in history.  Admission is free and recommend to use the free guided tours"
234,2.0,"My wife and I were very excited to visit this museum - especially once we saw the building.  After we arrived and started the self-tour, we lost interest within 30 minutes.  Unless you have some awareness of Korean history and a lot of interest in it, I don't recommend this museum."
235,4.0,This museum was definitely huge and full of artifacts but it wasn't my favorite place to visit. Maybe we should have taken a tour instead of just walking around on our own but I found it long. If you enjoy history this is the place for you. There is a lot to see so be prepared to spend quite a bit of time here. The building is impressive and very modern.
236,5.0,This is a huge building. The exhibitions gave us a good understanding of the history of the emperor's era of korean. Good place to kill half day time.
237,5.0,"This museum is unbelievable in every way; whomever the architect was, he/she did an outstanding job.  It is massive but fits beautifully into it's landscape;  it is sleek, modern,  brightened by daylight inside, well laid out, and beyond our ability so stay more than about 2 hours. The structure is one of the 6 largest museums in the world. It starts with the prehistoric age and works it's way down to the end of the last Korean dynasty, but shows all of the conflicting influences that were absorbed by what eventually became Korea.What fascinated us greatly were the vast number of primary school student groups who were studying with their tutors - on a Saturday.We had been told that such educational situations were vital to future success in school in Seoul, at least.  They all appeared interested and eager - inspiring, to be sure."
238,4.0,"Amazingly huge complex and easy to get lost. Should go with a plan on what you want to see and do, otherwise might spend hours wondering around. Very beautiful complex and modern facility that really depicts the value of Korean history and culture. Artifacts were neatly presented and each had a story to tell. Would be nice to have more English translations as a lot were in Korean. Foodcourt was a good place to take a break and had a good selection of cuisines. Can get a bit rowdy with kids running amok during lunchtime! Highly recommended to soak up on Korean history and culture."
239,5.0,"We were grateful for a tour given in English which gave a brief overview of Korean history. We learned about the differences among Buddism in China, Japan, and Korea. Saw beautiful ancient works of art. Be aware that the tour took about 1.5 hours and was not geared for children. We did visit the children's museum. It was well done with many hands-on actvities, but had little English for nonKorean speakers. The children's museum is free, but tickets are required to help control the number in that museum. I would recommend the food in the cafeteria."
240,4.0,"Walking up to the Museum you could see the extensive details placed in building the museum, with gardens, pillar of poles with a reflecting pool and a pagoda with celadon tile roof as the focal point, really awesome to see.Being interested to know how Korea came about we went directly to the prehistory and Ancient history gallery, I am fascinated with all the artifacts they kept that it tells the story of all the periods so dramatically.We went also to the third floor to look at the collections of celadon vase and other blue and white porcelains. Overall, I enjoyed our visit here and if we happen to be back in Korea will surely visit again"
241,5.0,"This museum is very comprehensive, with good rental audio commentary. I think it is a must in Seoul. The museum building is also impressive."
242,2.0,So many teenagers behaving terribly  - running around yelling. It seemed like they were using this free place as a hang out.
243,5.0,"Beautiful museum, with a well curated collection that nicely tells the story of various art forms through time without being overwhelmingly large.  Free admission too."
244,4.0,"I am absolutely impressed by the incredible amount of care, detail and thought that went into creating this space starting from its modern architecture, created particularly to showcase some of the most important relics of Korean and Asian history without overshadowing them.The surrounding gardens incorporate the outdoor exhibit into nature while featuring many trees and flowers that are native to the region and known as symbols of the country and culture. The collection is presented as a long chronological story in a very accurate and sophisticated way. They offer a guided audio/interactive touchscreen tablet tour free of charge with in depth descriptions and information of all the works on display which I recommend.It is a large space so depending on the pace it may be from a half day to a full day to visit, especially if visiting the gardens.They do also have a food court, decent for being fast food. There is also a formal restaurant we didn't have the time to try.Worth the visit for those that would like to learn more about the culture from a historical perspective."
245,5.0,"This relatively new addition to the Seoul scene offers not only beautifully displayed exhibits about Korea and other parts of Asia but also stunning architecture and exquisite landscaping.  The 3-story building is immense with exhibits located in more intimate rooms off a huge main hall, which is open to the third-floor ceiling.Admission is free and English-speaking staff wait to answer questions on the first floor. Items are for sale (most are a bit pricey) in a large gift shop on the first floor and in smaller areas throughout the building. There are also a traditional tea room, at least one cafe and a restaurant in the building. The garden holds a large restaurant, too, with mostly set menus of traditional food. Though expensive, we found the fare here to be delicious.It is possible for museum lovers to spend hours in the museum. But many may prefer to pick and choose from the excellent floor plan and simply get an overview of what is offered. We visited for the first time three years ago but only had an hour to spare. We found ourselves impressed enough to return to see more a few days ago.    The museum is easily reached by metro."
246,4.0,"The museum is very modern and items well displayed. It is very large and plan what you want to see, as it would take many days to see it all"
247,5.0,"A lot to see, very clean, very big, a lot of kids running around from school groups. If you like history and other countries culture, pay for a guide and tour through this museum.  many levels, and many sections on each level which separates each time in the history of Korea."
248,4.0,The Seoul National Museum was the first stop of the City Tour that we went into. It was nice and educational but not really compulsory if you're not into history.
249,5.0,"An excellent institution. Very focused on Korean and SE Asian art and they have done a fabulous job in display as well as collection. We spent 5 hours and have seen everything on every floor. It is big bit not nearly as big or overwhelming or versatile like Louvre or Met.Start on the third floor with excellent SE Asian and Central Asian collection. Nowhere else in the world I have seen any better Central Asian artifacts. One point I have noted that the entire SE and East Asian collection was done in last 10 years or so. Curious me asked where they have purchased their stuff from. The staff at the front desk did not know the answer but in a few days NY Times answered my question by publishing an article about the rich thieves in India who have been selling the national treasures to museums and private collectors world wide. Nevertheless, it is a great collection. The Japanese section was weak but nice. Try the Tea House at the end of this gallery. Wonderful setting and inexpensive for a museum tea shop.Rest of the third floor and most of second was Buddhist art and Korean ceramics and porcelain. Yet another fabulous Celadon collection. First floor was pre historic artifacts and Korean history. This is the most crowded floor and for me was the least attractive one but it is my personal taste. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING has English explanation. Yes there are more Korean explanation but the main points were explained in English for every single object. Avoid the restaurant on the first floor. It is inexpensive but only one place in Seoul where we had really BAD food.We are planning to go to Korea next year and yes we will come back to this museum again."
250,5.0,3 floors organized into period rooms of history.  Especially intriqued by the Chinese ship artifact room highlighting trade items from centuries ago.
251,5.0,"The relatively new museum is like a nice serene compound. The landscaping and facilities are very well maintained. There is so much to see here and you should put aside a good 3 hours or so if you really want to soak in everything. I never have time to see everything as I end up running short on time and rushing to see most of the displays.  I hope one day I can go back on a nice clear day, enjoy the gardens and take my time actually reading all of the displays. I think I would need at least 4 hours."
252,4.0,"The building is stunning and it contains artifacts to give you an idea about the history, art and culture of Korea. And it is free!Look for the brush paintings, Silla Dynasty gold crown, pottery, oldest calligraphy scroll, huge stone pagoda, armour (for horses too!) - alos enjoyed a Korean meal in the cafe for a reasonable price."
253,3.0,"Nice location - catch the subway / metro here.Alot to see, but most articles, have none or limited english information.We joined an english spoken tour  and really enjoyed the volume of information about Korean history that we gained in the 2 hours...l2,30 pm they had the english tour"
254,5.0,"Excellent musuem for an understanding of Korean history particularly the Goreo and Joseon dynasties. Beautifully laid out, with some priceless treasures such as a 10 tier pagoda, wonderful ceramics, metal work and Buddha statues."
255,4.0,This museum was free !! It has lots of ancient korean artifacts that share alot of koreas past. Highly recommended.
256,5.0,"I love the National Museum of Korea. I learned a lot more during the 1-day visit to the National Museum of Korea, so much that I understand about the origin of Korean and also their similarity with Chinese!"
257,5.0,"This museum is enormous, the collections are impressive, and they offer a free English tour which is great for putting things into perspective and explaining the history of Korea. A must see!"
258,5.0,"We never made it off the ground floor, bu that is where the bulk of Korean history is displayed.  Easily a whole day experience, or more.  Definitely visit."
259,4.0,"When you do have time to travel the whole country, a visit to the Museum will provide you a good understanding of S.Korea history and culture. The Museum is very modern and well designed. It is worth a trip there."
260,5.0,Fascinating historical museum. Excellent selection of exhibits - the sections on prehistory of Korea and Buddhist art particularly so. (I also recommend the museum food court.. Good value and delicious Korean dished are available. Useful as the museum is not close to restaurants and you could spend many hours at this museum as there is so much to see.)
261,5.0,"National Museum of Korea used to be small and not worth a visit when I was young and still living in Seoul. But that has changed 180 degrees. The new museum is incredibly well organized, and FREE to enter for the part that is most interesting to me at least (the Korean collection). Just to see the Korean side, I'd suggest devoting at least half a day and suggest frequent rests in between as there's a lot to see. The food inside is a bit on the expensive side, but the Korean fast food outside the museum (before the stairs to the museum building) is affordable and quick if you want to eat a bite before entering and after exiting."
262,5.0,"We took the Metro from down town to the Museum. The museum  has beautiful grounds, and beautiful buildings. Well worth a visit when in Seoul."
263,5.0,"We've come here on three separate occasions - one visit for each floor. There are that many artefacts! This is not just about Korean history, either - there are pieces from all over Asia, and you relaly get to see how spiritual movements and civilisations moved and changed through history. There are lots of information boards in surprisingly well-translated English as well. A wonderful free excursion for a few (or many) hours."
264,3.0,"The building is huge and grand. It is relatively sparse inside. There is a comprehensive display of Korean history and artifacts, from various periods. It is interesting but nothing extraordinary. perhaps the best thing is that it is free."
265,3.0,"We loved the building - it is so large and spacious. However, the displays were not so interesting. If you like Korean pottery and ceramics, you will enjoy it. We had a nice dinner in the cafe that was good value."
266,5.0,"Free entry, and a large panorama of Korean fine culture, from stone age to contemporary time, via middle age.À must go !"
267,5.0,"the building alone is worth seeing, the exibits are logically arranged and well displayed.There is no entry fee."
268,4.0,Visited here on our first day in Korea.  It's a beautiful museum of Korean history that goes back to prehistoric times until the start of the 20th century.  Great place to find out all about Korea
269,3.0,"beautiful museum, in nice setting, but it was ok.  Most of their displays were in korean, so I lost interest when I got there.  If they want people to know about their history or culture, they should display in multiple language, I guess that's just me."
270,3.0,"My husband and I made it around Seoul to see quite a few museums, and this one ranks at the bottom of our list. The size of this museum is the most impressive thing about it, The other main positives are that its free and that there is a fair amount of English throughout it. I would recommend spending more time at other museums rather than coming here."
271,2.0,"Before writing this review, I have to state that I have been to some of the world's best museums. I have been to the Field Museum in Chicago, Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC. So, I am using these two museums as my yardstick.Firstly, the building that houses the museum is impressive. The architecture and design put into it is great. But for a national museum, it is wanting. A lot of the exhibits belong to prominent Korean individuals. And the exhibits were so far apart from each other that it gave me the impression that the exhibitors were trying to ""fill"" the exhibition rooms. In short, there was more ""empty"" space than exhibits. And almost two floors on one side of the building were devoted to pictures and statutes of Buddha (no intention to be disrespectful) but seriously, how many statues of the same thing could a person see without being bored and two floors of it?If you have been to some of the top museums in the world, give this a miss. And, Yes, the museum to King Sejong is much better which is in front of the US Embassy."
272,5.0,"If you want to know more about Korea, you should go there.It's huge but you will never be bored. Plus it's new, clean and has an English audioguide of course, so don't be afraid. ;-)"
273,4.0,"very nice place to know Korean history, like the architecture design, food court is not bad, if you want to have audio guide take your passport and credit card (with your printed name)"
274,4.0,"I think everyone with the slightest interest in Korean culture should visit this museum. It has an emphasis on stone age tools and (non-stone age) ceramics, which is understandable as Korea is particularly strong in both. There are sections dedicated to Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Central Asian art, which can be surprising at first but which help to see Korean culture in context. One minor complaint is that some of the ""star"" (National Treasure-class) exhibits can be difficult to find (e.g. we had to look hard for the Pensive Buddha). While some of the artifacts on display (think horse and rider teapot) are indeed stunning, I did have the feeling sometimes that the great size and quality and the obvious massive economic expense invested in this museum might be somewhat out of proportion to the collection it houses, but I suppose this can be the result of a) much Korean heritage having been destroyed by stronger foreign invaders, and b) a possibly large part of it being found currently across the border in the North? We thought the museum shops were very interesting but it might have been better to merge them into one bigger shop instead of the three different-size shops stocking pretty much the same products although the biggest one in a larger range version, which is not exactly helpful. As for restaurants, without having actually used them, the smaller (Korean) one on the third floor looked really inviting, with both beautiful views and décor, whereas the larger, mostly-Italian one on the ground floor had something of a soulless cafeteria appearance and we were glad we didn't need to eat there."
275,4.0,"This is a very informative, and big museum in South Korea (Seoul).  This museum is very good museum, and can be compared to the Smithsonian Museums in Washington DC USA.  This is definitely worth going.  This is a must see.If you do not speak English, and seek an English guided tour, call for the scheduled tours (free), as they at least have two daily.I am sure that they are also able to accommodate for other languages also."
276,3.0,the building is big. We went there on Mon but it was closed; it's not stated in the website that the museum if closed on Monday!
277,5.0,This was part of our tout and I thought here we go But there is so much to see I was surprised I totaled enjoyed it it was great
278,5.0,"A great way to learn abour Korean Royal Dynasties, history and art, largely neglected in the West. Beautiful view of Seoul from the plaza in front of the museum."
279,4.0,"This is a huge museum that has something for everyone. The location is a bit difficult to find without a tourist map. However, on arrival you could easily lose yourself inside. This is one of the few places in Seoul that preserves Korean culture and doesn't exploit it."
280,3.0,It's free and something to do on a rainy day... which was our plan but some of the early historical halls were closed for renovation.
281,4.0,"The building is huge and spacious, it contains many country historical item. We went there mainly due to rainy weather thus visiting museum is the ideal indoor activities. The admission is free. The arrangement of the item is very systematic and organized according to country and religious. A part from that, advance technology such as video display and record is used so make visitor get close understanding of the history. I would strongly recommend it for history seekers."
282,5.0,Absolutely brilliant a  real show stopper. Collections of Buddhist Art and Ceramics not to be missed.
283,5.0,"This museum is truly worthy of being called the national museum.  The setting is excellent and the design really incorporates the building within the city's landscape. There are good snack and dining options, and great views abound.  The collection is top notch, and the venue is one of the best sight seeing opportunities in Seoul.  It is a short walk from a subway stop, so it is easy to get to, and it was free and open late the night we were there."
284,5.0,"This is a massive place (think Brit Museum, London, on that scale) and you can’t really do it justice in a few hours. So it’s probably advisable to study the layout online and decide what you want to see, before you go, especially if you’re only going to visit it once.We didn’t do that and although we hired the MP3 audio guide for 1,000 won we still got rather confused and couldn’t really follow things in a logical sequence.At 2.30pm, we took the free one-hour tour in English. Our knowledgeable guide, Agnus, showed us some of the highlights, including a selection of ancient bells. She explained the design and significance of each one, as well as the differences between the Japanese, Korean and Chinese bells.The museum has two shops, a food bar, coffee bar and even a Family Mart superette on site. Entrance is free. We especially liked the spacious and airy layout of the place, again, not unlike the Brit Museum in London. Just in front of the main entrance is a plaza and what looks like a man-made lake. You can sit there with your sandwich or a takeaway coffee and enjoy the view. It was especially pleasant on a warm spring afternoon in April.Clearly much effort and expense has gone into this significant cultural and historical facility and the Koreans can be rightly proud of it. It’s ultra modern, only having opened seven years ago and you shouldn’t miss it on your trip to Seoul. To get there, just catch the subway on the blue line and get off at Inchon station. From the station, it’s an easy 10 minutes walk to the museum along a well signposted route."
285,3.0,"It a nice walk from Myeong-dong to the NMK, but the exhibits were rather dry and mundane.  If you are interested in studying Korean history in depth, its probably a ideal place, but for a causal visitor, it can be repetitive and confusing."
286,4.0,"I thought it had beautiful scenery and there was a lot to see. There are different floors of the museum that have different things on each floor. One floor was Korean art, the other one was the rulers. I would definitely go again!"
287,5.0,A very large museum where you can spend an entire day.  Many artifacts are on display and most have English translations on the sign.   Make sure you drop by if you have any interest at all in history.
288,4.0,"A 3 storey building with amazing collection of artefacts that represents Korea's history and development. Majority of the sites are free of charge except those who are on special exhibition. It is spacious and wide. You can take your time at each of the exhibit without feeling rushed at. The Subway station to alight will be at Ichon Station, Seoul Subway line 4 & Jungang line, Exit #2."
289,5.0,I love national museums and have seen some truly fabulous ones.  This is now in my top five.  Beautiful modern huge complex with the various Korean themes and arts all so well presented and displayed.  If you want to really learn about Korea and it's people this is a must visit
290,5.0,Worth visiting just to see the building architecture.  Superb collections.  Free 2-hour English tour was fantastic.
291,5.0,This museum gives one an insight to the History of Korea and is well worth the 3 or more hours to really learn from the visit.
292,4.0,"This is a big complex so give yourself plenty of time to visit. The buildings are situated in a lovely park area, refreshments are available in a cafe.We used the audio only guide in English but we think the audio plus visual would have been better. The exhibits are good, lots of English and the audio was very informative. Learnt a lot about Korean history.As the museum is a far distance from the centre it is located close to a train station,but taxis in Seoul very cheap so both methods of transport good to use."
293,5.0,"On one of our last days of a 3-week visit to Korea and Japan, we've spent most of the afternoon in the beautiful and spacious National Museum in Seoul. Besides learning an awful lot about Korean history, you'll see some amazing artwork, shiny national treasures, and a wonderful collection of buddha statues. All this is free of charge (only the temp exhibition is charged, but this exhibition is optional). The museum also provides free English guides that will give visitors a one-hour tour past all the highlights. These free tours run twice a day; the afternoon tour starts at 2:30pm, the morning tour starts around 11am if I remember correctly.Tip: If you're looking to send postcards to your family abroad, the museum's main gift shop (to the left of the main hall) is the perfect place to do it. They've got a nice selection of postcards and the postbox is right next to its entrance.Another tip: Visit the restaurant. When the museum closes around 6pm, you've still got plenty of time to grab some (pretty tasty) food at the museum's restaurant. I had some delicious Bimbap for only 7000KRW."
294,3.0,"The permanent exhibit of the museum if free to visit (please check opening hours, since they vary almost from day to day). It has 3 floors and unfortunately it doesn't present many interesting artifacts. It has a ""tea house"" on the 3rd floor, which has a nice atmosphere, and where you can enjoy a nice refreshing drink / tea."
