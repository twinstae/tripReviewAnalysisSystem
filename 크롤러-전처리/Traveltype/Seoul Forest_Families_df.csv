Deer feeding was prohibited, not sure if permanent or temporary... Large territory to explore with lots of pretty views and photo opportunities. Not sure it's a good option as a tourist destination, but if you want to spend some time with kids in a park and explore the territory, then it's the place to go."

There are so many areas to visit but it takes a lot of walking to reach each part. And some directions won’t lead you to what is indicated. The only area we enjoyed most was the Tulip Garden where flowers are in bloom and in different happy colors. There are even cherry blossom trees in between. It felt refreshing and very calming. If you are a nature lover, you can try and visit Seoul Forest."
2,5.0,I went in spring so it was really chill bring your mat and food to picnic and chill there! the cherry blossoms were in full bloom really just gorgeous !
3,4.0,"Lovely park with fun slides and play areas for kids, interesting areas like the deer corral and insect rooms, and lots of lovely greenery. Some of the signage had us looping around trying to get to certain areas and I ended up having to use GPS map to get to some parts."
4,5.0,"This is a very large park in Seoul. People who live in Seoul come and rest here. Many family visitors. It's not bad for tourists. But, there's nothing fantastic.- The entrance from the east seems to be main gate with a parking lot. 10~15 min walk from Seoul Forest Metro Station(Bundang Line).- Huge park. Bicycle rental is recommended to take a look quickly. Ttareungi(Seoul Bike) is much cheaper than bike rental shops.- Tourists may have enough fun when there's an event like a concert.- Snack bar on the west is not cheap. They have good snacks like squids, potatoes, sausages, etc., though.- There are rabbit farms, carp ponds, deer farms, butterfly farms, greenhouse, etc."
5,4.0,"It is a very modest place where mostly elders go to exercise. There are also deers that you can feed by buying their food from a vending machine. There is also a piano for the public that anyone can use. However, you will not find much activities to do especially during the weekends."
6,5.0,lovely place especially when its hot. lots of places to cool down rest and enjoy the sound of trees. Allow atleast 4 hours to find all there is ...and there is loads for children and adults to enjoy

9,5.0,"We went to Seoul Forest on a Sunday morning.  It was accessible by subway, and there were many families with young children in the park playground and strolling around.  The place was clean and well maintained, and there were bikes and four wheelers available for rent.  We rented a few although they were quite pricey, and we had an hour of fun biking around the huge park.  The weather was cloudy and cool, perfect for playing on the lawn. We brought along a frisbee and inflatable ball, and had a great time playing together.  There were also cafes and restaurants nearby and we had lunch there.  We walked to the Deer enclosure to view the deers, but the feed for the animals were already sold out by the time we reach (around 3pm). Nonetheless, we had a great day at Seoul Forest and it is a great place for a family outing."
10,5.0,"A must see place if you have time in Seoul. The place is good for picnics and families to enjoy the spring weather and greenery. Further in, you can see deers and rabbits etc in the park. The cherry blossom trees lined the entire stretch inside which was beautiful. Great place for photos."
11,4.0,Came here for spring and it was a great sight as the park is lined with alot of flowers. Park is quite big and didn't manage to explore around. Best to go in the morning before it gets too crowded. Defn recommended for those that likes to go for a stroll or a walk. Located near to subway station - Seoul Forest- .
12,5.0,"Beautiful park, great place for the kids to run around and exercise.  They have very unusual playground equipment, wonderful stuff I've seen no where else.  The insect garden was cool and we all loved feeding the deer.  Easy to get to by the metro."
13,4.0,I would  definitely go back there.. One of my favorite place in korea.. too cold but that's fine i enjoyed the romantic ambiance of the place❤️
14,3.0,"We went there with 2 other families, together there are 6 children and 6 adults. My younger daughter enjoyed the cycling. However, I find that the bicycle was not very stable. One of the other kids had fallen off the bicycle when riding. But in the forest there is a big playground which the kids enjoyed very much. They also enjoyed seeing the deer. We saw a lot of locals having picnic which I can understand why subsequently as there is not much eating  places."
15,3.0,the forest is clean but not so much to see except feel the good breeze of the air and so good to travel on spring season
16,4.0,"Nice park suitable for whole family have picnic at here. The park is very big, also have some animal you can see. Go there at the sunset almost can see the good view. And can spend one whole day in there. If you have time, this is the good choice to go to enjoy this relax place."
17,5.0,"This was very nice to find in the huge city of Seoul.  A nice peaceful place, not just another mega shopping mall.  We enjoyed our visit in October 2016.  We walked through the forest and enjoyed the fall trees, though they were just starting to turn. We really enjoyed feeding the deer.  The butterfly house only had one species of butterfly so that was a bit disappointing.  The forest is easy to get to using the subway.  Weather was warm enough to just wear a t-shirt with a sweater over top.  Ideal for all ages.  There are play areas on site for those with children."
18,5.0,Promenaders would like trot around the park. They also can visit small park of deers. Han river side walking trail is very nice to enjoy scenic river view.
19,4.0,"Step away from the city for some peace and quiet. Rent a bike or tricycle. Check out the deer and ecopark. Walk, sit, play, relax. Enjoy."
20,5.0,Had a blast with my wife and two daughters.  Spend two 2.5 hours there.  A wonderful relaxing environment!
21,5.0,"So serene and beautiful. Lots of things for children. Check out the splash pad, the deer park, bike rentals and the playgrounds! There's a million things to do here. Great date activity and great day with the kiddos."
22,5.0,Went with the kids for the afternoon. Was able to rent a bicycle with only a driver's licence. There are enough activities to keep kids occupied for a few hours including feeding deers a park for children and a water playground.
23,5.0,A good walkGet out and walk~ the only thing that ruined it for me was the noisy kids otherwise it was a beautiful Forest it's like you left the city of Seoul ~
24,5.0,"This is the second time I came. I rented the two-seater pedal cart from two different shop. The one with the heart-shape plate is cheaper with hourly rental of 12,000 KRW but requires passport deposit in 2013, The other shop's rental for one hour is 16,000 KRW with no ID deposit but they gave my child a water guy toy after I returned the cart. We always pedal to the deer park to feed the deers who will basically licked the feed off your palm. Just be careful as there's a gentle slope on the final stretch near the deer park as it's quite crowded. Remember the brake when going down the slope.There's an eco playground, sand playground, lots of nice modern statues in the park. Both parents and children will enjoy the park."
25,5.0,"This is probably one of my favourite areas in Seoul. I hope it’s not going to be inundated with people the next time I visit. The place is huge and it takes a long time to really cover all of it. Unfortunately, by the time we arrived almost all of the cherry blossoms were gone :( But we still managed to take photos of really nice flowers and just the general scenery which is beautiful. It was pretty chilly when we were there but it was a comfortable walk around the park. A lovely place to gather with friends and have picnics. Will be back here again next time!"
26,5.0,"Seoul Forest is a lovely getaway from the hustle of Seoul. Note that there is some construction activity near the subway so you might need to walk for a bit before you head to the entrance. Same goes when you are exiting too. There's an information centre from where we picked a map. Headed towards the deer park but got distracted by the lovely sakura and the insect house enroute. There's a deer food machine just a wee bit away from the deer park. The deer looked much bigger than expected and be wary of the aggressive ones which are all too happy to grab the paper cup from your hands whilst you are feeding them. There are different parks within Seoul Forest so we then headed towards the open area where people were sitting on picnic mats and enjoying themselves. There's eateries at a mall near the skating park at Gate 3 so if you haven't bought anything to eat with you, you can head there. There's also a eating joint (but unfortunately all in Korean) near the waterside area. We spent a lovely half day here. Highly recommended."
27,4.0,"It's a nice park with playground, a place to see and feed the deer.we bought Gimbak before going to Seoul forest, and have our lunch there.didnt see eateries around. good to bring food or snack if bring small children (esp after they finish playing at playground).playground to deer is about 20 mins slow walk."
28,5.0,"We recently went to Seoul Forest when we were in Seoul for a vacation last Dec. And we did not regret the decision at all.The journey there is pretty straightforward.. There is a station ""Seoul Forest"" on the Bandung line.. from the station, just follow the signs to the park..NOTE : when we were there last Dec, there was a major construction going on in the front of the park..The park is very big and it is free to enter.. the only cost needed is the deer feed for the lovely deers... i think it is about W100 per cup of feed...Make sure you have enough time for the nice scenery, playground and to visit the deers.. the deers are at the far end of the park from the Train Station.. so factor in the timing needed to walk there...There is also a playground in the park where my son had great fun.. All in, this is a very nice place to relax and see some lovely deers..NOTE 2: there was a van @ the entrance selling Churros made fresh and fried on the spot... if you see the van, buy some and enjoy.. very nice and cheap...."
29,5.0,"It is easy to get caught up in the excitement of Seoul, but Seoul Forest offers a wonderful break in the action and a chance to breath, relax and soak up some natural beauty. This is an extensive park that includes lovely walks, natural surroundings, educational exhibits such as a butterfly garden (particularly fun during a winter visit) and deer park where you can feed the deer. Restrooms and snack bars abound. Easy to get to on the metro, too. For our family, Seoul Forest was a bit of a hidden gem that we found only because the palaces were closed for New Years and we wanted something to do...but you can seek it out as a destination. I know we will the next time we visit Seoul."
