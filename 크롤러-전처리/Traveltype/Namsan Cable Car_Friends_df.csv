0,4.0,This cable car ride ends with a beautiful view of old and new seoul.  It's  a shirt 3 minute ride but the niew from the top is beautiful.
1,4.0,"You probably see a lot reviews saying packed cable car, can't see much etc. Well cause you expecting it at the wrong place!Not there yet.. The aim getting Namsan Cable Car is to reach at the top, Namsan Tower. And it is fine if you can hardly see the view along the way cause the best view is on the top later!  Breathtaking view and have few fav spots for your instagram feed. hehe. Got convenience store, cafe & souvenir shops too upthere. But i suggest you can packed your own sandwich then. save! haha.Tips: Personally I highly suggest you guys to buy one way ticket. Go for a walk when going down from the top. Another forgetful view and hidden insta spots beside the love locks.LOL. thank me later!"
2,4.0,"First time in this place, and we finally get to see all these padlocks that we see in a lot of k-dramas. Perfect cool weather this time of the year!"
3,1.0,"We spent 50 minutes cramped in a line with coughing wheezing sweaty Koreans waiting for a cable car to the Seoul tower. Believe me it's not worth the hassle or stress.No air conditioning and this is only April. God help people when the Sumner arrives. All because of a technical fault, which sums up Korea. Promises so much delivers little.You are then crammed into a small box for the 2 minute trip and are greeted by a long queue that you will have to join to get back down. All this to go up Seoul Tower where you cannot see out off if the Sun is shining as the windows have not been cleaned for years.Complete waste of time and money, which sums up Seoul."
4,2.0,This cable car we must stand up with tons of people... not the same with the BBF movies... lil bit disappointed
5,4.0,"(I say romantic but I went with my friends so that we could go to Namsan Tower. ) We went around 7:00 PM from Myeongdong Station.  We noticed it was very popular with couples.  Going at night is better than day time to see the city lights I think.  It was worth it for us because we had already been shopping for hours in Myeongdong and walking to the cable car station was a very steep 15 minute walk uphill from Myeongdong Station Exit 2 or 3.  When you buy the ticket for the cable car, there is a short line to get inside the cable cars.  Beware the long line for the ride back at night."
6,4.0,"While the line for the cable car can be long & crowded, it is worth the wait for the panoramic views of Namsan. Go during the peak of fall foliage or spring cherry blossoms for the best views! Make sure to check the visibility index before you go."
7,3.0,A short duration ride up to Namsan Park by this cable car is possible. Climbing up by walking is also possible. I guess cable car cost is a bit expensive.
8,5.0,"We went in March so the queues were minimal. The tickets were relatively cheap (return ticket) but do not include entry to the tower (you buy this once you get to the top). The cable car trip lasts for about 2-3 minutes and the views were pretty amazing, you can see for miles! The love locks at the top of the hill by the tower are worth a visit, take your own with you though as they charge a lot if you want to buy one. The tower itself was quite pricey and the view from the LOTTE world tower is much better for a similar price. I can imagine that the walk down from the tower would be great, steep but enjoyable!Worth checking the weather before you head up there as if its windy the cable cars don't operate!"
9,3.0,"Hi guys, i just get back from seoul and since its still fresh in my memory, hopefully i can gives you all the detail of the ride. This cable car connect us to Namsan tower  or you might find other name which is N Seoul tower, you need to come to Namsan oreumi elevator to get inline to get to Namsan cable car. May i inform you during winter you need to get your hotpack / coat and also patience ready since there will be long queues from entrance gate to namsan cable car. I go there at sunday night and my waiting time was 45 min for 5 min ride, while on the way back slightly less ( maybe because its already late). So if you have tight schedule pls consider the timing. So many attraction there at Namsan tower. Aside love lock site for your photo portfolio You can get package for your wishes attraction ( you can see in the ticketing). There was hellokitty island, observer deck, hanbok rental, gift shop n many other shop. Mine was hello kitty island and its cuteness overload although its quite expensive for small spaces (cost around usd 8) but fine with me. And the other i can tell you was the city light n the namsan tower itself, must have list on your photo portfolio."
10,5.0,"My sister and I had a crazy time trying to find this place. It is definitely accessible once you get off Myeongdong exit 4. There is a hotel I think is Pacific Hotel that sits between 2 roads, left and right. We decided to follow the advice of one of the reviews on here and go LEFT at the intersection, HOWEVER we regretted that decision quickly. We went up several steep hills and super steep streets that seemed to go on forever. We had to ask an elderly man for some help and thankfully my sister can speak some hangul so could communicate and he pointed us in the direction. We ended up at the top of the street and because we couldn't see anything that alluded to cable car but could see the tower, we proceeded to walk up 8 sets of stairs. I was frozen and about ready to throw up my dinner. By the time we got up to the stairs we saw the cable car going in the direction we just came from hahaha. We had to walk down and we saw that the cable car was at the top of the street. The ride only lasts a short while like my man, but it was so cool at night! The lights are EPIC. And I got a feel for one of my favourite kdramas Boys over Flowers as this was where Gu Jyn Pyo (LEE MIN HO) shot the scene with Jandi! Yass. Last admission was 10:30pm I think and we made it there around 10:15pm paying around $20AUD for a return trip. DO NOT GO LEFT AT THE INTERSECTION GUYS!!! Unless you want a cardio workout. Go RIGHT! Then go up the set of stairs and you will be right there!"
11,4.0,Good for one time. I visited with a friend on sunday and it was very crowded so we had to wait for quite a long time. The ride was short but it was fun. You can see some parts of Seoul during the ride. Not breathtaking but a nice experience overall.
12,4.0,You have to queue long for this short ride but it's worth it. The view is beautiful at night but I believe it will look even more splendid during the day in spring. Ride up from Myeondeong!!
13,4.0,"Visit N seoul tower which is located at altitude, using Cable car this is one of the right choice. To go to cable car location can use public transportation from myeongdong station or use Namsan Ormi. Avoid coming to visit on weekends, because the queue will be quite long to buy tickets ( but If lucky enough, the queue could be quite short as we got on the weekend time). on weekend, in addition to foreign tourists, many local residents also use this cable car to visit N seoul Tower."
14,5.0,Very crowded although week day and must waiting too long. The best to see seoul at night very beautiful.
15,3.0,"Avoid taking the cable during holidays or weekends, you'll have to queue for hours. You can take the cable car one-way up and hike down , it won't take much time or effort and you'll enjoy the scenery as well."
16,5.0,Very cool! You can see the whole city from up there which is huge. The tower is beautiful as well...
17,3.0,Took cable car to reach the Namsan Tower where you can experience the view that breathtaking. Be patience because the queue can be long but it's worth waiting.
18,4.0,The Namsan cable car is a great way to kill a couple hours while enjoying the great view of Seoul. There are two options to get up to the top. You can pay right $8 one way to ride the sort cable car that takes roughly 5 mins to get to the top. Or you can walk up the stairs for free. The area at the top is huge so there are plenty of places to walk to enjoy a different view of the city.
19,5.0,For the lazy ones like us and does not like the hike up and on time constraint--- try the ride. It cost around 8000won return ticket. Its a little difficult to appreciate the view since a lot of people cramp in a little space.
20,5.0,After the tower you can take the cable car down by the road to pick up a taxi. It's about a 2 min ride and costs 6000 WON per person. Views are good too.
21,4.0,"We got the cable car because it was too hot to walk up the massive hill. It wasn't too busy and cost 6,000KRW per person. The views are really lovely- just make sure you are by the window! We ended up walking down rather than taking the cable car though, beautiful views."
22,3.0,"We tried to go to the N Tower twice. We wanted to see Seoul at night so we got to the cable car 9pm on Saturday - BIG MISTAKE. the queue was so long that we would not make it in time to get back (cable car closes 11pm while the N Tower is open till midnight). We returned Sunday at 7:30pm and the waiting time to buy the ticket was 5 mins (plus another 30 mins to actually get into the wagon). You are squeezed like sardines and very few people can see the view (I was lucky to see it). Round ticket for adult is 8,500₩. You can see a lot of the city from the car itself if you are by the window so not sure if really worth paying additional 10,000₩ for the N Tower admission. It's a close walk the Namsanog Hanok Village and they have some food stands at the top."
23,4.0,Round trip ticket cost 8500won. Waiting time is acceptable if u avoid peak hour (: each cable car come every 5mins.
24,3.0,"They pack people in like sardines, but otherwise, it's a good experience. Best way to get up to the tower, unless you want to walk!!"
25,3.0,Pretty standard cable ride up. It's obviously a short one. I highly recommend taking one way up and walking down. It's a very pleasant 30 minutes walk. I came at around 10:30am and there were not many people. It was easier to get there via taxi.
26,2.0,Went here a couple of days ago and didn't really rate it. We waited 70 minutes just to get on and you are literally on it for just 2 minutes. There are only 2 cable cars. 1 goes up while the other Comes back down so the line moves very very slowly. You can walk up to the top of the hill which would be loads quicker but it is a fairly steep hill
27,3.0,This is a short little ride of less than five minutes. Good for older people and kids.Otherwise you may enjoy a little hike up.The cable cars end at around 11pm and tower doesn't allow to go up after 10:30pm so make sure to time your ride correctly.
28,4.0,"we enjoyed our ride to the N tower using the cable car. Although it is slow and takes time queuing on the ground but each cable car can accommodate around 20 people, and you will enjoy the scenery view."
29,2.0,"Decided to go up to see the sunset, so we were there an hour before the sunset- bad idea. The wait took us 3 HOURS!!! The queue was just not moving at all and we didn't realise at that time that apparently theres also a bus going up?! The ride is decent price but not worth the view, the cable cars are packed of people, so you won't see much- and everything you see, you will have a better view up at the hill anyway.. Maybe we just had bad luck, but oh my god how annoying it was to wait in a crowded humid room with no vacant seats.."
30,3.0,"The cable car starts from Myeongdong and the ride takes 5 mins max.It is often very busy and thus the queues can be long, very long. One way costs the $6 USD, which is twice of what a taxi will cost. The views on the way are ok, but nicer once on the top."
31,2.0,You are paying to stand in a long long line that will lead you by their coffeeshop. Tourist doesn't like to wait so they will push and show no concern about others than themselves. When you finally arrive to the cable cart you won't be able to see anything because they stuff the cart with people like a stuffed thanksgiving turkey. Save your money and walk up
32,4.0,"If you want to go to the N Seoul Tower, try taking the Namsan Cable Car which will take you at he base of the tower. You can opt not to go up the tower. The view of Seoul at the base is already fantastic. Although from the nearest station, you have to walk a bit uphill to get to the 'terminal'. We went there on a weekday night so there are less crowd and no long queues."
33,4.0,its super crowded on the namsan on Saturday night.. its full of couple :)the view is amazing..and its soo romantic :)
34,5.0,"If you're heading up to the Namsan tower, why not take the cable car for a great affordable experience! Awesome views of Seoul!Instead of taking the cab to the tower, grab the cable car instead! It was awesome and i definitely think its worth it!"
35,5.0,"Wonderful city views provided from the Car and once atop Namsan (Mount Mongmyeok) where, if you are with your lover, you can purchase a lock and throw away the key, symbolically locking your hearts to each other there on a fence/lock wall.  Its a lovely idea.  You can also get dressed in traditional Korean clothing and have your photo taken.  If you want to save some money, bring your own lock.  :)"
36,5.0,"Cable car is  highly appreciated indeed, however if you make a one way trekking at least, you would enjoy really much!!! Besides exhausted a little bit :D Next time when I go, I will leave enough time to play with children who are having fun in the water spraying fountains! It was a really amazing refresher after a long climbing!!!"
37,3.0,"I took the cable car up to where the tower was. It was at night and packed. Not worthy. I'd rather take the bus or walk up. If there were lesser people, i guess it its fine."
38,2.0,A very short trip in a packed capsule. The staff were rude. People were racing to get good spot. Its quite expensive but still better than climbing the whole way up on a cold winter night.
39,3.0,It is about 10 minutes ride from the base to the top. Beautiful autumn scene around the area near the tower and the overview of Seoul city at the top of Namsan Hill. They have some shops and food stalls at the Namsan Tower.
