The mountain at the back of residence is a nice and peaceful place to enjoy the view of Korea in early winter. People should really visit here to feel the tension behind the open scene."
1,5.0,This is one of the best museums that introduce Korean culture to foreigners. I would recommend travellers to put this in their first things to do upon arrival in Korea as this will give meaning to all the other experiences afterwards. The kimchi museum gives a lot of insight on the Korean palate while the activity that allows you to have your name translated in Korean is a very interesting and fun event.

It was amazing to learn about the history of presidency of Korea. The office of the president is materialized there and you can pose in front of the table of the president as if you were the president of Korea."
