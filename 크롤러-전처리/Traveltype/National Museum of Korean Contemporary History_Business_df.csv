0,4.0,"There is so much to see and do in Seoul we almost missed it. On our way to the Gyeongbokgung Palace we noticed the museum. It was GREAT. Free admission and open on Monday. On entry, supplied 1 ID for 4 people to get audio guides. Takes at least 2hrs to see it all- unless your battery runs out - then just keep walking and reading. Texts are in Korean and English so no problems. A very interesting museum only problem was with the audio users I guess because my friends and I kept getting the wrong audio with what we were seeing. We kept saying â€œwhat number are you at? Why does it go from 103 to 108. Guess we should have picked up the guide before we started!!!  Has a Cafe and rooftop deck as well"
1,4.0,"This lesser-known museum in Seoul covers South Korea's history from the time of its independence in 1945 to relatively recently. Visitors proceed through several exhibit halls that display artefacts and news articles, with history told through several short explanations at each exhibit. There is also an external display (on the ground floor) that covers street protests and government corruption.The displays have a distinct feel of propaganda from the current government (especially towards the North and previous apparently-corrupt governments) but it gives a good slant on modern Korean history.The museum is open to 9pm on some nights, making it a good destination for ""after work"" visits. Free entrance. Depending upon your level of interest, you can get through it in an hour."
2,4.0,"First of all, this museum is free which I appreciated.  Basically the focus here is late 19th century Korean history to the present--end of the Joson dynasty, Japanese occupation, Korean war and developing a democracy.I learned quite a bit, though at times it felt more like propaganda.  I had a limited amount of time so I had to skip the exhibits about the most recent times."
