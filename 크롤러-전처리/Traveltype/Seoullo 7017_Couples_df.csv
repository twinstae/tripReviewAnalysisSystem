1,4.0,"A bit like the NY highline, this is an urban walkway created from a disused rail line that allows you to walk through the downtown area of Seoul unimpeded by traffic. What a simple but brilliant idea; I hope more cities copy it. There are pleasant features there (like a piano) to break the journey, it's a pleasant stroll you can pick up near Seoul station."
2,5.0,"A quirky elevated garden built on an overpass above the busy Seoul streets. They provide free umbrellas to borrow whilst enjoying the walk and protect yourself from the sun. There are plenty of different varieties of plants, a nice area where mist is sprayed to keep cool (plants and tourists alike) and was overall a nice place to visit without crowds to bother you."
3,5.0,"It is probably the most beautiful walk to take in the night. The old Seoul Railway station is in lit up and so is the new one, not to mention the sky walkway. It is such a wonderful place to wander. Simply go!"
4,3.0,"all the plants are either leafless or covered because it still seems like winter here even though it's already end of March. but i did not regret coming here, we really can see the great effort to revitalise the city with fresh looks while letting visitors to experience the bustling city without to worry about the traffic."
5,4.0,"This wide, elevated walkway -- about 56-feet-high -- runs for 1 kilometer between Malli-dong and Namdaemun Market. The pedestrian green space opened in 2017, replacing a highway overpass that originated in 1970. I've strolled along the two similar walkways that exist worldwide, the High Line in New York City and the Promenade Plantee in Paris, and was curious about how this one would compare. So on a recent visit to Seoul, I picked up a brochure about the attraction at the Information office, about where Seoullo 7017 begins by the market's Gate 5. Here, the walkway is like a ramp, slowly rising to the full height.  Along the stretch, I also noted five elevators and one escalator.I liked the opportunity to amble with few pedestrians to dodge, looking at buildings and vehicular traffic from a different perspective than what occurs at ground level. Cafes and at least one place to buy snacks beckoned on this early Sunday morning, and myriad plants thrived in a variety of pots along with young trees. The brochure offered an introduction to the greenery that can be seen here, but the growth still has a way to go to compete with New York City and Paris. There is also much more concrete here and the distance is shorter than the other two.It took about 15 minutes to walk to an elevator that descends to Seoul Station Square. But it does not lead directly into the station.Seoullo 7017 appealed to me for a one-time visit. But it did not entice me to return, which happened with the High Line and Promenade Plantee."
6,4.0,"Great innovation and urban revitalisation. Use it to walk quickly from Seoul Station to Namdaemun. Along the way, lots for the eye to see, including those cute tortoises that tricked me into thinking they were statues. Really quirky and one of those reasons, Seoul just keeps on giving as a growing exciting destination."
7,4.0,"We decided to visit this park around sunset: various plantings and street pianos are scattered about, plus some tiny coffee shops and some stores. It’s about .5-6 mile ?, inspired by what NYC did in the Highline Park, which we happened to see 4 months ago."
8,4.0,"Recently opened and featuring all manner of interactive elements in addition to great views of this ever-changing city, Seoullo 7017 is an easy journey on-foot through green spaces that have been built on an old freeway ramp. Leading the visitor from nearby the Namdaemun Market to Seoul Station (or vice-versa), the best time to visit is dusk as the park is lit-up by coloured LEDs, entire building sides are illuminated by animated video displays and the city is bathed in a golden light as the sun sets. Seoul Station offers a small number of eateries as well as discount shopping, but anticipate some homeless people waiting out the day in its shadow."
9,3.0,"Good idea, kinda ok execution, the plants are pretty, but it's way too short and the f&b facilities are overpriced. Just go eat at Namdaemun market if you go there!"
