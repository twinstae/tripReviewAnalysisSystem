0,3.0,The building and the surrounding are interesting enough to give the museum a try even if the collection/ installations are of unequal interest.
1,5.0,I came here since I was curious to see what is on show. The museum is big and after a while you figure out how to navigate it. Most galleries were open and the exhibitions held there very interesting. Especially the one about Park Seobo! Ticket for anyone above 24 and not yet 65+ is 4000â‚©
2,4.0,this museum is great i went when it was raining and directly at the entrance they had bags for wet umbrellas and free lockers which was great! the exhibits were all very interesting and i got an English listening guide as i was walking around. defiitely worth braving the rain for.
3,4.0,"Only an audiovisual presentation was available when I visited at basement level.I can not speak Korean but I watched it twice. It was a three concurrent large screen presentation. Famous as a preeminent academic, Professor Joan Kee, Professor of Art at the University of Michigan points out the development of art and its respective time frame. Post war in Korea means post Korean War in 1953. With that in mind, this video looks at the transition from the Japanese occupation through the period of separation to the destruction of the Korean War. It perhaps shares some similarities with the search for identity in Eastern Europe when the wall came down. It describes isolation and separatism. It captures suffering, hardship of war, and the suffering of individuals, innocent civilians whose lives were torn apart by the separation. Just as you may be getting comfortable there is the sound of gunfire. It paints a picture of the shortcomings of war and its destructive elements. Interesting films - and then you go to leave the auditorium and discover this is not fictional because all the clothes of one of the portrayees is on display. How vividly that brings the life of that person to a real witness. More poignant of the hardships she must have endured and suffered. Excellent presentation. Full marks.Whilst your at the museum check out the restaurant - stunning and inexpensive."
4,4.0,The museum is located near the G palace.It provides 9 exhibition spaces for contemporary art mostly a Korean one. Ch city what is being exhibit but in any case once you are in the area worth a visit.
5,4.0,This museum has interesting collections. Location is easily accessible. In each hall it is possible to find English speaking gentle staff. Also it is possible to find printed information on exhibitions.
6,5.0,"Count in spending several hours here to see the huge display if contemporary art, mainly Asian. It is a world class museum. The only drag for non Koreans is that the audio guide has a bit of info on just a few works, and there is minimal English signage otherwise. Still, if you have any interest in contemporary art make sure you come here. Conveniently, the very good Arario Museum in Space, also focused on contemporary art though with a more western orientation and better English signage, is just up the road."
7,5.0,Visited on a short trip to Seoul and would come back there.It's a great venue with very cool exhibitions happening.
8,4.0,quiet and impressive museum with lots oxf Asian artists. Great to walk around for 2 hrs and get some modern inspiration.
9,3.0,"Only went in as it was free over the CNY holiday. I just don't understand why an empty room is art. Or a room full of clay balls. There are a few pieces that are interesting to look at but for the most of it, if your 5 year old produced it you would be happy, but you would not make a room full of it and call it art."
10,5.0,"You never know what to expect with a contemporary art museum. It seems like each one I visit around the world exhibits something completely different from each other one. It's the uniqueness of a museum that makes it stand out from the predictable.There's only two floors to this museum, and it only took an hour to see it all, but I found it to be quite addictive. Rather than spoil it, I'd recommend people just check it out for themselves.The pieces that stood out for me were photos that artists took by examining children's drawings made with crayons and turning them into real-life photographed copies down to each tiny detail to reflect the original drawing, not to mention the fact it was so bizarre and adorable it made me laugh in amazement. I'd never seen anything like it in my life."
11,4.0,"This museum was open last year. It is near insadong and samchungdong. If you are interested in modernart, go MMCA. Near MMCA you can see many galleries, so after you see mmca, go sime galleries. Usually it is open until 6. The last entry time is 5 maybe.more information go hompage."
12,3.0,"The museum building is spacious and fancy, located just outside Gyeongbokgung palace and the folk museum. However, at the time of my visit, only one or two (!) of the eight exhibition galleries were open, so not that much to look at really. Make sure to check in advance before you visit, since it not cleary stated on their website front page which exhibitions that are open. Closed on Mondays and entrance fee for adults is 4000 won."
13,4.0,Really enjoyed the internal as well as external art on show here. The varied collection of contemporary pieces were world class.
14,5.0,"A complex for modern art with a recreated palace within the grounds. It has a good library and at present , an outdoor intallation art to marvel at."
