0,1.0,"I found the shop on the 6th floor of DOOTA Mall (Dongdaemun) called Arirang very rude. They sell all sorts including the 777 nail clippers which I went for. The shopkeepers were not interested in me being present. I got the impression I got in the way. However, 10 minutes later, a group of people from a tour company turned up. The shopkeepers were very interested in them coming in all of the sudden. Also, I asked a guy at the cashier a question 3 times and he ignored me on all occasions. However he was more than happy to talk to other people. That was disgusting!"
1,3.0,I won't buy anything in Doota- it has grown into a landmark but everything in Dongdaemun is more expensive than elsewhere. It is just a building with endless shops and overly priced clothes.....I rather prefer other places than here. Walked through since I was there- just to have a look. Good to visit at night.
2,4.0,My wife would have loved it. More for ladies. Other than the operating hours shopkeepers here can understand English...;)
3,4.0,"if you need various korean souvenir in one place you could try the arirang shop in doota(5th floor). the price is affordable, relatively lower than the price at namdaemun or myeoung dong market. very recommended, except if you are hard bargainer and really like the challenge to bargain in the market (maybe only 10% lower)"

It sells traditional snacks, tshirts, keychain and lots of others to bring as souvenirs.They can speak english and Bahasa indonesia.It turns out that it was cheaper than the store i went that nearby the incheon airport.I bought a 7.000won in doota and it was 11.000 in the store nearby airport. Not bad.The cloth in doota mall was good."
