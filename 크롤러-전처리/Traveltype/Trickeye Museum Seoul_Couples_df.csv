0,5.0,Small place but worth the little money you spend. First time I have been to a place like this and my wife and I had a good time. Not to crowded and it conveniently located in the same building as the Love Museum and Ice Museum. Also has several things to do close by so makes for a great day trip.
1,2.0,"The trickeye portion is ok but I expected all pictures to have AR effects, not just 4. The VR portion was very bad. The only ride that was working for 2 people was a roller coaster. There are so many boring VR rollercoasters and this is one of them. All other rides were broken including a ride with 2 chairs but they told me only one was working."
2,3.0,"Considering this place is top rated amongst tourist. I feel that there needs to be some kind of guidance. There was a language barrier and no one could assist us on how things worked. Also the space is very limited. Too many people going in at once, no room to take pictures and the locals had no sense of awareness of other people taking photos. Nonetheless once we got some infoFrom another tourist and the place cleared up. It was good experience.**tip- maybe have some control the flow of people coming in and give some kind of time limit. Also for couples- we wanted to pics together but non of the staff could help us out. Maybe have staff members walking around offering to take your picture."
3,5.0,"We had a great time, lots to see and very well laid out, we are an adult couple and highly enjoyed ourselves, it is also a very reasonable price and includes admission to the ice museum."
4,5.0,"I visited Trick Eyes Museum and loved it so much! It is really good program with your friends too. I went there with my husband and he really loves the Love Museum hehe ðŸ¥°We took more than 100 pictures there. I recommend to wear a nice, but comfortable dress :)! It is crazy hot in Seoul nowadays so the Trick Eyes Museum is really good indoor program.I recommend for family too, I am sure children loves colorful pictures and the atmosphere!"
5,5.0,It's a cool place in Hongdae to have fun with family! It's good to download the Trickeye carema apps to get 3D effect for the picture!
6,5.0,This is a great day out. You will need to download the trickeye app to take full advantage of the various optical illusions they have here.
7,4.0,"The museum is one of the 36 places of interest with free entry with the purchase of the Seoul Tourist Card. We took the Green line on the Metro arriving at Hongik Station. About a five minute walk should have got us there, but the street signs and the building blocks confused my Google Map and it was a little bit hard to find the single entrance with no real shop front of this basement museum.To activate the AR program, the museum provides free WiFi to download the AR App.It became quite fun and exciting (us being first timer with AR) to watch the action coming from the static paintings. We took lots of videos and photos. With limited time at each painting, and lots of tourist and families moving through the art as well, it was impossible to get the timing right to fight with dragons, surf with two sharks, etc.Still, we enjoyed the visit.The ice museum was cold, really cold, with quite a few ice sculptures, but not as exciting as the AR side."
8,5.0,"Cost is 15,000/person and covers only TrickEye and ice museum. The whole thing lasted about ~2 hours. There are a ton of different pictures with cool effects in the background using the TrickEye app. Some of them are cool, some of them are bland. Itâ€™s very creative an different. Be prepared to take lots of pictures and casual waits here and there. Most of the people there are quite oblivious and will lack the common courtesy of letting you take a picture (they just walk in front of the camera). The ice museum and small and quick. Quick because itâ€™s very cold, -6 C. There is a cool slide in there as well as intricate decor made of ice."
9,1.0,"Bit of a con. Nothing special, actually pretty weak. You have to do the experience using an app which annoyingly runs off your smart phone so drains the battery and definately not suitable for kids. The only interesting part is the VR arcade and they charge extra for that. Avoid!"
10,4.0,"We really didn't know what we were getting into when we decided to visit the Trickeye Museum and we came on the recommendation of a friend who visited with their two kids earlier this year.Be sure your smartphone is charged as your whole experience and the memories you take with you will be captured on your smartphone. A traditional camera is useless here.When you get arrive, there is wi-fi available for you to download their app which is needed to create the special effects in the pictures and videos you take with your phone. Lots of neat optical illusions and you can get creative with your poses. And bring along a sense of humour."
11,5.0,Me and my wife went to the trick eye museum and ice museum. There is an AR to download for free. With the AR app things looks much more realistic and I highly recommend you to check this museum out if you are in Hongdae!
12,5.0,"Visitors can enjoy taking tricky pictures/videos using a mobile application, the photos seem so real. So funny place"
13,3.0,"Its just awful. Do i regret going? im not sure, Its so bizarre. I was embarrassed in there and left with in 5 mins. The photos... well i won't be showing them on our holiday pic slide show. Was it worth it? It was different, fairly cheap hilarious to watch others and just a bit disturbing."
14,5.0,"This experience is so much fun. My husband and I visited this place. We will be visiting again and this time, with the kids. They will surely enjoy this. Get ready with your acting skills."
15,4.0,Nice experience. We had a lovely day at this wierd museum. We took a lot of great photos we can post on social media
16,5.0,"The museum is very funny. You gotta download the app to properly enjoy the animations. If you are in a group, would vÃª better to take group pictures. It has a Nice mirror room at the end!"
17,5.0,"Had a really great time with my wife, lots of pictures to take and the AR portion is pretty cool. Should try atleast once."
18,4.0,"This place was a very unique and cool experience. My only wish is that it would be a longer expierence, but it definitely is something to not miss."
19,5.0,"I will advise my  friends go to visit  this place  at least one time you can see many things which will in your life, observe and enjoy a lot which is memorable and you can enjoy a lot."
20,4.0,"The illusional art paintings are pretty nice! The app which makes the art animated is also neat, but if you try taking photos, itâ€™s a bit blurry (doesnâ€™t focus). The only recommendation Iâ€™d make is at least have one or two staff around so they can help take photos for you? Cause itâ€™s nice and neat, but would be neater if you can actually be in the photo, but itâ€™s difficult if thereâ€™s nobody to take photos for you!"
21,4.0,"It was somewhat busy when I came here, but the rooms are big with a few different paintings per room. I opted not to download the app, just to focus on pictures, I think you'll have a great time with or without the app. Make sure to come here with friends, the whole point is to have a good time and get creative with photos. The wide range of paintings was fabulous, they ranged from everything to scary and funny to gross and weird. If you have time while on vacation and looking for something creative, give the Trickeye Museum a try!"
22,4.0,"A good place to chill out. They will recommend you to download their trickeye app, and please do so. The app make all the portraits come to live, but the only downside is the app doesn't support wide angle and the picture quality is not as good if you use your own phone camera. Sometimes we use both alternatively, which cause the app to lagged and not responsive. Overall good experience."
23,4.0,"Get caught by two sharks, breathed on by dragons, filmed alongside Hollywood stars and look into your phone by dowloading the trick eye app and watch the pictures being brought to 3 D life. Combine with a shopping exercise around the famous streets of Hongdae. Cant find it - ask the Seoul volunteers close to the train station to give you some guidance. Fun place. There is also an Ice place and a bit of a kinky Love 3D version - all in the same place."
24,5.0,"I went to AR museum with my friend,we took many interesting photo using illusion period, the effect of AR make the picture much more lifely, it was a very unique and fun experience."
25,4.0,Very fun 3D museum that uses their mobile app for augmented reality in your pictures. App was so-so but fun none the less. Love museum (R18) is above this.The place is worth checking out if you havent been to a 3D museum. You need someone to take your picture so going solo is not recommended. The more the merrier.Its quite tiring to get the right shots so do not rush through them.Also some murals may contain some mature content so please do not bring small kids.
26,4.0,Free admission with Discover Seoul Pass (24/48/72 hours) value cardDownload the Trickeye Museum APP and enjoy your photo shots!
27,5.0,It was really cool to be able to take fun pictures in the trick eye museum. The pictures come out some cute and itâ€™s a really great date idea or going there with family!
28,5.0,It's so funny to go with friends.Use your imagenation and you can poste as intersting as you do. Enjoy it!
29,5.0,"If you wanna record yourself fighting sea monsters from Jason's quest for the golden fleece, poisonous snakes hanging from the ceiling or dinos from Jurassic Park, this is the right place to go. The app is easy to download and use, and the results are astounding!"
30,5.0,a must place to visit in Seoul! highly recommend download the TrickEye app and it will totally blow your mind how vivid the 3D effect is!!! I enjoyed it a lot and the pictures will surely become very popular in your Instagram!
31,5.0,"It was superb, have been there 2 years ago and still lots fun during my recent visit. The renovated facilities with AR techniques impressed me:) definitely will visit again!"
32,5.0,"A nice a fun place to go for a date, you will laugh a lot for sure ! The VR experience is also really nice and even though you can think that itâ€™s a enjoyable place for kids, but believe me some adults had more fun than some kids while posing with the interactives brackgrounds ! Go with a fully charged phone and enjoy some fun time with your family, lover or Friends !"
33,5.0,Honestly one of the highlights of the trip. It is just pure unadulterated bizarre fun. AND your ticket includes an ice museum which I wonâ€™t say anything about because it will spoil the shock when you enter...
34,4.0,This place is definitely worth a visit. The trick art shows a lot of talent. There are several cleverly done pieces. Make sure you have your camera or your phone. Should only take you a few hours to leisurely go through the museum. Itâ€™s perfect for a rainy day.
35,5.0,Fun thing to do. We found it through TripAdvisor and paid a visit. Good place for optical illusion photos. Perfect if it rains.
36,5.0,"We went there one and a half hour before closing time and there were no people - we had so much fun and took millions of pictures. Although it might sound a bit stupid, I am sure everyone will enjoy it :)"
37,5.0,"Together with the ticket to TrickEye Museum you will get an Ice Musen ticket included, which is located in the same area. Additionally, this ticket will give you a discount in case you want to visit love museum, which is located one floor higher. In trick eye Museums you can download an app that animates images/videos, quite cool :) it is also quite big, we have taken tones of funny pictures!"
38,4.0,"You need to download the apps on to your phone to get the full 3-D effects to take pictures at the various stations.The area around this museum is very lively full of young people and interesting cafes, restaurants and shops."
39,5.0,"grab their app, and run your batteries out with how many pictures and videos you will take!!! oh and bring a coat for the ice museum"
40,4.0,"Subjected to a heavy rain day, we decided to try the museum - for two adults we had a remarkably good time!  We were fortunate that it was not very busy, but having other people there would likely provide additional amusement."
41,5.0,The place is amazing. There are lot of cool stuffs to see in there. I visited the Ice museum which was really cool. All the things inside was made of ice. It's really a cool place. Couples are highly recommended to go. I had lot of fun with my friends. Amazing experience.
42,5.0,"I went to Trick Eye Museum with my boyfriend last weekend and we had SO much fun! We started by experiencing the new 3D option available through an app to enjoy even more the trick-eye paintings and it was super realistic and beyond our expectations! Then we visited the Ice Museum which was super interesting (we loved the iced slide!) even if ""of course"" really cold. Then we ended the visit by the Love Museum and that was just a whole bunch of laughter !!! The trick-eye paintings are just amazing and we really loved this part even more. I would say the ice museum and trick eye museum can be visited with family members or boyfriend/girlfriend and of course, the love museum is a great ""couple activity"" :)"
43,4.0,"Trickeye museum has interesting pictures and animation combined, but needs a phone or tablet with a camera and bigger screen, and you need to download and use their app to see the animations. From the same floor you can also go to Ice museum or try out some VR stuff like shoot some zombies etc. Above this museum is also the Love museum. The ideas in the rooms were great, but the rooms itself were a bit small for most of them, so it was impossible to grasp them fully."
44,5.0,"The day in the trick eye museum was wonderful. We went on a weekday around 10, so the museum was not busy at all which was perfect to take pictures. We had so much fun taking funny pictures. A day not to forget."
45,5.0,"Even if you're not at the ""Love Museum"" level yet, this is a great place to come with a significant other. Ideally, come on a double date, so you can take pictures of each other together in the many interesting displays. Make sure to charge your phone first! ^_^"
46,5.0,"Recommendations: Recharge your phone power before visiting. I did the mistake of taking my phone without battery and I regret. The place is funny, curious and interesting! I'm very sure you may take at least 20-30 pictures all around the facilities~~ the designs are cool, the time is nice, and the experience is simply funny. I definitely will go back with a better camera ðŸ˜…"
47,1.0,"Totally overhyped. Boring as can be after the novelty of the first few exhibits wears off. Need the app to see most of the ""tricks"" which are basically just CGI overlays. App will drain ur battery too. Was looking forward to actual trompe l'oiel art, which can be very creative, but this museum had only pokemon-go type facile tricks. Absolutely disappointing."
48,5.0,"So apparently the Trickeye Museum is  a whole AR paradise. You got the trickeye app that brings everything to life AND the themes change everyone. Then there is the ice museum, love museum and trick adventure?? Well I loved every single minute of it."
49,3.0,It can get very busy and you do not have the time to take photographs very people are very pusy and take their time which causes problems very disappointed
50,5.0,"We spent hours here perfecting our acting skills and photography. I recommend trying to go there not on a public holiday or a weekend. Lots of people. Many pictures you need one or two takes to get it right. Itâ€™s actually best to go with al least 3 people as many of the trickeye you need 2 people in the picture and one person to take the picture. Make sure you bring your mobile as you have to download an app and use that to take picture to bring your picture alive.We got a little lost walking from station to the place. Directions arenâ€™t that good but there ar signs as you get closer to the place.If you go to the ice museum which is next door, bring a jacket and gloves. Itâ€™s freezing in there. I lasted 10 mins and I was out of there.Love museum is another exhibit upstairs. Extra admission fee."
51,5.0,"We had a few hours to kill before heading to the Olympics and I found the cool museum in the Hongik College area. The pictures online intrigued us so we thought we would take a shot. For 15,000 won, you could visit the Ice and TrickEye museums...both worth it in their own ways. The Ice museum was freezing, no pun intended. I think the sign said -15C and with a jacket and gloves I was only able to hand in there for 15 minutes. The had chairs, igloos, trains, an ice slide, living room, even a toilet. Most were interactive in some way (sitting, standing, sliding). But like I said, my hands were going numb and we had to get out. The trickeye was a combination of ground/wall at that looked like you were standing on walls, bridges, sharks for instance as well as interactive statues. The cool part was the trickeye app that made you pictures come alive with exploding volcanoes, swimming sharks, pouring water. It was a bit crowded on a Sunday but well worth it."
52,4.0,"A museum of optical illusion. It as fun, but at times too crowded (trying to take pictures while people walk in front). I would recommend if you are looking for something unique, to spend an hour.  Going once is enough."
53,4.0,"Out of all the attractions in South Korea, this was the one place I was super keen to visit. I thoroughly enjoyed all the illusions and it made for super fun imagery!! Looking through others photos, there were lots of displays there that isn't there anymore, I wish they could extend the museum and make it longer as it was too short walking through. Their AR options are so much fun too. Lockers are available too which was great as I wasnt keen on carrying heavy jackets into the museum.The APP made it COOLER! Definitely download it as its free, as others have said definitely make sure you have a full battery. It brings the illusions alive.The ice sculpture museum was a nice addition. I enjoyed the ice slide!!!!Great place and I would so visit again!"
54,4.0,"This was a pretty neat experience.  There is the Trickeye and the Ice Museum included in the ticket price of 15,000KRW approx. $15 USD.  The Trickeye museum has several different themed rooms.  You can download the app and have ""special effects"" in your photos.  Some of the lighting and spacing was not adequate for good quality photos.  The ice museum was just that ; Ice sculptures and an ice slide!  They have lockers available for you to lock up your belongings before going in for 500KRW.  Overall it was a fun and silly time!"
55,5.0,"The trickeye museum was really a funny experience and people from all age seem to enjoy it. The price is around 15,000 W / person and there are a series of stops within a space to pose and make pictures. As soon as it gets a bit crowded it gets hard to make the pictures from the desired effect angle, or you have to wait a bit until the next spot is free. So I went there around lunch time (12) and that was perfect, only few people were there. However we saw larger groups upon entering and exiting the museum."
56,4.0,"As with most things in Seoul, this place was a little more crowded than we would have liked. It is especially apparent because of the small space in which the museum is located. All that said, we had a blast and if you download the app, the pictures have a whole new life to them!"
57,4.0,"This is a unique museum. You will use an app to create a 3-D images. I can say that this museum is perfect for teens and young adults. if you have time to spare, see it."
58,4.0,loved this place! so much fun to take photos and some of them look crazy real in photos when you look at them later. It really is a tricky eye haha.
59,5.0,"I vistied trick eye with my boyfriend during the summer and It was one of the memorable experience that my boyfriend and I talk about all the time. Since it was a really hot and humid summer in Korea, we both wanted to escape from the heat. This Trickeye museum was a great escape. All the pictures that we have taken are super fun and Instagram worthy :)) The Ice museum next to the trckeye museum is also super fun!"
60,4.0,Great way to spend an afternoon! Download an app onto your phone and watch the AR come to life when you look at the paintings on the wall and floors.Very well done and clever AR.
61,2.0,It is not fair to call this a museum.  It is just a playground for kids and no tourist attraction at all in my mind unless for people with kids up to about 10 y.o.  Can not recommend it for the regular tourist.  Do something else.
62,4.0,Trickeye museum is a good place to visit for both couples or friends. There is alot of different themes to take pictures off.You can walk through the museum in about 1 to 1.5 hour if you want to take alot of pictures.Entrance fee is 15 000 won for adults if you download their free app.Otherwise it is 18 000 won.We would recommend to go to this museum if you have some sparetime.
63,5.0,"If you take yourself too seriously you may not appreciate how amazing this museum is, but maybe if you do take yourself too seriously you should come here and it'll help you loosen up! It's such a one-of-a-kind experience, but you do need a smart phone to properly utilize the augmented reality experience. 10/10"
64,3.0,"It wasn't as exciting as I had anticipated. It was a fairly high price for a bunch of rooms that people were crowded in. We used the app to make ""3D"" pictures and it wasn't until we left that I realized not a single one saved. This place isn't really a museum so much as just a place to take pictures in a giant room. The Alive museum was much more interactive!"
65,4.0,"We went to Trickeye, Love museum and Alive Museums in Seoul. Trickeye is the best one among the three museums of similar nature, as it is more well-maintained and advanced.  We had been to different Trickeye in other countries so we were not expecting much until we tried out their app! We were really surprised by the great effects created by the app and enjoyed a fun afternoon there.  Tips: Downloading their app is a must!"
66,1.0,Went to the trickeye at Seoul Mapo-gu on 7-5-2017 at 7.57pm approx. What was supposed to be a pleasent event turned into a nightmare!  Went at night and they wanted to check my ticket and took my phone. Then distracted us and my phone was stolen. The lady at the counter pretended she did not speak any english as i asked where my phone went. It was taken and never returned theft!!. She played dumb and she clearly spoke english to a european lady. They sent me running through the ice museum three times where it was so slippery nearly slipped. Also i whacked my head hard on the ice overhead on the level up onto the overhang no clear safety signage at all. Another staff later on found the phone apparently and decided to hand it back. Then it was not even closing time and they were shutting lights at around at 8.30pm of displays. Then they proceeded to lock us in the museum and the staff left. We were stuck in there not even told how to get out in the dark!!! NO APOLOGIES!!!!!RUDE!!!! CRIMINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
67,1.0,"Upon entry to Trickeye Museum, we showed the girl at the front counter our online ticket, she didn't return the phone to us. Only less than 5 minutes later we realized the phone wasn't on us and asked the girl for it. She pretended she didn't understand although she spoke English very well when we first arrived. We frantically looked in our bags and around the place for about 10 minutes. Another staff then came to us with the phone they found on THEIR SIDE OF THE COUNTER! There was no explanation or apologies. The girl who took the phone avoided looking at us and did not say a word.At the end of going through the ""museum"", we came out and all the staff had left and locked the front door. They did not bother to inform us how to exit but just left us in there. We had to find our way to the back door of the building locked in for close to 10 minutes until we escaped!. Obviously trying to avoid speaking to us after what they did. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. DO NOT GET TRICKED INTO GOING THERE AND GETTING YOUR BELONGINGS STOLEN!"
68,4.0,This museum was sooo much fun for my husband and I. We had a lot of fun taking pictures of each other and exploring this place. I have two tips. Don't follow the directions on the website. They are not well written and you will get lost. We did. While the directions are accurate they are vague. Its difficult to find because its tucked away inside a building with no obvious signage from the street. The museum is inside on a lower level. Ask for directions or just walk around shopping until you stumble upon it. Thats how we got there otherwise Id write some clearer directions. Look for a giant brick building is about the best tip I can give. This is the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise this place deserves 5 stars. Definitely worth the price of the ticket. My second tip is do not bring a DSLR or nice camera if you have one. Its a waste of space in a bag or backpack. To get the full effect from this museum you have to download the trickeye app on your phone for the photos/videos to appear to come to life/3D.
69,5.0,We had a great time here.. Me and my wife spent an hour here after roaming around the hongik university area . The new AR app is amazing for pictures and some cool videos. We got 30 percent discount after downloading the app. Overall one of the most fun museum we had been to.
70,5.0,Plan to stay here for an hour or more because they have some pretty cool stuff here! The paintings are so realistic and you'll have so much fun if youre with good friends and good company!
71,4.0,"This place is just plain ridiculous, it definitely is not a museum.  With that being said, we went with a group, and we all had fun taking photos. So if you're looking for something different to do, give it a try."
72,3.0,"It was a cold day, I had read about this place, so thought we would take a look. It was 12000krw to get in, so not expensive. Some of the exhibits were cool, some were a bit lame. Some required some flexibility to get into the right spot for the photoWe had a laugh, and it was a cold day so we weren't upset to be inside for an hour or so.They have storage lockers for 1000won per locker, but it's a ""once open"" deal. You store everything you can, put 1000won in and it locks. You can't go back and grab anything without paying an extra 1000. (It's about $1 Aussie, but just a heads up to save every dollar possible)."
73,4.0,"Funny place to visit. Good place to take photos. But not to go on public holidays as too many people, not only tourists but local people as well"
74,3.0,"We turned up just as a large tour group also arrived. It made it difficult to fully explore all the exhibits as there were long lines for each one. I think if you were to go when it was quieter it would be much more enjoyable. The ice museum (also included in ticket price) had an ice slide, which was fun (would be great for children). The VR rides were an extra expense."
75,5.0,"Overall a simple museum, but we got some funny pictures we shared with friends and family.  The staff was very helpful, there are tricks to lighting and because we were a single couple, it was great that she was able to take pictures for us and show us how to light our faces with our cell phones.A bit difficult to find since it's on the 7th floor of the Sunshine building."
76,5.0,"My fiancÃ© and I went here on a rainy day and it was perfect to spend about 2 hours in taking silly pictures, as well as experiencing the ice room and a face latte..."
77,4.0,"Some of the paintings are showing some wear but they are well done and fun to play along with. This ""museum"" was somewhat crowded but people tended to wait there turn. We got a bunch of silly pictures and had a good time."
78,4.0,Trickeye Museum is best for taking awesome 3D pictures.Just outside are korean restaurants where you can dine after taking a lot of souvenir pictures.
79,4.0,"We had a great time here with all the different places you can take photos on. It wasn't too busy, we were able to get a photo on all the pieces without waiting too long"
80,3.0,"This museum has some fun illusions to take funny pictures, but it definitely didn't seem worthy of the high ratings it has on here. I also found the price (15,000 won) a bit much considering how much in Seoul is both more worthwhile and cheaper. It wasn't bad, but I would have rather kept my money."
81,5.0,First time I came a cross something like that.  Really fun. Can take fun photos and burn some time with fun.  Recommended.
82,2.0,A pretty lame collection of tired back drops for visitors to take cheesy photos that create optical illusions. Bit of fun for the kids but overall not worth the effort in a city with so much more to offer.
83,4.0,Lighten up people. This one is all about having fun. Westerners often have a hard time being silly; this is the cure- IF you can let yourself get into it. Are you too old for it? Is one ever too old to laugh? Heck no! So go!
84,3.0,It is not a museum...it is a gallery of interactive art. Sculptures and paintings you can take pictures with. It creates 3D type environment and the photos taken make it look like you are part of the art itself...really funny outcome.
85,4.0,I was a bit skeptical to go but my girlfriend wanted to see it. And I have to admit we had a fun afternoon there. I'd recommend to go there with more people so posing together and taking pics in turns is even more fun
86,4.0,"We managed to locate the place from street signs and asking at the tourist information.  Buying the tickets was quick and easy and we were able to put our back pack in the locker for 500Won. The place is a bit of fun and allows you to do silly poses in front of the paintings.  There are pictures available to guide you on where to stand for the pose.  It is very clever and looking back at the photos taken is funny.   It wasn't too busy when we went so didn't have to wait for most of the photos.   We went as a couple which was ideal for taking the photos.  However we would have to ask other people to take photo for us for certain pictures. The entrance fee allows you access into the carnival section although you have to pay for certain games.   Also the ice room which we didn't want to go into as we were in shorts and tshirts, and we didn't want the camera to fog up.   All in all a fun trip to while away an hour or so.   There are discounts available if you come across them."
87,5.0,"Funny museum, not that crowded when we were there. The ice part of the museum was well made, but  freezing cold!"
88,5.0,"Awesome Place to visit, my wife and I really enjoyed everything.  It was fun and entertaining. Just an awesome time."
89,4.0,"The Trickeye Museum is located in Hongikro 3gil, Mapogu, and it was fun. It would have been more fun if it weren't for the other inconsiderate tourists. But all-in-all, it was a fun experience. The Ice Musuem area (was it called that?) was really cold. The most we stayed in there was just like 2 minutes and we were out. The love museum was also fun, but of course, only for adults. Also, it would be best to have your DSLRs or phones with good cameras to have great pictures with the illusions."
90,5.0,I found this museum is very interesting and awesome.  We took lots of fantastic 3D photos with numerous posting.  We really have great time here.  Strongly recommend those families with kids to visit this   lovely museum.
91,5.0,"We had a great time posing for photos with all of the different things. Fun for both me and my boyfriend. There's photographs displayed around to show you how to get the most out of each shot. It's not just for kids either, there are many things there to entertain everyone.The ice museum is great, there's an igloo and an ice slide you can go on. Plus there's all kinds of sculptures to photograph with. But it is VERY cold, especially during summer because it's so warm outside and you're not used to it. So make sure to wear warm clothes (long pants) and a jumper because otherwise you won't be able to stay in there for very long and there's no re-entry. Also our camera lens fogged up because it was so cold and it was difficult to take good photos.There's a carnival there too which has games and other stuff you can pay extra for.  There's a tiny mini golf and a Xbox Kinect sports screen. There's even a ball pit for the young kids (or young at heart).We went at around 10am on a Monday in August 2016 and we had the entire place to ourselves. When we left at around 11.30, several large groups of people arrived and it started to get quite busy. So I'd advise trying to go between 9-11.30am. Then you can go for brunch at some of the nice places nearby."
92,3.0,its small you can finish it under 30 mins but its entertaining.  make sure to check out on your hotel if they have a coupon. they usually have a coupon for tourist. we found out just after going back to the hotel since one of the staff from trickeye asked.
93,3.0,"Although, it was fun to walk around the museum was crowded with people crazy for pictures! Its open until 9pm so it might be a better idea to go later in the evening!"
94,4.0,"The entrance fee is KRW15,000 and includes the ice museum but you can get it for KRW12,000 if you download or print-screen a discount voucher (easy to google). We spent an hour taking photos and having a laugh but it was reasonably quiet while we were there, which made it enjoyable. The rooms are small-ish so it can get quite crowded. On our way out, a massive coach party got in - it would have been a very different experience with 50-odd people queueing up to take a photo!"
95,4.0,"Never been to anything like this before so went to check it out. Not that easy to find so swat up on location first, also pick up the 2016 Seoul Summer Sale map pack at the airport which gives you a 20% discount voucher (bringing the price down from $15 to $12pp). Basically you just go round taking photos of yourself (or other half) in some cool eye trick situations. Great concept and so much fun. However you need an extra person to be your photographer, or bring a tripod which is a little awkward. And since I didn't know what the museum was about I wasn't the best dressed so reluctant to take too many photos of me."
96,5.0,"Got to know about Trickeye Museum while we were in Seoul and took time out to visit on the last day. Definitely worth it! Its a quirky, fun experience that made for some great holiday photos."
97,5.0,"Great place to enjoy with your friends and loved ones. We took many pics and had great fun. there was 3 parts :trick eye,Ice area, carnival. firstly the ice are was -4 c and was really cold but we enjoyed it.The trick eye is a must see attraction."
98,4.0,"Keen on getting some good snaps taken in Korea? You should visit this place. it was a wonderful time pass for our family. My daughter (11 months at the time) clearly enjoyed every bit but hardly understood anything. Extremely creative place, one is sure to be amazed by the artistic skills used within,,,,"
99,4.0,The trick eye museum was a fun way to spent a couple of hours. It basically is taking pictures of yourself in the trick eye sets. We also did the ice museum we where only in there for a couple of minutes took some photos and got out because it was freezing.
100,5.0,"So much fun and a ton of picture opportunities. You get all three for the price of one. Ice, Carnival and Trick Eye. One of my favorite museums."
101,5.0,"Not surprising that this place has become so famous in Seoul. You'd wanna come here for bright emotions and laughs. And, of course, the photos are mind-blogging. Definitely worth checking out."
102,5.0,it was indeed a fun activity for everyone. one of the kind and i guess a pioneer in this kind of activity. we went here around late afternoon... i guess it is their peak hour... but it doesnt matter... we did enjoy our time and a must for anyone who will visit seoul.
103,3.0,"The entrance ticket cost 15,000KRW and that includes the Trick Eye Museum, The Ice Room and the Street Carnival. It is located very close to the Hongdae Nanta Theater and there are signs around there letting you know it is in the general vicinity. We went in and took some pretty cool pics but the route wasnâ€™t very extensive. We made the mistake of going around 4:00pm which was about the time many high school kids were out of school and decided to go at that time too. Thus, we had to often wait for a chance to take a pic. I imagine you should go earlier and youâ€™d probably have the entire place to yourself. The Ice Room was actually very cold as it is a tiny place set in minus 7 degree weather. I think they are trying to replicate the real life Ice Museum. You can finish the pics there in about 5 minutes. The Street Carnival was very lame with half of the games broken and the other half are carnival games for a fee. It was pretty lame so we left. The entire experience is about 1 hour long and the bus ride took longer for us to get out here thus I wouldnâ€™t recommend you coming out just for the museum and only come if you had planned dinner or a walk down Hongdae Shopping Street."
104,5.0,"This museum is loads of fun. We took about 150 photos of us interacting with the 3D art. It made us feel like youngsters again. As we were a couple traveling by ourselves, everyone was quite nice about taking photos of us together. And we reciprocated. The museum was a bit tricky to find but well worth it. The museum is located in the trendy Hongdae Neighborhood that is home to many universities. Great for people watching, street food, shopping, and visiting cafes/bars."
105,4.0,"It is a nice place to go as a couple, friends, or with your kids. But definitely not alone!Bring your camera with you and try to get the best shot!Worth the visit, and can be a good alternative to spend your day if it's raining.Could have been a bit cheaper."
106,4.0,"Fun way to spend an hour taking pictures of all the exhibits. Be prepared to lay on the floors for good shots.Also, there are tourist discounts if you print the voucher online."
107,5.0,"It was our first time visiting this place and fun it amusing. The pictures were funny and we,made some good memories."
108,2.0,"Considering the high rating and feedback for Trickeye Museum I was definitely disappointed. Once you have paid and get in and see what it's all about, you just have to make the most of it. 30,000 won for 2 adults to walk around and take silly photos for 20 minutes was just a bit too much for us. I can see that this may be a fun thing for those with children but then perhaps the art isn't suited towards children necessarily. I personally do not recommend this attraction."
109,4.0,"We went as a couple, which is fine, but it would probably be better with a group of people. There are a lot of pieces that need two people and we had to keep bothering others to help us take a picture. Good place to goof around and be silly. You go to the ice museum (complete with ice slide) first, which is also neat. Make sure your camera/phone is charged for lots and lots of picture taking! There is a locker that you can put all your stuff in. It's not free, but I can't remember how much it was. Just a few hundred won."
110,4.0,Went here in the late evening about an hour before they closed. It was very quiet which made it easier to take the pictures we wanted to take. I would recommend a visit if you have the time and funds but not a necessary stop in Seoul.
111,4.0,"Nicely designed place not too big, lots of interesting props that you want to be pictured in. You must go in without an hang ups to enjoy, I suppose the young would enjoy very much but me at 61 together with my Wife also enjoyed it too."
112,5.0,"Lots of fun with optical illusions. Get creative. Lots of laughter involved..Most importantly, don't forget your camera!"
113,4.0,"This museum was very fun for taking funny photos! Don't go there on your own, take someone with you or with bunch of friends :) There was also ice museum inside"
114,5.0,"This was one of the highlight of our trip. We had so much fun, we laughed our heads off. Use your imagination for your poses. Definitely not kid friendly. some objects are PG 18."
115,1.0,"Totally crowded, not a fun place for adults at all (and we are not old and are up for a laugh) but the obsession with technology in this country causes selfie mania and it makes it impossible to enjoy this.  Its for children, we couldn't understand why it would be marketed at adults!"
116,3.0,"In my eye, it is not that suprised. My fiance had a good time but I am not. I have seen few times before in internet. It was very similar."
117,5.0,"This was a nice break from going around to all the touristy spots in Seoul. Granted, there are a lot of tourists who come to this museum, it was nice to just relax and have some fun taking silly photos! We picked up a flyer for the museum at one of the information centers around Seoul, which gave us a little discount. The ticket included entrance to the Ice Museum (Same building), which was cool too (but very cold!). Here's the best part - we thought this place was randomly in the middle of nowhere... only to realize afterward we were right next to Hongdae Collegetown, which is FILLED with awesome street vendors (food, clothes, accessories, etc.) as well as bunch of restaurants, cosmetic shops, clubs, and bars! So be sure to check it out!"
118,5.0,One of best museums to watch..... really wonderful. .. better than alive... also watch Ice & Love museum along with it..
119,5.0,We had a lot of fun though we had to wait for people to take their pictures. We helped some and they helped us in return though they were some who just ran away after we helped take their pictures. The girl and the guy at the payment counter were really nice. She happened to be at the entrance of the ice museum as well when we went there. She's lovely and gave us a discount and helped us out. A good place to relax and have fun.
120,4.0,"With tons of photo spots, it's a great place for a family with older kids. The experience when you're there is okay, but looking at photos later on will be much more fun--and funny."
121,4.0,Its fun and imaginative. I was told that cheaper tickets can be bought onlihe through prior booking.  I wasnt sure..as we went on a whim and fancy .  It wasnt planned for.
122,4.0,"Recently they added a new ice museum which gets really cold really quickly. It's not very big so you can probably survive without a jacket but I think it's worth taking. The trickeye museum was pretty cool, it had a lot of 3d artwork you could be apart of though I think my partner and I found it a little repetitive by the end. Worth a visit though!"
123,5.0,We found out about the trickeye as we were doing the Blue House tour and saw one of the paintings on display. So we headed over there and had a blast snapping pics in funny poses. They look great on Facebook :)Enjoy this place. Surprised there aren't more of them.
124,5.0,"I am so happy that we went to the Trick Eye Museum. It wasn't on our agenda but we ran into an acquaintance on our bus to Seoul, and she suggested it. I'm so glad we took her advice; this place is awesome!If you're looking for a couple hours of off-the-beaten-path fun, this place is your go to! There are so many photo opportunities to take creative and hilarious pictures that will last with you forever! Escape from being eaten by a giant fish! Climb up a bamboo tree with a panda! Become one of Degas' famous ballerinas! The options are endless.There is even a photo kiosk where you can connect your phone to the machine via bluetooth and print photos you just took for a small fee.The 15,000 KRW admission also includes the Ice Museum. It's a small museum, which is fine because it's -2 degrees C and you don't want to be in there for very long!!This museum is in Hongdae which also has a lot to offer and is a great area to explore.Now go have some fun!!"
125,5.0,This museum was awesome with plenty of fun photos to take. Each scene has a photo guide to help you pose correctly. Entrance to the Trickeye also gives you entrance to the Ice Museum which is in the same building. Would recommend this museum for anyone who loves to take photos of themselves.
126,3.0,"You may spend your time taking photo with creative pose but too bad, I'm not good in that. Is a small place. Quite crowded and sometimes gotta wait to take photos."
127,3.0,"The place seems popular enough and claim to be one of the top rated attractions in Seoul in 2014, I don't see it. It's an ok way of killing an hour on a rainy day and probably worth the visit with kids but I should have had a beer or two before visiting this Trick Eye place, I might have enjoyed it more. The 15k ticker/adult includes a ticket to the ice land, a small freezing room with some cool ice sculptures and an ice slide that awoke the child in me more than a of the trick eye attractions did, or maybe it was the caramel  latte bought in the lobby that gave me a two hour long sugar rush that did. Save this place for a day when you just don't want to be outside due to bad weather."
128,4.0,"Good fun, silly and great value for money! Well situated and easy to find. Had a great time here playing with the exhibits - all designed so you can take photos. If you get bored of the palaces then head here."
129,4.0,"Quite similar to Ripley's in Melbourne, but I must say this place has a lot more funny art pieces. Definitely a must-see when you're visiting with friends who doesn't mind getting down on their feet, stretching and being creative with your expressions for great photo moments! We had fun for sure!"
130,5.0,Great place and we had so much fun! I would recommend this place for anyone on holiday in Seoul but make sure you have a good camera or mobile phone that takes decent photos!
131,4.0,I got it really cheap from Coupang and we need some indoor sightseeing (it's so cold outside now in Seoul!) I went there during weekday evening so the queue was close to none. It's fun to take a few extra expressions from every single stop so you can easily spend an hour or pushing two hard there...hahaha not recommended for solo traveller because you need to be in the picture to be interesting! ;)
132,5.0,"We had the most amazing time at the Trickeye Museum. Each exhibit actually has a picture that shows you how the picture could look if you photograph it right but of course the end product is entirely up to whatever you imagine. We spent about 2 hours here and could have stayed longer messing around with taking pictures if we didn't have to check out of our hotel at noon. I hight recommend this place...but if you go make sure you have someone to take a picture of you. If you are a person alone, its kind of hard to beg people to constantly take pictures of you. If you are a couple, you still have to take pictures of yourself. If you have friends...or if you have money to buy friends maybe you can get someone to go with you and take pictures of you. It is well worth the experience and the awesome pictures that come out of it."
133,4.0,"Print out the discount coupon online before you go to enjoy some minor discounts off the entrance fee. The attraction was not bad, quite entertaining for about an hour or two. Try to go early to minimise the crowds forming later on."
134,4.0,"I'm not sure why TA doesn't have a category between 'average' and 'very good'? What happened to just plain old 'good'?Anyway, The Trickeye Museum is a fun place to while away an hour. You can get some great photos but it will help things enormously if you have an outgoing personality. Are you the sort of person who doesn't mind striking a ridiculous pose while others are waiting and watching?The worst parts for me were accidentally walking into other people's photos (which you will do a lot) and some poses and positions take quite a lot of skill in order to get the photo just right. You don't always have time to take photo after photo to get the perfect shot.A place to go with family or friends rather than couples (especially if one of you has a shy disposition)"
135,5.0,"Great and funny museum, of course you should visit with at least 2 persons.There are plenty of pictures, all with instructions on the best photo angle and position.In the same building, you will find the ""Ice Museum"" and ""Love Museum (18+)"".A ticket for Trickeye + Ice is around 18.000 KRW and visit time around 1 hour (if you manage to survive longer in the Ice Museum is up to you hahaha)."
136,4.0,"It's fun. Felt so young again, as tried hard on posture as per the samples photos provided. Enjoy fun sliding down an ice slide in ICE museum. We missed the LOVE Museum as short of time."
137,3.0,"It was an interesting attraction and quite fun taking goofy pictures. But that's about it. I find it too expensive for the whole experience. Also, it is not the place where you can say it's uniquely South Korean."
138,4.0,"The trickeye museum is quite equipped, having so many displays and sections that after a while it tired us out. It is a good thing though as you do get value for your money."
139,4.0,"Hardly a ""museum"" but rather a very nice collection of interactive optical illusions.The place is divided into two sections.The bigger section includes several rooms with numerous optical illusions - some funny, some scary and some - really good!Everyone becomes a kid when it comes to optical illusions, and this is why this place is great for kids and adults alike - it's simply THAT fun! :)The second section is a tiny ""Ice museum"", where several models are built from ice and there's an ice slide as well.Naturally, it's freezing in there, and despite getting some plastic coat to wear inside, anything over 5 minutes would give you a cold (we visited during the summer and were dressed accordingly).All in all, both sections ought to take apx. 2 hours to complete.Don't miss it - it's a lot of fun! :)"
140,5.0,"Went with my parents who are in their 70's and it was great to see them having so much fun posing in all the different arts, and taking pictures of us too being silly.  It was time and money well spent"
141,2.0,Too crowded when we visit and hardly can take any picture. Some of the tourist even jump queue or block your shots.Really irritating and spoiled our mood.Probably will be better if less crowd Will suggest the Alive Museum in N Seoul Tower since the images there are much more interesting (just my opinion)
142,5.0,"My wife and I had a great time taking pictures in this museum. Although both of us felt tired and exhausted after the entire journey, we find this museum is hilarious too. it is also interesting to watch other patrons coordinate among themselves to take nice pictures. I wonder if the set-up is deliberately made slight different from Singapore."
143,4.0,Had good fun walking through. Was fun watching other families coordinate the photo taking. We didn't take many ourselves but the ones where we did came out great! We weren't intending on making the visit to Hongdae especially for trick eye but we stumbled across it and went in whilst we were there. Definitely go if you have kids; they'll love it.
144,5.0,trickeye museum is very fascinating!  very very creative. my husband and I love it. first time we went to that kind of museum. we had an amazing experience when we visited to that place.
145,4.0,"it is lots of fun to taking photos at this trickeye museum. Some of the background are mind opening and when the picture is present at a different angle, you can create an illusion that you are floating in the air."
146,5.0,"Maximum fun and shooting, an interesting place where you can spend time with your friends , inside it's a cute cafe to"
147,2.0,"We definitely felt tricked, since the only thing you could do is take photos of yourself. Spent 5 minutes walking through the place. Ice museum was not impressive either, especially if you come from a country that has snow."
148,3.0,"This museum is fun, but it's really just an expensive way to take some cheesy photos. I'm glad I went once, but wouldn't go a second time. If you search youtube for a channel called ""eat your kimchi"", they do a good review (including video) of that this museum is all about."
149,4.0,"I wouldn't miss this if you were visiting Seoul. My fiance and I had a blast.. .but it was BUSY. I would look into going during their slower hours.. whenever those are. If you can't avoid the rush though, go anyway."
150,4.0,went there with my partner and was amaze by the effect of the picture we took. good place to bond with family and fun and laughter follow while taking pictures. but because it might be crowded thus sometimes you cannot take a lot of pose. but nevertheless its a good place for family and couples.
151,4.0,"This is a fun place to take photos with visual effects. This museum is one level below the ""Love Museum"", so at first we were a little taken back and wondered if we reached the right place. Anyway, the various 3D effects ranged from cute, fun, and simply unbelievable. There is a lot of creativity put into each set. Since it is for picture taking, it's best to go during off-hours on a weekday, so you don't run into crowds. There is actually another Trickeye Museum in Jeju. Although the sets are different, I think going to one is enough of an experience, so plan accordingly. :-)"
152,4.0,"Some of the 3D paintings make for excellent photo ops and I found it really fun to pose for the photos.  It's exciting and unusual compared to the standard Seoul attraction.  However, if you're not going to take photos or you're going on your own, I can imagine it would be boing.  It's all about the pics!"
153,3.0,Fun place to hang if you've got a couple of spare hours (or if it's raining). Very cool place to get 'tricked' and take pictures.
154,5.0,"A bit tucked away in hongdae, but an impressive and fun little museum to spend a few hours in. Lots of photo ops and a perfect activity for a rainy day in Seoul."
155,3.0,"This place contains a bunch of tricky pictures that fools the eye. Not very ""artistic"" so don't expect beautiful paintings. Families seemed to have a blast here. And that being said, it will take you a long time to even get a chance to take a photo. It will be crowded (and noisy). And also, they do charge a hefty sum to enter, 15000 won per person. Although it will include admission to a small room with some ice sculptures."
156,4.0,"Found out about this place from a guide book. Would only say a few things about here its not easy to find and you can easily walk past this place because the museum is located in a basement. Now for the Museum its not very big, and not a ton of trick art work, Can easily be in and out of here within less than an hour, however If your just looking for something different to do and want some funny photos its worth the short time to come"
157,4.0,"You can spend a lot of time taking picture and play with visual illusion :) its worth place to visit in Seoul.Cons: some directions lines to take the picture is gone, so it's little bit difficult for visitors who want to take picture from the best position"
158,4.0,"The museum is definitely interesting in concept and has a lot of work and thought put into it. However, if you simply don't like taking photos (like my boyfriend =(( ) it doesn't really worth visit, because taking funny and smart photos are basically all you can do there."
159,4.0,"If you like art and optical illusion, this is a place you should check out in KoreaThere is a number of art you can interact with and have 3D effects"
160,5.0,We miss out Jeju trip hence we decided to try Seoul's Trickeye museum located at Hongkik University subway station. Seoul's trickeye comes with Ice museum which is really absolutely freezing cold in there (please bring thicker jackets to enter else you will freeze for sure!)There's quite a fair bit of pictures to pose with. Majority of them turns out real funny. You won't feel shy posing strangely cos everyone else will be doing that. Theres a sex museum on the highest floor if you would like visit big boobs museum haha. However you will have to pay for that museum entry. It aint complimentary with trickeye. Highly recommend everyone else to head there to have the fun of your time!
161,5.0,"We found this via Trip advisor so decided to check it out. Wish we read the post about the discount coupon first. We paid 15,000 won each for a combined Trickeye and Ice house visit. It was fun taking various photos, so be sure to bring a camera. Everyone seemed willing to take pictures of us, and then we would reciprocate and take pictures of them. That way couples can get photos with both people in it.The ice house was very cold (like being in a meat locker) so bring a jacket if you want to spend some time there.We wish we got a locker at the entrance for my granny pack and wife's purse so we wouldn't have to keep putting our stuff on the floor for each photo. Lockers are available.We spent about 2 hours here and recommend it."
162,4.0,Great fun especially when not crowded. Couple of art works were under maintenance that is a pity. Ice museum is for free but if not prepared you won't be there more than 5 minutes
163,3.0,Not a very big and spacious area but the pictures are unique. Great experience taking photos there. However you might need to queue for each photo.
164,3.0,"Not the easliest place to find as there is not obvious signs which one would be expecting it.I had actually walked passed it without realising it and got lost trying to locate it.the Museum is small and so when there is a crowd, it may be difficult to take photos with peopl standing in the way. my friend who had went to another trickeye museum in another country commented that the photos i had looks more ""real"" than the ones he had taken.Overall had an enjoyable experience. for those who are carry a bag there, advice is to put it in the lockers outside the toilet."
165,4.0,"Having been to the Trickeye Museum in Jeju, I feel that this one is smaller in size and space to take photos. They tend to overlap each other when you try to step back and take a shot. But the quality of their painting is better maintained than the one in Jeju (or so I think). Better to go in bigger groups."
166,5.0,"Paid a discounted admission fee of KRW12,000 per pax for both the Trickeye & Ice Museum (instead of the usual KRW15,000 using the discount coupon valid till 31 Dec 2014 - please refer and print this out - http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/HD/event/enu_20140114/trickeye_enu.jsp). One discount coupon can be used for up to 4 persons so save the earth and print where necessary :)Recommend those with shoulder length/long hair to tie up their hair and in general, wear comfortable clothes (not too loose fitting) so that you can get the best shots even in awkward positions (especially for pictures which are supposed turn out to have you look like you are upside down, you would not want your hair/clothes defying gravity). It can be quite tiring to keep posing for the different shots but very fun.They have pictorial guides for each art trick on how you should pose to get the best out of the art trick but feel free to unleash your creativity! Would be good to think of what pose you want before hogging the art trick. One downside was that the spotlight was too bright for the various art tricks making it a little difficult getting the right angle without the capturing light on the art trick (or maybe its just my poor photography skills).We did not know that the discounted coupon covers for the Ice Museum as well and did not prepare the right attire for it so we only spent less than 10 mins inside as it was too cold (-3degrees). It is very small, mainly pretty ice sculptures and a mini slide which you can try.We visited the museum on Friday (25 April 2014) at about 11am and it was quite crowded. Best to go in the morning when you have more energy (not after a day of shopping unless you are very confident of your stamina and energy level) and the crowd should also be less.Nearest station: Hongik University Station (Hongdae)"
167,4.0,"It was cute to see everyone wanting to get in these photos. Some were quite good. A bit small and crowded. If you're an adult, the sex ""museum"" directly above the trick eye is like the same thing except with absurd sex scenarios."
168,4.0,"Well worth visiting if you're in Hongdae,lots of fun and something different.Not easy to find,we had a map but only found it after asking one of the ""red angel"" info people who walk around helping tourists.Was able to get a discount after printing off a voucher from their website."
169,5.0,"Your ticket includes both trick eye museum and the ice museum. We read some previous reviews about the museum looking run down so we didn't have any expectations of the trick eye museum to begin with but we definitely were in for a pleasant surprise! We had a lot of fun taking pictures and posing. We spent at least 1.5 hours in the trick eye museum and it was a week day. You do spend a bit of time waiting in lines for your turn to take pictures but it is not bad. While you wait, you can look at the photo guides posted next to the pictures and think of some creative posts for yourselves. We saw a lot of people randomly taking pictures without paying attention to how the pictures will turn out. In my opinion, it seems like such a waste of time because the whole point is to bring out the unique 3D effects. On your ticket, it gives you tips on how to take good pictures and what angles to take pictures from. Pay attention to it if you want your pictures to turn out great. I would also recommend renting a locker to put away your jacket and bags so you don't need to worry about them inside the museum. I personally enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend it to anyone who is visiting Seoul!"
170,3.0,"Not all is done by painting and quite majority do have tools ""assist"". Also not all have location ""guide"" on which angle to snap for best result"
171,5.0,Went on Monday morning around 10am but already got tourist crowds but still not too bad since manage to take most of the photos within a min. Place is abit hard to find as we cannot find Exit 9 from the subway and ended up walking to another direction but luckily managed to find it subsequently...
172,5.0,It's really nice to go there because you can take photos of yourself with the museum display and it look so real! There is also a ice museum located inside the trick ice museum! It's simply amazing.
173,4.0,The Trickeye Museum is a whole lot of fun and would be great for kids. We are a couple in our early twenties and had an excellent time and a lot of laughs going through the museum it's very clever and a really good spot for taking photos.
174,5.0,"I went with my partner and it was sooo much fun! Took heaps of photos! It was a bit crowded after lunch, so I would recommend to get there on a weekday and early if possible. There was also an ice museum and love museum on that day we went there. Highly recommended!"
175,4.0,"If you like posing and taking funny photo, this is the right place for you. It is ideal for couple, friends and family to visit and have fun over here. The place is located at Hongdae, but it is easily miss it as it is at the basement of building. You can easily spend hours inside the museum just to take cute and funny photo. Not advice if you going there alone."

And did we get a big smile on our face by the end of our mini tour?  Yup.Kids would definitely have fun, and adults with a relaxed sense of humor do too.  The ice museum, though, is barely worth the trip."
177,4.0,"Went on a Friday afternoon. The place was already starting to get crowded when we walk in. Would be better to come on a less crowded day as all of us were fighting for space and chances to take pictures which makes it kinda frustrating. But overall we had a fun afternoon playing around with the effects at this museum.If you are feeling generous (money wise), you can opt for caricatures/oil paint drawings and also get professional photographs taken of yourself in hanbok (note: quite pricey here)"
178,4.0,"It was quite easy to find this place by the map listed on the website. Trickeye Museum also includes a ticket into the Ice Museum where it is seriously cold.Each painting requires the right camera angle to get right, and no flash as well as that spoils the photo. It is fun to try different poses to the as-suggested ones."
179,4.0,Great place to unwind after long walk from the city. You would be amazed by the place. A good location too. Located near a lot of restaurants and near the subway station of Hongkik University. Dont forget to bring your camera.
180,3.0,Interesting wall pictures but it's not very big.And quite crowded hence it's a bit difficult to take clear pictures
181,5.0,"It is the most expensive museum we have visited in Seoul but we had great fun! Though in our 50s, we enjoyed the interactive exhibits. It can be a bit difficult to locate from the Hongdae subway station. Ask the friendly folks. After the musuem, enjoy the vibe  in Hongdae just steps from the entrance."
182,5.0,"It's really fun! Spend an hour there just posing and taking photos, but it was a hoot and riot. Don't miss the Love Museum upstairs as it's so very funny too!"
183,4.0,"We went there around 7:30 PM. It is a bit hidden, so keep your eyes open for the Tony Moly outlet. The museum would be on your right. Anyway, you can easily spend a solid 2 hours inside this museum trying out various angles at each drawings. A very fun filled evening indeed. And by the way the entrance fees would include a visit into the ice museum IMHO is such a bore. Anyway, would recommend this museum if you happen to be around the Hongdae area."
184,4.0,this exhibition is amazing as u can take photo with 3D effect from certain angle. worth the trip. but u need to pay a small sum. there is also a ice room with u can play under freezing condition.
185,4.0,"We visited the Trickeye Museum, which is located in the Hongik University area. It was pretty fun as you can take lots of photos with the paintings there. However, this place is packed with tourists and seems like the locals are not fully aware of it. It will be a good idea to rent one of their lockers to store your personal belongings so you can freely post and play around inside the museum and probably try to find a way to get a nice photo without other people getting into your shot."
186,5.0,There are two museums you can visit with the entrance fee. Better to try ice museum first. The trick eye museum is like an art gallery where you can pose with and its like being in the porttrait itself. Its like 3D artworks.TIP: its a few steps at the back of taco bell which is across the daiso store in hongdae
187,4.0,funny museum that located in HongDae area.. it's good for first time visitor.. we were having a great time to snap photos but one thing which make me annoyed was the space is not big enough and during peak session and many visitor who will block your way while u are taking photos..
188,5.0,"Initially we thought we would spend just an hour at this place. However, by the time we left, it was almost 2.5 hours later. I really wanted to take photos of every single trick-eye picture here. But that would be too exhausting. Nonetheless, we had a really good time."
189,5.0,"it was very fun but tiring doing all the different postures! there was minimal or no air conditioner thus was very warm. by the time we finish posing, we are already perspiring. depending on the timing that you go, you may need to wait for your turn to take the photos. overall, gd experience and may go again to finish those unfulfilled pose!"
190,5.0,A brilliant idea for a museum. A little pricey and best if you go with a crowd for the best photos! But a great way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon.
191,5.0,"As soon as you walk in, you spot wonderful opportunities to photo bomb famous works of art, a great way to create wonderful memories. Also, check out the ice museum... it get freezing cold quickly"
192,5.0,"Found the Museum at once. No signage no. Very interesting place. Made a lot of impressive photos. Also visited the Ice Museum . In the end we have drawn on a us caricature. Visit for sure. Entrance toTrickeye Museum and the Ice Museum 15,000 KRW."
193,5.0,Took guests from out of town and my teen sons.  ALL had a great time.  Every single piece has photo options to play.  Bring your camera and smile a lot!  Loads of restaurants in the neighborhood
194,5.0,This stop was at the top of my list when visiting Seoul. It's an amazing 3 dimensional art museum and the photo opportunities were abundant. We spent three wonderful hours here and enjoyed every minute of it.  There is a small fee for the entrance but well worth it. The Hello Kitty Cafe is around the corner as well. A fun way to spend a few hours! Make the effort to come to this museum.
195,4.0,"It was a warm day in Seoul, and we decided to check out this interesting museum instead of the usual sightseeing. I must say it is quite an enjoyable 2hours intense camera clicking. You will find yourself trying to figure out different ways to take the pictures form different angles. Do keep you bags at the lockers provided so you dont have keep finding a place to put your belonging every 5 seconds (Yes that's the avg frequency for every pictures taken within the 2 hours).It was a saturday we went, so there was more crowd than usual days (especially the young kids who are crazy about taking pictures). If you are unsure how to take a good shot, look out for ""picture poin"" indication, or samples of pictures that is always nearby each scene. I especially like the room where one person is bigger than another - that's awesome!!!"
196,4.0,"The Trickeye Museum is located in the basement of a building close to the University. With a mobile map in hand, it is not too difficult to find. It's a great way to spend an hour or so. It's not too big to be overwhelming, nor too small to be considered over-priced. You simply follow a route past each painting, and hopefully there are not too many people around so you can get a clear shot. Fortunately for us, it was not that busy on a Saturday morning. Conveniently, they provide guides on the wall (and on the floor) to aid you in getting the best shot possible. Some pics are best captured with two or even 4 people. The staff were very helpful in helping to take pics too. Not cheap, but worth a visit."
197,5.0,"It's a great and funny place with pictures on walls that seem to be real, like you are inside the picture. Great place for taking funny photos."
198,5.0,This place is fantastic. Don't forget your camera. It was not crowded and took about an hour to get around the whole place. We followed the Government tourism websites directions and could not find the place. Take exit 9 of Hongik university station then ask at a local store. Definately worth a visit and a lot of fun. Don't go alone as you need a friend or two to take photos.
199,4.0,"Its a nice place, with a cheap entry fee. The setting and paintings are very good, altough there is room for improvement."
