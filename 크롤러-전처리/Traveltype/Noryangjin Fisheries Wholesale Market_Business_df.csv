Upstairs Resturants will prepare what you buy but did not try this. Others say it was very expensive. Suggest negotiating before purchase."
1,5.0,"Was there towards the end of the day with colleagues. The market was still rather active, more sellers than buyers at that time of the day. Assortments, types of live seafoods were incredible.We bought several types of fish, abalone, prawn and brought them to the restaurants upstairs. It was packed, very crowded. Nonetheless, the fish prepared in sashimi style, except abalone and prawn, which were steamed, were served in no time. Very fresh and so tasty.Highly recommended for seafood lovers."
2,4.0,"The fish market is a fascinating place to visit - probably not the sort of thing high on people's list of ""things to do"", but it is well worth a visit.  There is a wet and dry fish market.  The former is full of fascinating fish and shellfish (etc!).  You can purchase some fish and have it prepared by one of the restaurants around the market."
3,5.0,"If you like fresh sea food and enjoy authentic experience, then this is the place for you! We loved every minutes of it and the food and service, despite the language barrier, was exceptional."
4,5.0,"This fish market is smaller than the Tsukiji one in Tokyo, but there is one big difference, you can actually select the seafood (most are still alive) and have them deliver to a restaurant on the second floor to have it prepared the way you like. There are dozens of stalls each with tanks of live seafood - it is fascinating just walking from stall to stall and looking at the seafood. I was lucky to come with a local Korean so language is no barrier. The lobster and crab were huge - but for two of us, we selected abalones, clams and a fish. The fish was prepared 3 ways - Sashimi, grilled and the bones used as delicious fish soup. The abalone was grilled with butter while the clams were steamed. It was absolutely delicious. It was mid-priced - not cheap, but given the freshness and convenience, definately worth coming back."
5,4.0,"Whoever invented the fish market with attached restaurant was a genius. Because what better way to entice customers into consuming a highly perishable food than offering to cook it right then and there?Here’s a fish market with the luscious lobster, springy calamari and plump shrimp I want on my lunch plate or dinner table tonight. This Seoul destination also functions as a eatery, complete with floor seating and table service on the upper level. What you’re buying here may or may not be, but it’s high quality and a worthy splurge.The most remarkable part of the market is its expansive selection of whole fish as well as live seafood, including eels, crabs, lobsters and sea urchin. Browsing the colorful, enticing sea creatures is irreplaceable. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"

7,5.0,"Got here by invitation of my Regional Managing Director while we have a meeting back in our Headquarter in Seoul. He invite me to have the best seafood ever.And it happen to be the best seafood ever I've ever had.Don't expect this place is a fancy and clean market. This fish market is really a market. There will be puddles everywhere.But it is a heaven for seafood lovers. They provide hundred types fish, crabs, prawns, squids, etcAnd down stair on the basement, you may find one restaurant to cook over the fish you already picked upstairs. So it is really FRESH.This place is worth to visit. It is about 30 minutes from Jamsil area, by taxi. There might be some traffic density during peak hours and weekend dinner."
8,5.0,"Not exactly an easy place to find.Buying the seafood is easy if you can speak Mandarin, most seafood stalls engage Chinese workers.Getting the resturant to cook the dishes for you is the challenging part.You need a local Korean to help you on this.I was hosted by local Korean friend, so that save me the headache. Be prepared to pay the price, being in ""market"" doesn't mean it is cheap. Firstly, there is the ingredient price from your seafood shopping, next there is the cooking price you pay the resturant to cook and serve you.Overall was a positive and interesting experience."
9,4.0,"Disgusting, intriguing, disheartening, clean, not smelly, organized, noisy, amazing...hey, it's a fish market. But you won't find restaurants in the morning - - - my mistake. Giant octopi, lobsters, crabs, everything you can imagine from the sea. Sad to think how the oceans are being depleted daily by this place, but still, incredible to see."
10,2.0,it seems to be overpriced and it is really hard to communicate -i went twice (I love fresh seafood) but was twice disappointed
11,2.0,the market shows a large variety of fishes and seafood -you can buy your choice and goo to one of the many restaurants either on the 2nd flor or on the basement. The fish prices seem to be overprised if yo compare it with the supermarkt fish section and you have the feeling that as a tourist you are a bit ripped off
12,5.0,"Just next to the Noryangjin train station. Worth the while to visit, opens 24 hrs. Grab some fish, the fishmonger will slice it fresh. Bring to a nearby stall for nice broth. Freshest sashimi you can get. Go for the spicy soup, goes well with sole fish."
13,5.0,"Super fresh seafood, super-cheap - we bought 2 flounder, 2 long fish and some huge cockles, the stall owners gutted and scaled the fish, all for about $7! Took them to a little cafe place downstairs and they made ann incredible 3 course meal - fried flounder, various kim chii type plates and seafood soup. With the atmosphere, the quality of the seafood and especially the melt-in-the-mouth flounder - instantly became one of my top 10 meals anywhere any time. And very low stress market. No hassling. Outstanding. On subway line 1, across the river."
14,5.0,"Not really! I am sure they get to that size due to the colder northern waters. Coming from a seafood and fish country myself I was still amazed at the selection and size of the shellfish especially. It's all rather overwhelming and the language barrier doesnt help. It would be good to go there with a local host ot help guide you through the experience. My colleague and I just took the Metro there and ventured on our own. After doing a full tour of the place, we decided to buy some fish and a giant sea snail.Within minutes, the fish went from swimming to being served to us as sashimi in the simple restaurant downstairs. The head and other parts were made into a spicy soup with vegetables whilst the giant snail was served steamed.I recommend this place to all foodies. It is great for Muslim travellers as the whole place is effectively halal."
