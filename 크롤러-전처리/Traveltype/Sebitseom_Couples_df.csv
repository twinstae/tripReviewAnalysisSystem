0,3.0,. . . be sure to take notice of Some Sevit on the western side of the Banpo Bridge. There are three artifical islands with modern buildings with colors changing as night falls.
1,3.0,There is a shuttle bus you can take at exit 6 of Express Bus Terminal station to bring you here. We were not aware and walked a long long way from the train station. Took the shuttle bus back to the train station. We came in the afternoon. Believe the view and the lights will make it worthwhile to visit this place in the evening. So do come in the evening.
2,5.0,These awesome islands are famous for the 'Avengers: Age of ultron'. We were just riding the bicycle then suddenly encountered these beautiful islands. The light is so spectacular and there are several places for chillimg. My girlfriend also loved it.
3,4.0,"Having seen the movie ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", I found the architecture of these artificial islands (or islets) in the Han River in Seoul, which were featured in the film, to be striking and futuristic, so I was determined to see them for myself when visiting Seoul.They are a little difficult to get to now (March 2016) via public transport, as there is a lot of building work going on (numerous apartment complexes are being torn down and rebuilt), but preserve, as once you get past the building work, you get to a nice park, popular with the locals, down by the Hangang.Okay, it's not quite as cool as if they were really robotics laboratories harbouring evil AI or whatever as in the movie, but they are still very interesting structures.  Each is different and with a different name.We had a drink there, overlooking the river, and used the facilities.They are at they're most striking lit up at night."
4,4.0,Nice architecture along Hangang (River). Many restaurants around this place. It's better to come around evening.... nice scenery.
