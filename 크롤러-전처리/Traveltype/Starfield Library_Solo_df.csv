1,5.0,Love this library. Its  fancy... but  simply artistic. Ive taken multiple selfies during my visit. I passed this site  multple times as  this is  near  the venue  of  our convention.
2,5.0,"This place is really a god send in the large COEX mall and really you can not believe you stepped into a library. Public space meets a library, where people indeed linger and enjoy themselves. One element to make a simple mall stand out."
3,4.0,Starfield is a nice mall to shop if your into big budget shopping. It has all the luxurious items you can name.
4,5.0,It’s super chilled to take a rest here and even read a book. Or just sit down and listen to the calm music which is playing there. Really calm and chilled place. Easy to find in the Starfield mall. You can take the metro to Samseung (World Trade center). 
5,5.0,"Un-expected such a stunning huge library with artistic deco. Whoever in Seoul, should visit the library and spends some time of exposure the area and books. Worth of visit to this place."
6,5.0,"Students would surely love to go to libraries if there are places like this in every country. It's so stunning! It's not just perfect for studying and having some ""me-time"", but also a perfect place for an instagrammable photo."
7,5.0,"The library is amazing!! Super clean, clear and everything a library shoud be. There are also foreigner books and magazines. I loved!"
8,3.0,"Interesting concept, but it's really just a library in the middle of a shopping mall. Can get busy at times with tourists taking pictures. There are also events happening at the library itself (e.g. launch of new book etc) so expect the place to be noisy and chaotic."
9,5.0,"This Awesome & Amazing Library is located in Starfield COEX - Seoul, in Gangnam area. It's very huge and has tons of books & magazines. Most of them are in Korean. The design & decoration are very nice & beautiful. It's a new spot to drop by. It's very crowded during weekend."
10,5.0,"For some reason, I didn't know that this library was in Coex Mall so when I stumbled across it I was delighted. It's as beautiful as the pictures show and the architecture and thought put into its design is really quite spectacular."
11,4.0,"Very beautiful design and architecture; it wasn’t too crowded on a Thursday afternoon, so great for chilling and reading. But Coex Mall - where the library is housed in - can be very confusing to navigate through."
12,4.0,"I'm a big bookworm, so I loved going to this place even though most of their books are in Korean I still enjoyed seeing all the books and not to mention the 13m bookshelves that displayed books and magazines.  This library also has the most magazines you can find here in Korea, and they have an up to date e-book system as well. If you love taking pictures, this would be a great place to get some of those Instagram-worthy pictures and for the sake of content too for bloggers and vloggers."
13,4.0,Definitely worth a visit if you are staying nearby or plan to do some shopping in the mall. Very inviting atmosphere during both the day and night.
14,5.0,An open space library. Very impressive. They also have an English section. Will definitely spend more time here tomorrow.
15,4.0,"I'm not really a book lover but this place made me want to get a good book, sit in the corner and read as much as I can. I like that there are many people actually reading, because I kinda expected most of them would just be taking pictures. There were shelves that need to be filled. And I hope they add some books in different languages so that foreign visitors can also read in there.Will I come back? Yes and I will recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul, especially for solo travelers"
16,4.0,"Located within the COEX mall, surrounded by clothing stores and restaurants, the Starfield Library is a nice place to sit down and take a break from a long day of site seeing in the area. One can easily get a coffee at any of the many shops nearby and read a magazine and relax at this exciting library."
17,4.0,The library is really awe-inspiring. I read that there are English books but I didn't bother to look for it. A really good spot to sit and soak in the bookish atmosphere before hitting the stores in COEX mall.
18,5.0,"If you're visiting Coex, worth stop by to see how they utilize the space, interior design, etc.The library has 50 thousand books which you can read on site."
