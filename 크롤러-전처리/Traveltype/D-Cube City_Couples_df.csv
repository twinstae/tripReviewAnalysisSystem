0,4.0,"My second time at D-cube city centre hotel Sheraton and it was a night stop. This time round I do find that it is a very beautiful hotel . Convience of shopping centre, food courts n a train station right below. As I had review before the inconvience of having the lobby on the 41st floor and having to change lifts on certain floors to go to the shops. It is very clean, beautiful decor and the staff are very polite , friendly and helpful, I will be staying another nite soon. The things sold there are different from Myeondong n Dondemuan but can always take the train about half an hour. I would rate it a 5 star if I do not have to change lifts!"
1,3.0,"A tacky place. Feels like a fish market but with cloth. Really cheap prices in low end ""designer"" clothing. Don't expect to find a 1k dollars wath in this mall. Scketchi."
