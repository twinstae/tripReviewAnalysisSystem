Its overwhelming so better if you have a list of brands and products you want to save time ."
1,4.0,"A must visit when coming to Seoul.Pros- Spacious walkways as compared to say Taipei's street/night markets. 2) Comestic, fashion and foodstuff for snacking relatively affordable. 3) Easily reached via Seoul Metro Stn of Eujiro 1 ga n Myeongdong.4) Wide range of hotels to suit one's budget arnd the area. Cons-1) Their street food are quite pricey for a night market.Average arnd 3000 won for just about any finger food and taste just about average. 2- Can get lost easily as most places in there looks very similar. Nonetheless, a must visit when travelling to Seoul."
2,3.0,"If you plan on shopping for k-beauty here, make sure you come before 2pm. Once the markets start it gets crazy busy. On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls. There are some decent restaurants around too in the area."
3,5.0,"Amazing cosmetics shopping, many other shops too. Different kinds of street food. Very different and unusual experience."

9,5.0,"I loved the food street there. If you want to find Korean original Cosmetic you better going to Young Lottee shopping(DutyFree). The difference shopping etude product  between Shaila duty free and MeyngDong is the number of things (package)and expired date ( pls check). Of Course the duty free is long than Myeongdong. The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision. I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me.In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an  outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...Korea have a lot type of Cosmetic, pls brows and learn first about the product that you are looking for before it. its save your time.The Food there is amazing. I tried grill Lobster with Mozarela, expensive but worthed.Eggbread is safe for muslim. ignore the fried ""type"". Korean street Seller are friendly  but good sales person(They wont give up until you buy :).)"
10,4.0,Love the street food in this place. There are a lot of variety compared to some markets. Slightly pricey for the food but quite standard throughout the street I.e. no need to look for best price or haggle. It was quite crowded on a weekday night (wednesday) up to 930pm when we left. So can imagine it to be worse during weekends. There are also a lot of bulk discounts for cosmetics. Even though you are not into cosmetics. Can just drop by to eat or soak into the atmosphere!
11,5.0,Had heard so much about this shopping area but what was on display went beyond all that. This is the place for korean beauty products. Lots and lots of street food joints and you will be spoilt for choices. The food looks visually appearing and everything we tried was yummy. The streets are choc a bloc with shoppers and there it is fun to just sit somewhere munching on the food and watch the world go buy. You can spend hours at this place. A must visit if you are in Seoul
12,4.0,"Fun place to wander around at night and stock up on k-beauty supplies. Shop employees will be handing out ‚Äúfree‚Äù sheet masks in exchange for ushering you into the stores and trying to make a sale, so be prepared lol.

Was definitly a great experience walking up and down and seeing all the different vendors, and all the stores behind still open as well"

20,5.0,"Very alive and vibrant area, for me a good place to explore when in Seoul and it‚Äôs best to go there late in the afternoon and in the evening when food stalls are lining in the streets with different varieties of street food.

23,5.0,"This is what we were looking for, an experience of sound, light, food, and aromas that assault your senses. As soon as we began our walk through the area we knew this was the real Seoul we has come to see. Crowded streets filled with pedestrians, flashing neon, and a cornucopia of food to sample and wares to buy. It is something to experience at night or at least early evening, things just get going at dusk. There are all sorts of stores to shop and food to eat, you decide what you want. We just enjoyed taking it all in and strolled the alleys and streets, people watching and observing. I do recommend the fried curly potato on a stick rolled in BBQ seasoning."

28,5.0,We had no idea how much shopping plays in the lives of the Koreans.  This area is like times Square in New York.
29,3.0,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it‚Äôs just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food‚Äôs quite nice if you‚Äôre starving while shopping. That‚Äôs all there is to it.
30,4.0,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists."

46,5.0,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD‚Äôs and other merch for very good prices. If you aren‚Äôt into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)"

48,3.0,"Shops and shops selling the same things..... Some of these shops employ ""rude idiots"" that stand outside the stores with ""fake"" gifts to entice you to go into the stores with no intention of giving you any such gift.

56,5.0,"Myeongdong is a wonderful district to visit with Endless shops and eateries.Lotte, Shinsegae, underground and above ground shopping streets are all in this district.  Many good restaurants on Myeongdong ga-gil waiting for you to explore as well occasionally some street stalls along your way can quench your thirsty or hunger.Myeongdong station is not the correct station for Lotte Duty Free or Lotte Department Store.  Don't be misled by the advertisement in the station. Take the Euljiro-1ga Station is much closer. Use Myeongdong Station exit  6 will bring you right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping streets.  Here is the best place to buy Korea Snacks back home. On Myeongdong 8ga and passing Myeongdong 2-gil but before the main road Sogong-ro, you will find Lotte Mart at your left. The famous Wangjigib BBQ is also here. Lunch special up to 5 pm only 11,000 to 13,000 won. However, Lotte Mart is not the cheapest for Lotte Products. You can check Korea Mart and other shops along Myeongdong 8ga-gil. Promotions of Korea Snacks are plentiful here and sure will cause you over weight.Whilst you already reached Lotte Mart, mind as well go across  Sogong-ro to Shinsegae Duty free and Department store. Since you are on Sogong-ro, at the fork, take Namdaemun-ro North to Lotte Young Plaza and further to Lotte Duty Free and Department Store.You finished off your Myeongdong Shopping Street at Euljiro-1ga station."
57,5.0,"We loved visiting Myeongdong. The tax free shopping is great, there‚Äôs great stationery shops (Art Box... go there) and the beauty scene: there‚Äôs every brand you could want in both standalone and mixed stores. It‚Äôs a must if if you visit Seoul."
58,5.0,"Our apartment rental is right on the edge of this large night market, and we have spent our first two nights wandering through the streets here, just taking it all in. It‚Äôs full of people and awesome little shops and stalls. Just looking down the streets with all the lights and visual clutter makes you want to take a photo every five minutes. There‚Äôs nothing like this in the states!"
59,5.0,"I‚Äôll always pop by myeongdong for food and shopping whenever I‚Äôm in Korea üòÇStreet food are all good but definitely a little pricey as most tourists will pop by here! Overall, I still enjoy coming to myeongdong despite the crowd. It‚Äôs a place where I can get all my shopping done in a day!"
60,4.0,"Walking around in Myeongdong Street Market was an experience for both the pocket and stomach. With lots of street food vendors, this will be a good time filler while waiting for your significant other while they shop.  Personally, my favorite snack was the croissant stall (nutella croissant) this was was only 2500 won (2usd). Another favorite was the pork dumplings (3 huge dumplings) for 3500 won. Surely you wont go hungry while going around the street market.  There are alot of stores as well with alot of varieties (fake supreme shirts, shoes, belts, bags) to retail stores (Uniqlo, ABC mart - sells shoes) this will definitely be good to go around after a long day touring the city.  Stores however close early (between 9pm -10pm). The nice thing about this, you can keep coming back."

If you buy more than $30000, will do the tax free for you immediately. Bring your passport. Enjoyed the environment but can‚Äôt really have a mood to buy stuffs slowly."
64,4.0,"Myeongdong is a signature South Korean shopping district which you will need to visit, whether you are a shopper or not.The side alleys off the Main Street offers many local Korean brands ranging from boutiques, cosmetics, consumer goods, digital equipment etc.This is a area where you see a young Korea in action. The biggest plus point is that the stalls are open till late."
65,5.0,"I totally love this place. It is busy yet you have so much to see. You can find souvenirs, clothes, korean fashion stuffs, food, convenient stores, massage parlour, cosmetics and beauty products stores. Its best to come early (before 1pm) if you want to avoid crowd and the heat. I prefer coming over at night, probably after 630pm, where you have lots of street stalls selling more merchandise and lots of food stuffs. The beauty shops such as Innisfree, Nature Republic and Olive Young is worth a visit as they might have special offers especially if you buy more. This is a long street with many directions to walk about. Just take note of certain stores as landmark for your easy reference. There are some brands which has more than one outlet at the same area. It can get quite crowded at times so pace yourself. A mini usb fan will be helpful... I would recommend this as a must visit especially if you are into shopping, cosmetics and beauty, street food, fashion stuffs and souvenirs."
66,4.0,"Items may be overpriced at street stalls. May help if you do some research on what you want to buy. Can find bargains too. Huge variety of food, clothes and shoes.

72,4.0,Myeondong shopping area is a great place to amble through day or night.  The street food is amazing and incredibly good value for money.
73,3.0,"You can count on a few things in Myeongdong-gil...- skincare stores with employees soliciting outside the store trying to give you a sample- stores and vendors selling knock-off designer bags and accessories - street vendors selling local eats- a ton of Korean restaurants - a ton of convenience stores The downside is all the stores in each category seem to be selling the exact same stuff!  It‚Äôs hard  to distinguish one alleyway from the next because the stores are so redundant.  There‚Äôs literally duplicates of branded stores as well.All to say, Myeongdong-gil is a cool place to visit and shop but gets old after a while.  Make sure you check out a Korean BBQ restaurant ...we really enjoyed them.Strawberries dipped in syrup on a stick was a cool street vendor eat we enjoyed.Check out different foods you find in convenience stores...they‚Äôre all good!  Fishy ice cream sandwich below (not fish flavoured lol)"

77,4.0,"Just around the corner from Lotte department store and Lotte Hotel. Myeongdong shopping street is the most wellknown main shopping area in Seoul, especially for ladies, old and young. Mainly for fashion, lifestyle and beauty. There are many cafes, restaurants too. The most interesting attraction might be the very propular one on instagram : Stylenanda Hotel, so named but actually not a ""hotel"" to stay, but a shop selling cosmetics, fashion clothing with a cafe, all housed in several storeys designed like a hotel and spa. The design concept dominated in pink color is interesting enough to attract younger crowd to go in and browsing around, taking photos and selfies for their instagram posts. At night the whole street is turning into a night market, with food stalls selling all kinds of food, snacks and souvenirs."
78,4.0,"Lots of food and souvenir stalls, and high street shops. Bustle and hustle after 4pm. Be prepared to hunt for bins for your rubbish. We found some next to subway stairs."

We bought a lot of products and they wouldnt give us samples unless we ask for it and even when we did ask they would only give 1 small sample while they would give 10 to 20 samples (yes!) To asian people right next to us who spent half less.... Also when entering no one would come to help us, no hello, no goodbye..Even if prices were good we did not feel welcomed there... Especially at Laneige (such a good reputation oversees but it was the worst, as well as Innisfree). Tony moly and etude house were a little more open to tourists."
81,5.0,"you can settle everything there. foot massage is also available but did not try. full of cosmetic shops (10+10free) masks, sports wear, etc.. nice street stores available too. but you are in for a ‚Äúfight‚Äù especially when there is a sales. and yes, plenty of halal foods for muslim tourists!"

Most historical sites are mostly walking distance or short cab ride away, and authentic Korean restaurants and entertainment venues are also nearby, lots of street foods at night. And every where you go there are always stores selling beauty products, I have never seen so many variations of facial mask until I came to this area, and these products are seems to be the best giveaways to your friends when you go back home..."
85,4.0,"Very crowded in the evening. Good experience authentic smelling street food, that not experience in my home country. Lots of facial masks and facial cosmetics for ladies. Its a ladies world. Different mask products which is sold in discount packaging. Unless u know which product to buy, u will be totally confused. Average price between 1000 to 1500 won per mask. But if u buy like 10 + 10, the cost can be as low as 500 wong. Shop around and get the best price."

87,5.0,"If you love Korean skincare or beauty products, here is the best place to go look and spend your money on it. Cheaper than in your country, all the face mask, night cream, or whatever. Not just one store, but almost all brands are here. Plus, if you start to get hungry, there are a lot of Korean food street here. The price is a bit higher than in other places in Seoul (street food) because Myeon dong has more international tourist than other places. Maybe that's why they put a higher price, but the taste and quality are the same. Just pick the most crowded food stall, they probably sell a tastier one than the other.Most hotel/hostel in Myeondong also have a higher price, I always booked into a different area and go to Myeon-dong via subway. Cheaper and faster.You might want to bring a small suitcase to buy a year worth of face mask here. Lol!"

94,4.0,Stayed around the area..did not manage to walk around the whole place but did get to smell and eat the street food. Wonderful experience. Lots of yummy food to taste on..eg lobster tail with cheese..honeyed strawberry and grape..etc.  A lot of cosmetics ..souvenir shops. It is really a fashion and eat street.  Tried a restaurant which served abalone porridge..chicken buloggi porridge..etc. Yum..porridge served with kimchi..literally everywhere.  Will definitely spend more time there; in future visit.
95,4.0,"This place can get really crowded at times.  There is an over abundance of shops selling woman‚Äôs beauty items.  Many Chinese visitors shopping for everything.  If you look you can find restaurants throughout the area, but many are on the 2nd or 3rd floors.  You get what you pay for.  Some of the more expensive restaurants will come with several side dishes which were so common a decade ago.  Some street food vendors sell, but have no place to set and enjoy what you have just bought.Still a good place to visit,  wear your tennis shoes, bring your camera and have a good time."
96,5.0,"You can find almost whatever you're looking for in these streets as well as Shingsae department store.  Everything from street food to, socks, t-shirts, electronics, supermarkets, desserts, restaurants, etc.Stroll worth the trip."

98,4.0,"This place is for food enthusiast and shoppers. Nice place to shop whilst eating korean specialty crayfish, or an octupus on a stick... lol. We spend around $50 the first nyt and we keep craving for more stuff.. following night we ate at the resto. Kinda busy atmosphere on the street at night. Worth an experience..."
99,4.0,"Face masks, feet masks, hand masks and everything else you need to look and feel great will be found here! There‚Äôs the odd clothing store and some restaurants, but it‚Äôs predominantly cosmetic shops. It‚Äôs hustling and bustling and everything you expect of a major Asian city!"
100,4.0,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund by showing your passports when shopping at some outlets. Conveniently located with Underground shops and subway stations nearby. The beautiful Myeongdong Cathedral also located here."
101,5.0,"There is a lot of creative street foods along the street and the street shop at night time. The night time  is more alive than the day time. There is a lot of Korean cosmetic shops, Korean fashion, and restaurants."
102,5.0,"Facial care and cosmetic enthusiasts , this is for you . Almost any available international and Korean specialty brands can be found here. At cheaper prices at that. In almost every corner you will find something. That‚Äôs aside from several souvenir shops , convenience stores , mini grocery , and stalls selling knock off designer shirts . Street food kiosks sprout from late afternoon. These items are not that basic , selling abalone , scallops , crabs and lobster among others. Choose your fave food , you won‚Äôt be disappointed. But the prices are not cheap.  Yet I loved it. Included some photos ."
103,5.0,"My wife and daughter absolutely loved this shopping district.  The South Korean women take their beauty seriously and this is a dream street for purchasing anything you need to take care of your desires.  The district is chock full of quality stores, the streets are vibrant and clean and there is plenty of street food.Crazy experience when a couple approved me to take a 'selfie' with a Westerner!  Had a great laugh."
104,4.0,Visited myeongdong. Its a paradise. Street food everywhere. Cosmetic product are everywhere and cheap too
105,5.0,"This is by far the best market in Seoul. Street food AMAZING! Shopping INCREDIBLE! We spent a majority of our time exploring this place, WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT!"
106,4.0,Great shopping place for cosmetics & sports wear. Plenty of food outlets and snacks stores. Spoilt with varieties of snacks in these stores. Do shop around for bargains.Stay on for the nite market where St foods is a must try. Do remember to pack warm clothes for the nite mkt(springtime is still cold at nite).If you are looking for F&B outlets do check out on the upper floor signage since the outlets are mostly on 2nd flr.
107,4.0,"It is very busy everyday, full of tourists. Restaurants, beauty shops, street food (evening) every way. Can‚Äôt speak Korean no problems, the sales people can speak English, Chinese & Thai. Try the banana milk if you are in South Korea, is quite popular among tourists. Also try the ginseng chicken soup not bad."
108,5.0,"You can get street food, facial masks, sports apparel here. Zara, H&M, Uniqlo are also located on this shopping street. Lots of promotion for the facial products. Selling one for one - good buy. A must go place in Seoul. The later it gets, the crowded it is so do go earlier to avoid the crowd."
109,5.0,The place seems to have more tourists than locals.  It is a must visit place when coming to Seoul.  Plenty of shops and foods in a street maze.  Easily accessible by train.
110,5.0,"Highlight of our trip! Our hotel, L7 Hotel is very much close to this area so we had no trouble of finding a place to eat! Every night, we tried different food, from grilled cheese clams to fresh strawberries dipped in syrup! Shopping is pretty much covered also, there are a lot of bargain stores you can get snacks for gift-aways for friends! And of course, face masks everywhere!!!!"
111,5.0,This place is the same like we have in the Philippines. It has too many people walking around like divisoria but the only difference is its safety. Food street stalls were clean and delicious. Shopping stalls were great.
112,4.0,This was a great experience and so glad to go . We walked from our hotel in the early evening so many food stands. I highly recommend the lobster with cheese and the deep fried shrimp. We had to go back three times to be able to try lots more. The Oreo cookie churro is good as well. Make sure to take this activity in on your busy.
113,4.0,"Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, skin care products, and clothing.  But the best part I enjoyed here is the row of streetfood that line in the middle of the street, which aren't that expensive.  Great to go here during the late afternoon to evening.  You can easily spend much time and money going around this place and enjoying yourselves."
114,4.0,If you are looking for something you can find it in this area. There were shops and people everywhere.
115,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is one of the best shopping streets in Seoul. There are a wide variety of shops here, including a FILA megastore, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas Originals, Nike, GUESS etc. Asides from many clothing stores, there are also many face care and make-up stores which have very good deals. Innis free, Etude House, 3CE, and Tony Moly are some of the many make-up/face care brands which have more than 3 stores at Myeongdong.There‚Äôs also a ton of street food along the streets of Myeongdong. The prices of the street food range from 1,000KRW to 8,000KRW. There‚Äôs roasted cheesy lobster, butter shrimp, Oreo churros, Korean fishcakes etc."
116,5.0,"If you‚Äôre into street food, shopping, large crowds, high energy, or traveling with no kids, Myeongdong will suit your needs. If not, you might be overwhelmed and I don‚Äôt recommend this destination. This area is filled with tourist crowds all battling for the delicious street food. Each food vendor are $5 to $10 that varies from deserts to seared scallops. If the food vendors doesn‚Äôt hit your wallet, the multilple storefronts will. Want to shop for sneakers, clothes, beatufy face masks, or color contacts? This area will serve your shopaholic needs. Bear in mind, this place is very touristy."
117,4.0,"From street food to shopping , you can get it all there. It‚Äôs mostly crowded with people. It‚Äôs a good place to shop for mask, hand cream and etc."
118,5.0,"You decide why you will visit Myeongdong but whatever your reason may be, this is a must place to see in Seoul.Yes, it is crowded but this adds to the vibe of the place. This is also very accessible via the subway line."
119,5.0,"If you are a food lover, you must check this place out. The vendors starts setting up around 3-4pm and it‚Äôs open until around 10pm. There‚Äôs also a lot of stores to shop around."
120,5.0,"When I arrive at this place, I have money in my wallet. By the time I left I am so much poorer but my wife is very happy"
121,4.0,"This place was bustling with people at the night we visited. The crowds went for shopping ( cosmetics, souvenirs,etc) , food ( Koreans n international) and entertainment ( theatre, pubs n karaokes).This place is near metro station and is very accessible, a must for all visitors who want to feel the busy pulse of Korea in the evenings."
122,5.0,This street is brilliant with so much excitement . It‚Äôs a must see during your visit especially at night .
123,5.0,"This place is very good to shop but a bit touristy . If you don‚Äôt mind it, it is very good and you can get everything there."
124,5.0,"You can get all your traditional korean food and snacks here. Rows of make-up and skincare products boutiques. They have big supermarket there too, where you can buy local snacks souvenirs. If you want proper restaurants, they have it there too."
125,5.0,"Great street market that is located steps away from downtown Seoul.  There is so much here that it‚Äôs hard to sum it all up.Face masks?  You will get ‚Äúpushed‚Äù face masks by almost every shop.  Actually gets annoying after a while, but heck...we bought 100 face masks.  Our faces better be silky smooth :)So much food options!  You‚Äôll have a great time trying the different vendors or restaurants in Myeongdong.  We tried tons of different places and all were very tasty...not one bad experience.This is for sure an experience you won‚Äôt want to miss!  Happy travels!"
126,4.0,"We last visited Myeongdong four years ago, in summer, with an adult daughter in tow, who wanted to visit seemingly every single outlet on the street - an interesting but rather exhausting experience.This time around, in much less busy February and with no pressure to buy anything specific, we found it a much more enjoyable experience, just ambling along and watching life going on all around us.  There is every conceivable cosmetic store here, sometimes multiple branches just a few hundred meters from each other - just in case they don‚Äôt tempt you in the first time - interleaved with fashion stores, shoe stores and sportswear mainly.Many of the stores have ‚ÄòGreeters‚Äô outside, whose job it is to persuade you in. There are also lots of people with flyers for such things as massages, cat cafes etc, which are located just offering the main shopping streets. You do need to adopt a firm stance.There are lots of good offers on cosmetics, which are of high quality in Korea. Many stores will give you samples too although, as an ‚ÄòAajuma‚Äô who clearly doesn‚Äôt wear make up, I don‚Äôt seem to fit the criteria, or perhaps I just didn‚Äôt spend enough! When we were here with our daughter she almost had more samples than purchased goods.Obviously the character of the shops within these streets are aimed at particular tastes and interests but, even if you aren‚Äôt specifically going to buy something, this is a uniquely Korean experience, and you might just find something that you had no idea you needed."
127,5.0,We took a few hours out to walk the district. Thete is a wide variety of great street food to enjoy and many and varied shopping outlets too. There was a throng of tourists from all over the world this night. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and highly recommend this activity.
128,4.0,A great shopping area and plenty of restaurants. A nice walk pedestrians of shopping haven in Seoul. Must visit.
129,4.0,"Some similar shops around all selling cosmetics and shoes. The night market have many interesting food. I love to get earrings there, they are super cheap and beautiful."
130,5.0,"We came here during the evening after walking down from the Namsan Tower. The market becomes super lively during the evening with lots of food stalls (similar to those found in Taiwan). The Koreans love their weird and wacky food market items, You'll find something for everyone. If you get a chance - try the mini octopi and the dumplings!Here you will also find lots of 'discount'  snack food shops. They are all basically priced the same along the street and all sell the same things. However we did notice later on some of the snacks were being sold at cheaper prices in just a regular supermarket so they might actually be tourist traps! Though - you really can't fault them for their variety!Lots of options for dinner in the area too if you want a sit down meal and also really close to the Lotte mall!"
131,5.0,Great place to try different Korean style street foods.  Such a lively location with several sneaker and cosmetic stores.  Have also tried a few nearby restaurants.
132,4.0,"Bustling, lots to see and buy. The street food is good and worth trying. You can snack along the way instead of dinner. There are plenty of shops: cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc, as well as plenty of outdoor stalls with gifts, clothes...."
133,5.0,Definitely a must visit! The FOOD ARE AMAZING! Shopping is great too! Their sport shoes and sneakers are cheaper compared to other asian countries :)
134,5.0,Lots of shops for every taste and wallet. Nice street food at the end in the evenings. Highly recommend!
135,5.0,"If you‚Äôre into cosmetics and beauty products, you have to go to this place and you won‚Äôt probably finish the whole area in just one night. Too many shops offering different prices of the same product. Sellers offering freebies for you to enter their shops. You can find good deals when shops are on sale but that means you really have to spend time going into each store. So far the most common stores I saw in literally every street are, aritaum, skinfood, artbox, too cool for school, innisfree, clio, nature republic, banila co., and tony molly. I‚Äôm sure I miss a lot but really with that many cosmetic shops, I‚Äôm lucky I can still remember a few!üòÇ There are also good street food but not a lot. Myeongdong is very accessible, there‚Äôs an MRT that goes straight into the market. If you know how to find your way through Seoul‚Äôs MRT then it‚Äôs really easy to find places in Seoul. I‚Äôm so used to taking MRT here in Taiwan so Seoul was no problem for me.I would recommend anyone visiting Seoul to visit Myeongdong just to experience the cosmetic culture of Korea."
136,5.0,"There are many people everyday at Myeongdong Shopping street but on weekends, people flock the shopping area for freebies and discounts. I bought so many buy 1 take 1 masks ad make up on a Saturday! The street has full of activities - shopping, street food eating and light show (Christmas season). It may really get cold during winter however... A must see when in Seoul!"
137,2.0,"Myeongdong is known to be cosmetic haven for tourists with most beauty brands having a shop presence and good discounts. Even MCM has a two-storey flagship store there and you can also buy all sorts of snacks/ tidbits from the Korean marts to bring home. 200% in terms of convenience. However, be forewarned. Sales people in the cosmetic shops are very very pushy, not only do they follow you ard, they also try to upsell at every opportunity. In addition, the street food carts do not have displayed prices (I only found out later that this is not the norm after visiting areas like Gangnam & Hongdae where prices are clearly displayed). I am not sure if I was ‚Äúcheated‚Äù, I was charged 5,000 won for a stick of fish cake where it is sold at 2,000 won max at other areas. You are better off eating in the many small eateries/ restaurants in the area."
138,3.0,"Stayed away from this place if you don‚Äôt like shopping or seeing/being in the sea of people. This is the makeup shopping mecca for tourists visiting South Korea. This shopping street reminded me of shopping malls on Black Friday. There are deals everywhere and ones can get easily overwhelmed. Even when you come in with a specific items to purchase at the makeup store, the sales people will keep trying to persuade you to spend more money at the store by selling bulk items at cheaper price. Sales people will walk with you closely as you browse at the store and it can be an uncomfortable experience. There are plenty of food vendors on the street as well. If you‚Äôre health conscious, I can tell you that you won‚Äôt find any healthy options because all the offerings are similar to county fair food types. Come here at least once to get the experience."
139,5.0,"We got off namsan tower and went to myungdong. the weather was very cold. We came here for decades, wanted to have warm meal. but we could not find a restaurant. we finally met the staff who showed we the place and fund the restaurant location.  there was a restaurant in the nearby alley. we warmed body because we ate warm sullung-tang. myung-dong is still the center of seoul."
140,4.0,"This is a must visit for all visitors and tourists in Seoul. Honestly I don't understand why many people visited this place for products, food and souvenirs. Despite there are many street foods areas in MyeongDong, please be sure that they are all selling the same types of Korean foods. That's why I am confused what is the attractions in MyeongDong."
141,5.0,A heaven for ladies to shop! Wide range of beauty products and clothing for ladies and men. This is a shopping heaven!
142,1.0,"Why would you shop in Korea? Sure you can get Korean cosmetics, but everything else is way over priced because of the taxes. It's a known fact."
143,5.0,"Heaven for the ladies! Street shopping, you can get everything you need here. For skin products enthusiast this street is a must, and your partners can enjoy the foodstreet."
144,5.0,"I would list in my must-go place. The area has lots of cosmetic shops, clothings, discount food marts and plenty of street food. I came here a tad early at 12 plus in the afternoon. Most of the street vendors hadn‚Äôt set up their stalls. The advantage was that a much smaller crowd in popular shops such as the Line Bear; where there‚Äôs a giant one-half storey tall bear available for free photo taking. This area also has cat cafe and a good selection of restaurants, coffee cafes. By 4pm, the area was filled with people and most of the streets stall are out in full force. The atmosphere is very different from Hongik University street which is also worthy of a visit!"
145,5.0,"This whole street is a taste of what Seoul really is. Full of cosmetics shops and street food, it was one of my favorites during my visit. You really feel in Korea!"
146,5.0,Great place to shop and for dining. There are plenty shops for any products. Try the street food stalls. It‚Äôs always crowded though.
147,5.0,"Really enjoyed our visit here and fantastic if you are into shopping. Also so many street vendors so go hungry! A great experience, would recommend."
148,3.0,Crowded place. You must know what you want to get from here and stay focus on your objective. A lot of small lane have similar shops. Always ask for sample if you are buying cosmetic items. A lot of street food but too crowded to stay around and eat.
149,5.0,A must visit if you come to Seoul. Abundance of street food & also Korean skincare products. I was in heaven! üòÇ
150,4.0,"Worth a visit for the street food and shopping options. There's a huge Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and MCM store, along with multiple branches of k beauty stores, offering discounts and duty free shopping."
151,3.0,"Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me. During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier. I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heck,....I am a guy. I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there. You don't like the price, goes elsewhere. Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey. Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15,000 won which is between $13 to $15 US. But what the heck is cheese on it for???? I would rather have had butter!"
152,4.0,"Years has past since my last visit in 2014 & before that but Myeongdong still remain a great attraction, great shopping street & a local food street at nite, full of tourists full of noise full of ambience...Like best still the food stalls at nite, u will definitely find something nice. Tried quite a few - Korean fish cake, grill prawn, fruit juice, chestnut, Gimbap etc lots of varieties. It's freezing in Dec so the food stalls really warm up your tummy!Great to stay near Myeongdong, so convenient to subway, airport shuttle bus stop, bakery for breakfast, restaurants, departmemt store (run out of time to revisit) ....& Rolling Pin, found this nice bakery near to exit 5 or 6 of Euljiro 1 station on way to hotel, it's quietly at a corner. We had our breakfast there every morning after we found it, the bread is so nice, great coffee & ambience! If u have limited time in Seoul & want to experience nite shopping street with local food stalls, Myeongdong is the place!"
153,4.0,"I would recommend visiting this street towards the evening when the streets get closed to vehicular traffic and instead get lined up with apparel, accessories, souvenir shops and food stalls serving myriad Korean dishes from seafood to sugary savoury delights.For those of you who want to haggle on prices, good luck with that since the shopkeepers here have a union of sorts where they don't charge any less than the price marked. To that end, the prices here are already very competitive and hence bargaining isn't really needed. For those of you who would still love to bargain, should head to the nearby Myeong-dong Underground Shopping center where the shopkeepers are more willing for some bargaining.Expert Tip: For beating harsh Seoul winter weather, going Underground will be a much more comfortable stroll in the endless matrix of alleys."
154,5.0,"Our hotel was just at the end of the Myeongdong shopping street, which was PERFECT for a nightly stroll through all the stalls and snacking.  Every night we selected our favorite delicious Korean treats for a late-night snack.  Favorite Snacks:* Korean pancake with honey and cinnamon inside..mmmm...* Kimchee dumplings* Lobster (Pricey at USD$15, but so worth it!)* Shrimp and butter....yum* Egg on bread (bread was more like cornbread.  simple snack)* Spiral potatoesIf you like congee, you've got to try the Congee House at the end of the street (31 Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Chungmuro 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul,) The abalone congee is to die for!  We ordered the ""take out"" and it was packaged so well."
155,5.0,"MSS has got everything you need covered, from cosmetics to street food. The vibe during the day and night are definitely different. I spent the whole day here and still haven't finished shopping (haha). The guides wearing red are located at the entrance of the shopping street so do sought out their help. Sock shopping is best done in Myeongdong. In my experience, exchange rate is highest in Myeongdong, particularly the one inside Migliore."
156,5.0,"If you are looking to spend your hearts out, come to myeondong street to shop. Big brands boutiques on sales which can go as low as 70%."
157,4.0,"Just walking around is fun. Of course, shopping and eating makes it even more fun!I like Myung In Mandoo, because I can sit down to eat in peace at street food prices."
158,4.0,"The place is great for shopping. Big discounts are offered by various merchants. Street foods are delicious, but a little bit expensive. If it is your first time to Myeongdong, make sure that you bring a map with you. Same business establishments appear in different streets. There is no public toilet with in the area. You have to enter in a coffee shop or dine just to use their toilet. Definitely this will cost you."
159,3.0,"the first time was great, all the food seemed tantalizing and yummy, shops all around abound with goods, as well as the ubiquitous korean beauty products.the second time, we explored more of the alleyways connected with the main shopping row, thinking we might discover something new, did not happen.  food stalls sell basically more of the same: hotdog with batter, fish cake, skewers, cheese lobster, fruit juices, milk tea, crepe, twisted potato, strawberry chocolates, egg bread, and cheese clam.even the stores are repetitive: ABC Mart, Innisfree, Oliver Young, Lesmore... it got stale and boring pretty fast.there are a few gems like Mother's Touch which sells mainly fried chicken and maaan so goooood. they're located on the 5th floor of a secluded building which you will miss if you stick to the middle of the road.basically it's one big tourist trap.  visit it once just so you can say you've visited. come back if you forgot something, other than that, it's an expensive and crowded place."
160,4.0,Myeongdong Shopping street is very easily accessible from City Hall as well as my train. There are several subway entrances to the main street. The Subway is well marked in English.Besides the usual shopping some of my recommendations are as under: 1. Visit this Street during the weekends - it's phenomenal 2. Don't just check out the shops at the ground level but also look out for good restaurants and shops on Level 1 & 23. Sample all the street food available on the street especially the local bun and egg baked and the prawns cooked in tempura.4. They have a huge contact lens market with  plethora of color options.Hint: jus go empty handed as you can really shop a lot.
161,4.0,"I heard a lot about Myeongdong before my trip, not knowing what to expect until I visied the place for the first time.  Lots of shops, especially skin care products. The pricing is cheaper than my country. Must buy facial masks,  very cheap. This place turns alive in the evening when the people pushes out the street cart and it becomes food street. Tasted a few,  not bad but not fantastic. Good for experience but I won't eat again. It is a tourist place."
162,3.0,The price moderate. Difficult to communicate. Crowded at night but a lot of things we can see and buy. The environment nice and clean.
163,5.0,Korean shopping at Myeongdong is a totally different experience than that of other cities! The Koreans are very accomodating and friendly and they give so many freebies when you purchase an item. Most of the items are negotiable so its good! And they are very honest in doing tax refund which is ‚Äúunheard of‚Äù in some countries! A great experience for sure!!
164,5.0,"Needless to say, Meyongdong is a shopper's heaven. Husband and I did, what's called a 'K-haul' from here and Hongdae. Best beauty brands have multiple outlets. We spent a lot of time at Olive Young, a drug store where you can find most brands! Innisfree, Cosrx (at Aland), Tony Moly, Etude House, Missha, The Face Shop are among the countless beauty brands we shopped for.We got there early the first time and spent almost the whole day, taking food and drink breaks and dropping shopping bags to our Airbnb which was only one station away. The area starts to get alive only after 6pm though. Lot's of vendors come out on the streets and the crowd starts to get thicker. A lot of shops don't open till 10 am so no point getting here too early."
165,3.0,"The streetfood is definitely overpriced. And the stalls are repeated, so you see different people selling similar food items in the whole stretch. With the amount of money we spent on streetfood, we could have had a decent meal in a proper restaurant."
166,5.0,"Definitely an active shopping experience, not for agorophobics. Shops of all kinds and sizes are side by side on narrow streets with colorful sings and throngs of people.  Clothes, cosmetics, knick knacks, food, brand names and unknown brands are on display."
167,5.0,"Nice place. Interesting experience and good street food. Went for the second time in 2018, first in 2017."
168,3.0,"First of all, I know it‚Äôd be crowded cause it‚Äôs a tourist area, which isn‚Äôt the issue. The problem I had mainly was the entire shopping street was just the same stores over and over again spread out. Like 6 Tony Moly, Etude House, Clio, etc makeup brands store just scattered throughout the street. So it‚Äôs not like the entire street is different, it‚Äôs like the same stores. Kind of overrated."
169,4.0,"This place just shouts BUY ME. The streets are literally lined with shops! All the cosmetics, clothes, and great food! What's more, there are guides posted in specific areas where you can ask questions. We asked what food would be good to eat and what restaurant. They give you a map which is veeeery helpful too."
170,4.0,"Tons of shop selling skin care product, clothes and restaurant. Street food cart normally start operating on late afternoon. The place can get real crowded especially at night and weekend. One stop paradise for those who likes to shop and eat."
171,5.0,Now this place takes markets to a different level it is spread out over a few blocks and it‚Äôs has just about everything from fresh produce to led lighting and some great food stalls try the mungbean fritters their great and you don‚Äôt get hassled their are also information people here and around certain parts of the city dressed up in red outfits to help you
172,5.0,"This is every woman's paradise when it comes to make up and beauty product shops and clothing as well. Every where you turn there is a shop for you. Lets not forget the street food, you must try all they have to offer. From potato tornado to baked cheesy scallops. Every travellers must visit in Korea"
173,4.0,We stopped here after Insa-dong and it was much busier but the shopping did not disappoint. Some of the souvenirs are a little more expensive than Insa-dong but a lot is comparable. This place gets pretty busy with cars driving through crowds of people. The street food is amazing! Definitely worth stopping to!
174,3.0,Our hotel was about 1km so we walked easily to this location. Went twice in 10 days. We felt that one walk through was adequate.
175,4.0,Nobody does street shopping better than Asia and the Myeongdong was not exception.  And the big plus is that the shop owners and shoppers are very considerate (with the exception of a few ugly tourists).  And at night the place really lights up - don‚Äôt miss the experience.
176,5.0,The best of korean street food can be found just as you stroll around the streets of myeondong shopping market at night.
177,3.0,The best place you should go if you looking to buy cosmetic and enjoying the Seoul best cosmetic company.
178,5.0,"A must visit place. The whole Myeongdong area is huge. There are boutique shops, restaurants, coffee shops, dessert places and more in the whole area!"
179,4.0,"Plenty of streetfood, some are a bit more expensive than stalls you find near the university precincts."
180,4.0,"We came here to visit the big UNIQLO store, which was great. There are heaps of other shopping options. There's a subway station right in the heart of the area, lots of street food and good pedestrian areas, so it's certainly a shoppers paradise. We came at about midday and it wasn't crowded yet."
181,5.0,"Near to myeong dong train station. Always fill with people, tourists and locals. Many different street food available. Together with many cosmetics shops nearby. Great place to kill time."
182,5.0,"Our hotel was just at the end of this street, Amazing food and stalls. So much variety you can wander and try things for hours. Everything was clean all the vendors had fresh clean equipment and produce.There is a police station close and tourist police if you need them.It felt very very safe walking around at anytime and there are volunteers who speak English to assist if you need.Most vendors had a little English and we could make do with buying.If your in Seoul don‚Äôt miss out"
183,5.0,"One of our most amazing travel experience! The street becomes more alive around 4-5pm. Locals and Tourist conglomerate in the area for some shopping and or a taste of probably the best street foods! This is a must if you visit Seoul. Very diverse shopping with all the skin care products ( be careful not to get sucked in when they dangle a carrot to enter their stores), high end shopping, street cart shopping, luxury, knock- offs and best of all the array of very innovative food from Pajeon (Korean pancake), Gimbap, dumplings, rice cakes, barbecues on a skewer, egg bread, spiral potatoes, lobster with cheese and many more.... just packaged or handed to you with delight! Just go and experience it!"
184,3.0,Okay shopping. It seems there are at least four of every store in the relatively small/short shopping area.
185,4.0,"Stayed for 2 weeks near the Myeongdong Shipping street. We only made one purchase (mostly b/c we still had 3 more months of travel ahead of us and didn't want to carry the  extra weight around). Is a great place to visit for all sorts of shopping, especially K-beauty. There are literally 3-4 storefronts for the same beauty shops scattered throughout the shopping district, so its easy to get lost. Make sure you have the Naver app to help you navigate the small streets."
186,4.0,"The usual bustling of night markets can be found here. All types of Korean and top brand products can be found.The food stalls line the streets as you walk by, be brave enough to try  a bite when passing the food stalls it is a must when there.Lots of facial products and other cosmetics for the ladies.A must visit when in the area."
187,5.0,"There are 1000's of shops in the area. from reasonably priced to expensive.Name it ,it is there. On the weekends the streets transform into a night food market. I'm sure there were over 500 food stalls. If you are there over the weekend ...you must do it.."
188,2.0,"Mostly all kinds of cosmetics and skincare products. Apart from this  some shops employed very rude sales girls. When they try to speak to you in mandarin and you could'nt understand they will turn you away and also if you don't buy from them, they will snatch back the gifts from you !"
189,5.0,"Sure, there is plenty of shopping to be done on the myriad of alleys and carts and small shops, but I'm going back again tomorrow night for the food.  If you are a lover of street food, meat-on-a-stick and anything that can be fried or torched (see the pic), this is the place.  Plenty of mom/pop/solo carts and, in the easily missed alleys within the alleys, are innumerable places to eat locally.  The skewered dishes we had this even were in the 2000-4000 Korean Won range, making the evening greatly entertaining and a great value."
190,4.0,"These streets (there‚Äôs one main street with smaller ones off to the sides) were close to the hotel and we strolled around one evening, browsing the many cosmetic, make up and health shops, boutiques and sports shops. The area was buzzing with people and it had a lively atmosphere. A great place if you are looking for niche Korean brands; you‚Äôll definitely find them here."
191,5.0,Everything you could be looking for can be found in these markets. Stall holders are willing to barter for the best price. Food is freshly cooked while you wait. Amazing experience
192,5.0,"We took a taxi to Myeongdong and since it's in the center of Seoul it did't take long to get there.  The shopping begins the second you get out of the taxi and doesn't stop until your purchases become to cumbersome to handle.  There is so much to see, so many things for sale.  There are plenty of interesting food stalls with many different varieties of snacks and drinks.  The collage of sights is fantastic and a photographers dream.  Don't miss this attraction."
193,4.0,The street never sleeps in S-town. Here is the paradise for the tourists and locals to do shopping and eat street food and modern snacks.
194,3.0,Lots of shops but none have anything special. I would rather shop at home. Why would you want Turkish items inKorea. Nice place for a stroll but we did not buy anything.
195,4.0,"We stayed close to Myeondong so passed through the main shopping street plenty of times during our stay and regardless of the time of day it was busy. It's easy enough to get disoriented especially if you are looking for somewhere listed in Korean (try using photos in TA listings or google streetview instead). There are plenty of shops to spend your money in (particularly cosmetics/beauty stores) including large  fashion stores such as Muji. You'll also come across a number of street stall selling fashion items, and there is a vast array of street food on offer, so make sure you do try a few as they will suprise you as they are superb. It's a great place to observe local life."
196,4.0,"this is very vibrant. Good area to shop around, cosmetics, clothings, shoes,street food, restaurants, cafe and etc. The place is crowded with people. From here you can also take the underground passage way to Lotte duty free shop."
197,4.0,"Best place to shop in Seoul. Food, clothes, shoes, accessories, toys, cosmetics, souvenirs almost everything can be bought there. If you are a fan of Korean skin care products then this is the place for you. You can also find many number of money changing shops. Quick Tip: 1.

199,5.0,"I spent every evening here with ample dining selections and so much happening, sales in every corner of the street.Don't missed out this area if you are shopping for all K-cosmetic, clothings, shoes, etc. You can claim tax refund in Myeongdong for purchase value of 30,000 won."
200,5.0,"It's a fantastic feelings to be visiting Seoul this time of the year.First week of October is probably the best time to visit. Weather is nice and cool without being too extreme. This is probably the best and relaxing trip. Seoul is the place to be if you enjoy shopping and eating. They have street food for your in between bites. Fantastic choice of BBQ restaurants to choose from. We are staying at the Grand Hotel near the Miyeongdon station. The rooms are nice and clean. The amenities are great. The location is just within walking distance of the shopping belt. You couldn't ask for more. Too bad , when you are having fun, it's time for us to depart for home.Goodbye Seoul and see you real soon.CheersBarry"
201,4.0,"Arrived at the area around 11 am , was wondering what was all the fuss about. By noon droves of people started appearing within an hour place was jammed packed. There are more stores selling cosmetics and skin products than anywhere I have ever seen . Every 3rd or 4th store was selling skin products.Food carts and hawkers started appearing on the streets. Literally every street had at least 8 to 10 Restaurants .Must for any visitor to be here."
202,4.0,Visited it in late evening. Shopping was great. Street foods were great. But we still expect to see more.
203,4.0,"I am not a shopper but enjoyed looking at the wares.  I think Myeongdong Shopping Street had the most food vendors than any of the other street markets and the food was delicious.  We loved the Hottoek, grilled shrimp, pork on a stick... actually, loved everything we ate there."
204,4.0,"Some nice shopping to be had here, lots of cosmetics, but be sure to hang around till 5pm,, when all the street food vendors fill the streets! Delicious, authentic Korean food and delicacies cooked on the street. Yum!"
205,5.0,Tourist hideout...Retail therapy HQ... Full of Chinese tourist but you will get what you need for fashion and beauty items ...Food is in abundance too
206,5.0,"Loved walking up and down the streets sampling the delicious street food.  It seemed reasonable to me.  The honey garlic shrimp was amazing, also the chicken, shrimp and cheese bowls.  Lots of people so very crowded."
207,4.0,Myeong-dong is a pretty touristy spot but also perfect for shopping. There are department stores as well as small stalls with local food or souvenirs.The mix is pretty nice and even though it‚Äôs very crowded it‚Äôs not hectic at all.We liked it there a lot.
208,5.0,"Get your street food fix at the alleys of Myeongdong. Lots of food and dessert options around. Prices can be a little bit higher as this is a touristy area. Tons of roadshop brands here, too. Don't forget to bring your passport so that you can avail of the tax refund (for a minimum single receipt purchase of 30,000 won). Also, I found that Myeongdong is the best place to exchange foreign currency. There is a currency exchange shop near the Chinese Embassy that has particulary good forex rates. From the embassy, walk 20-30 steps along Namdaemun and look for a shop located at a basement (not the one right across)."
209,5.0,Myeondong is just fantastic to walk around with street stalls crazy shopping of all kind. Just love it!
210,4.0,"We were in an apartment very close to the market. Very easy to access and on Friday full of life. We went on Saturday and closing at 23:00 so be careful. You can walk and smell and taste a lot of street food. Need cash for this. Everything is between 2.000 and 5.000 KRW, except the lobster 15.000 KRW.Try also the 32cms ice creams at 2.000 KRW.In one of the streets, you also have a Cat Cafe where an admission fee is required (KRW 10.000) with a drink included. It is an experience ."
211,4.0,"This place is a must see if you want to experience cosmetic/beauty shopping on Korea.The shopping streets are filled with various beauty shops, all offering 50% off or buy one get one free on skincare products, especially face masks.They even have suitcases you can buy at the till if you want to buy a lot of stuff.They all try and get you into the shop by offering you a free face mask.The face mask they give you for free, is being sold for approx 10000 won inside the shop. Once you take this mask, the shop assistants inside follow you around like a lost dog. It is a good experience, you just need to be clear as to how much you want to spend because it can get a bit out of hand as there is so much to choose from!Otherwise on the street, there are the general shops: Zara, H&M, a very cheap pharmacy, restaurants etc.Taxis are also plentiful in this area, and are very very cheap."
212,5.0,"In my view, Myeongdong is the must-visit place for the hundreds of restaurants, shops and night market stalls spread across 99 HA of land. From the exit of Myeongdong station, one must remember the route taken, not so much as not to be lost, but to explore every nick and hook of this shopping paradise in Seoul.Street food served by night market stalls is expensive but not unaffordable. This is after all a popular and famous tourist spot. One advice is not to gobble up every food that intrigues you so that you won't regret not having any more capacity for delicacies 1 hour later.The streets are straight and they criss cross one another. Many shops are duplicated selling cosmetics and skincare products, worth a buy since they are generally half the price compared to the home country of the tourists.Myeongdong - one day is definitely not enough."
213,4.0,"A must see and experience if you love shopping, meandering and people watching.  Street food is good too!"
214,5.0,"Check it out, and you will like it! There are ton of shops, restaurants, and shops..and many more. At night, this place was so lively....small food kiosks showed up...Check it out!"
215,5.0,Just bring along cash to shop till you drop. Wonderful place to get all the Korean drama gadgets here. Most of the shops are managed by young Korean.
216,5.0,We loved this district on our short stay over in Seoul. The street food was to die for! It‚Äôs easily accessible by the metro.
217,4.0,We booked a hotel in this area so that we can make the most out of exploring every nook and cranny of Myeongdong shopping street. There are a lot of tourists and can be overwhelming especially on weekends. But the shopkeepers are nice and there are a lot of things to see (and eat).
218,5.0,"Busy, lively, interesting, good bargains!You can find anything here from a hairdressers to a school books store, big brands and no brands. Total fun mix of people and shops!"
219,5.0,"Shoes, clothes, skin care, toys almost everything is here x3! Many stores u  wont often see in malls."
220,5.0,"Great place to kill the time and everything there looks so attractive. Nice place to shop around. Also, they have some nice restaurants nearby, just google them."
221,5.0,"I think personally when shopping here must be smart to see promotional programs. as most of Etude's brand examples, have many stores and are located in every aisle. do not rush shopping. I have experience when cosmetic shopping in myeongdong, it turns out the price is more expensive than in the online shop. so we have to be smart in shopping"
222,4.0,A very busy street market with a lot checking out food & other items. Little shops & restaurants dotted the streets. Get a sense of the local food etc.
223,4.0,Street market from clothes to accessories to food to gadgets! A must visit but only once if you in Seoul.
224,5.0,Busy streets with plenty shops. You can find everything you want including cosmetic and gifts. Many restaurants there which provide various local food. Also some money exchange shops give very best price for you. Don't miss it!
225,5.0,The shopping is plentiful with many clothing and cosmetic stores. You can get free face mask samples if you look through the stores for a few minutes. During the day it‚Äôs pretty normal streets and stores but at night all the street food carts come out with really tasty and traditional foods for only a few dollars each. Most vendors speak English or get by with pointing. Many sit down restaurants are located on the 2nd floor or higher so don‚Äôt forget to look up. It‚Äôs very safe area and gets busy but not overly crowded. Accessible by the metro train.
226,4.0,Stayed at Myeongdong both 2 years ago and on our last trip. It's a great base to be as it's so lively and happening. There are also a few exchange places so very convenient. I am not big on shopping so wasn't interested in the cosmetic shops and the street food is quite samey and overpriced. The best thing about it is the vibe and convenience in getting to other places- the cable car to Namsan park is not too far away and it's a short walk to Namdaemun. It was nice to step out of our guesthouses and step straight into the energy of the area!
227,4.0,"You can shop here day or night, fashion, name brand Korean cosmetic, shoes, plus many other surprise things to find, if you get hungry, there are many street food stands here, grill lobster tails, grill scallop, bar-b-que beef and shrimp on a stick, fresh fruits and juice, plus many other goodies to enjoy, to shop and to eat or just looking, sure be a fun evening to experience."
228,5.0,"A variety of small shops as well large retail shops the likes of Zara, H&M, Spao, Uniqlo, Forever 21. interspersed between them are food and market stalls. You can choose from a variety of cheap as well expensive stuff. A whole galore of cosmetics shops selling good quality korean cosmetics.Lots of restaurants offering authentic korean foods - BBQ, bibimbap, Galbi, Gimbap and many enticing looking foods at reasonable price. Easy to get to - Myeodong station on the blue line. Nearby departmental store Lotte is just across the road. You can also walk to the nearby Namdaemun market which is about 25-30 mins away. You can a whole day there and still have more to shop the next day."
229,5.0,"üëåüèº Here, even if you pass by the store the salesperson will give you 1 face mask or free facial product sample. I was actually not intended to purchase skincare. But, end up I got offered at Holika Holika for a good price for caviar facial set. Tips to bargain, remember to ask for promotion as they don't tell you unless you ask ü§® Street foods are generally clean, reasonable and delicious. It's a vibrant place especially at night. BTW, before we hit the shopping heaven I managed to stop by at the cathedral for prayer."
230,5.0,"Cosmetics haven for the interested. Many roadside stalls selling street food, bags, accessories etc. Many restaurants and cafes too. Isaac toast and Nanta theater nearby. A great place to hang out and chill if you like crowds."
231,5.0,Very crowded but amazing and a must do in Seoul.you will definitely enjoy especially at night.also a very good place to test the various foods and beautifully designed fruit trolies. There are also some skin care stores where you can buy face masks with reasonable prices and bonus gifts.
232,5.0,"A lot of food vendors at night. Great for shopping, H&M, Forever 21, Adidas, a lot of stores for beauty product (which stay open very late). Couple of bars around. Overall a chill place to walk around and taste the different foods and do a little shopping."
233,4.0,"About shopping, it's a typical shopping street with typical fashion shops. However, there are a lot of food stalls with delicious street food as well as restaurant with local food. Highly recommend to come here for eating instead of shopping"
234,3.0,"Like any other big city, the shopping district can be a rather interesting experience and the Myeongdong area in Seoul is not different. In my opinion, this is nothing special - there's a ton of people and stores selling everything between heaven and earth, most of which seem like rubbish quality. In terms of safety, Korea in general is a plus. Not at one time, did we fear anything and even when crowded, it's a safe place."
235,5.0,"I have been to multiple international shopping zones in my 50+ years of traveling... this is incredible for the diversity of vendors, bargains, and products..  the ability to negotiate is crucial to having an awesome time...  this is your prime location in South Korea  make sure your shoes are comfortable and that you are prepared for wonderful options.."
236,5.0,My husband and I decided to stay in Myeongdong and we loved it. At night the streets  are full of street food and the shops open till late. Best place to shop for cosmetics and face products. A few of the shops are actually tax free too.Do not forget to buy the cute Korean socks for cheap. I also enjoyed the  Korean fried chicken street where you have a range of chain restaurants specialised only in Korean fried chicken and beer.
237,5.0,"My 2nd time in Seoul and Myeongdong is still a very busy and crowded shopping street. You can find many beauty products here and they are cheap! Look for this one shop that sells all brands, it is cheaper than most places!"
238,4.0,Lots of cosmetics store along the street good for women to shop. And at night time lots of food vendor with good food to try.
239,5.0,"Lots of interesting street food ranging from Turkish ice cream to all sorts of Korean delicacies, the while Myeongdong area is a street food and shopping paradise (particularly for the ladies interested inKorean cosmetics). Very busy till after eleven but still manageable crowds in early June; could imagine things getting a bit out of hand at peak season or when Chinese tourists return in force. Spent a couple of enjoyable evenings there!"
240,4.0,"Must visit for all beauty lovers. Even if you're not interested in the cosmetics/skincare, visit if you have the time just to soak in the ambience. Would say beauty products are cheapest here, often with masks going for Buy 1 get 1 or Buy 2 get 1 with lots of freebies!!! Nice street food though I'd say they can get a little overpriced... Come with umbrella because when it rains, there is no shelter besides the shops."
241,5.0,"There is a total diversity of shops and people in/on this street in Seoul.  The heartbeat of Seoul is very evident there.  We visited in the daytime and then the following evening.  So many people, just happy to be there...as were we.  The pulse can definitely be felt."
242,5.0,This is the Seoul version of Ximending in Taiwan.Streets full of people night or day. Plenty to see and shop but prices are pricier here at this touristy place. Vibes are good and exciting full of young people and tourists.
243,4.0,"Lots and lots of street food. Loved the lobster, pork skewer, kimbap, octopus ball. Did not like the s‚Äômores. Trying to hard to copy Dominique Ansel and it‚Äôs not cheap!! Very difficult to find rubbish bin in this area but each designated shop has their own rubbish bin."
244,3.0,"We spent one evening here, had shaved ice and some street food. Shaved ice was KRW 7900, a simple toast KRW 4500. Some simple chicken skewers KRW 3000 and cheese sausages KRW 4000. Fried idon KRW 5000. Small miserable portion. Didn't buy any beauty products or any souvenirs. We came here a day before our departure, because everyone says you haven't been to Seoul if you don't go to myeongdong. Nah, I wouldn't return to this area again if I'm back in Seoul."
245,5.0,"We stayed in Myeongdong for our week in Seoul. Gull of action day and night. After exploring many other parts of this huge city we‚Äôre pleased we made Myeongdong our base. Very busy Fridays and Saturdays. Well worth trying some of the amazing street food vendors. Great fun, good memories from spending time in this part of Seoul."
246,5.0,There's so many beauty products you can see in every corner of the shopping street. There's also a nice selection of clothes and shoes.
247,4.0,"There are a lot of cosmetic shops opened by Chinese, which might not be selling authentic products. Most of the time, the price is slightly lower than the authentic products, while the quality is not on par. Thus, the best place to shop is still the duty free area, instead of the shopping street."
248,4.0,When you walk around in seoul it is advice to pass by this street! It's crowed and nice but still fun for a walk.
249,5.0,We love this place myself I been here so many time good place to shop and eat street food ! The price is good but remember you pay what you got for ok !! This place day or night the same attraction with a lot of local and tourists walk and shopping!! You will be there in June 5 can‚Äôt wait!
250,5.0,"My wife insisted, ""There will be skin care products!"" And there were. If you're in the market for cosmetics, clothes, and the full Korean 10-step skin care routine, you cannot miss out on Myeongdong. Although quiet during the day, the place really comes alive from early evening. It's not too expensive either - you can definitely get some good deals, some which are announced loudly by trendy salespeople standing outside their designated shops.If you're not looking for a new concealer, maybe you're like me and looking for some good food - luckily, the street has a lot of this as well! There are many street food vendors with delicious food, whether you want spicy chicken, fried octopus, tasty ice cream, sticky strawberry mochi, or something else. There are also a lot of restaurants down the side alleys, but since a lot of these will only be advertised in Korean, my advice is to do your research from home and have a few noted down before going. Else you might just end up living on street food. Which, to be fair, is not a bad way to end the night. It's good, and it's cheap."
251,4.0,"There are dozens of stalls selling several food items. While the quality varies it's nice to try several items. Furthermore, there are about a million stores selling cosmetics and clothes. It's crowded at night and especially on weekends."
252,4.0,"If Ciosmetics is your thing dont miss this area.  A huge trange at very affordable prices and most places will throw in some sample material on top of your purchase.  However, dont be swayed by each store telling you that their product is best.  Do your research first.  Also, try to avoid visiting on a weekend due to massive crowds.  It is much quieter on weekdays."
253,4.0,"Spend a few days in Seoul, lots to do and Myeongdong district should definitely be on your list of to-do‚ÄôsThe food stalls stay till late and offer a great variety of traditional items over and above the many restaurants scattered all over the area. I would recommend to rather snack from the various stalls as opposed to filling up in one stop - you will regret if you did as you walk along!A few great rooftop bars around as well."
254,4.0,"I don't like to shop much but this place is massive and pretty interesting. It has a bit for everyone....but then again that's what most shopping areas cater to ya? I guess you've got to come at least once. Especially for tourists. It is VERY touristy, but hey - I'm a tourist so let it be!There are quite a bit of food places around for you to indulge. Street food on the whole is not very attractive in terms of pricing to me compared to Taipei, this place is a rip off. But we're not in Taipei are we? Transport wise it's very accessible. Metro, buses or cab - take your pick. We had a hotel shuttle that operates in this area so it was even easier."
255,4.0,"When I was in Korea I went to Myeongdong it was around 4 pm and the street vendors were starting to set up. There was a lot of food, makeup and clothing stores. The food and clothes were  relatively cheap, however the makeup could get a little expensive. Be prepared to walk nonstop."
256,5.0,"We stayed at the Hotel28, which was perfect if you want immediate exposure to Myeongdong District.  This is a very large, active shopping area with many street vendors offering freshly fried potato chips, shrimp, sausage, pastries, etc.  While we here, we had the unfortunate timing of extremely cold weather (0 degrees F or -18 C); however, the markets were always packed.  Wherever we went, the streets here (and all over Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean."
257,5.0,This is a fantastic shopping open market! Be prepared to barter! Best tip I can give has a bit in mind what you are looking for and price prepared to pay maximum. Have it translated into Korean and when you see what you are looking for show them your translation? Korean's are not for the most part English speakers!  Look for shops are not afraid to show pricing. If they don't they have 2 prices 1 for locals and the other for stupid tourists. Many shops show we speak english. Have fun !
258,5.0,"This was my favorite ares for shopping in Seoul. Large variety of stores from big brand names, to little stalls. They also had a large variety of food stalls. There are a lot of beauty/skin care stores, but there is  so much more. Check it out!!"
259,5.0,Good place for shopping for stuff like women make up item and shoes. Lots of street food that you can find local are eating as well.
260,4.0,"Much nice and clean than most of the asian shopping streets. Lots of underground stores too, they are not all connected. Be aware since it‚Äôs easy to get disoriented as which one you get out of the underground outlet."
261,5.0,"Great shopping district especially for those who love fashion, Korean street food and late night desserts! Lots of choices and prices are relatively reasonable. Gets really crowded at night too. Staying at a hotel in this district is great as you can go back and unload your shopping bags and take a rest too! :-)"
262,4.0,"I think this area is worth your time exploring. You likely can find what you wants to buy, from this place. There are plenty of shops selling clothing, bags, shoes, toys etc etc. Plenty of street hawkers as well. You will be spoiled for choices. Try to move around comparing prices if you have the extra time and energy, as the same item can be going at different prices at different shops. Can be quite crowded so please take care of your belongings when there."
263,4.0,"Heaven for shoppers, especially ladies who love Korean cosmetics and skincare products. I also like the street foods alot"
264,4.0,"This is a great area to get the best of everything - shopping, street food, restaurants and even massage places : be sure to get a foot rub. We had one after a long day on the feet for 18000 won for 40mins.Also recommend going at night.This place is not for you if you don't like crowds because this area is humming with people both foreigners and locals which makes it all an amazing atmosphere."
265,4.0,"Sent a week in Seoul within walking distance of the Myeongdong Market . Although the market area has lots of stores and shops that are open during the day for shopping, the magic of the are is in the evening when street vendors roll in and setup and offer street food. It‚Äôs fantastic! You can find all kinds of creative offerings. There‚Äôs lots of color, food,and people. The  spirit and energy is terrific. Check it out!"
266,4.0,"This is a very popular area to shop. There is a large variety of stores, but I would recommend going to Uniqlo for great quality and unique every day styles. Be sure to get street food, but skip the waffles. I found them to be too sweet and not worth the hype. Little pastries in the shape of fish filled with custard or red beans are a much better choice."
267,5.0,"Very cool place, lots of shops and restaurants. Literally shop till you drop! In the evening, lots of street food too, very cool vibe!"
268,2.0,"This is an overpriced tacky place where people go to look the same. Many of the streets have the same shops on them, so you can look exactly like everyone else in Seoul. Shudder.There are some cool street merchants and the century old Catholic Church on the hill are a nice diverting highlight."
269,3.0,"The street is super crowded. Be prepared with many people pushing you around.The street food is very expensive. We recommend you to eat at some proper restaurants rather than having street food.It is a great place for shoppaholic. You can find many great items from cosmetics to skincare, clothes to contact lenses, souvenirs to jewellery in this street."
270,3.0,"This is a place that has everything for shopping - even a Cat Cafe. It is certainly busier at night, so be prepared for the crowds."

274,4.0,Best for beauty and cosmetics here.. each shop is slightly different.. there are alot of restaurants here as well.. the street come to life about 6pm with many street goods to choose from but at a price.. the food is not cheap..
275,5.0,"You could spend pretty much all day here since there are so many shops, restaurants and cafes. The vendors start to set up shop around 4pm in the middle of the streets. That‚Äôs when it starts to get crowded and people are lining up for street food.  My favorite was the lobster tail but you have to find the right person that takes his time to prepare the lobster tail and make it right. There were about 5 lobster tail stands spread throughout the shopping street. This place looks nice during the day as well as night.  It‚Äôs less crowded during the day but you wouldn‚Äôt get as much street food as evening and it dies down around 9pm which is probably the best time to go to avoid the crowds but still get to try a little bit of each of their foods."
276,4.0,During the day it is relatively quiet.  You can easily stroll through the streets and browse in the shops.  At night it becomes a street market with numerous food stalls and street sellers. Great atmosphere but super crowded.
277,4.0,The area is good you can buy small thing as cap and phone cove .. too many thing to eat .. I will recommend the place

279,5.0,Myeongdong Shopping Street is shopping haven and also street food heaven. if you looking for cosmetic shop or skin care shop or even newest trends of clothing you'll find it all here.
280,5.0,"During a week in Seoul, every single day I visit this place.During the day, you could find a lot of fashion shops in this area, not to mention the cosmetics shops. If you are a man, shopping with your female partner, hold her hand tightly. Or else she might go wild and spend all the money.This place also has lots of local restaurant and snacks. By 17:00, the locals open more stalls. Most are traditional food. I insist not to leave the market until I try all of them. I gain at least three kg and have no regret at all.The prices are all the same. A grilled lobster tail will cost you 15000 won, whether you buy it in front of the market, or far inside.They also have Oreo‚Äô churros, grilled steak, ice cream with honeycomb, sweet potato, mixed seafood satay, strawberry mochi, twisted potato, and so on. Will be back for sure!"
281,5.0,"I love the street food here but its full of mainland china tourists and i believe because of that, the locals avoid this area. What puzzles me is the sheer number of multiple same-brand shops in this area. I think i saw 3 Zara shops, 5 Innis Free & about 10 shops with more than 2 stores within each corner of the street. I wonder how they stay in business."
282,4.0,This place has a lot of beauty shops around the area and branded shops. You can also enjoy the Korean street food which I really enjoyed and I recommend you should try. Try going around and see the prices before you buy. But I think all shops around offer good deals.
283,5.0,"This is a compulsory place to visit especially for a tourist to get a souvenir, best foods and various choices of cosmetic products. I manage to buy a bundle of face mask with a affordable price and I really enjoy the food there. The food was scrumptious and I can even asked for more. Will surely visit this place again."
284,5.0,"Its a very busy place with local people and tourists but it is definitely worth a visit for the experience. The stores are the same as anywhere else, but there are some market stalls and in the evening lots of food stands to try (prices are reasonable and tend to be similar at different places selling the same thing). Take cash and be sure to have an empty belly!"
285,4.0,"Myeongdong will definitely be a place that you will return for their beauty products (mask, make up, lotions, beauty tools and etc) if you buy in bulk it will be cheaper and they always have promotion for all the brand there."
286,5.0,"Heaven for shoppers and food hunters. I think you can find all Korean cosmetic here. The street food stalls are numerous charging from 3000W. You may also get some souvenirs. Go try two two fried chicken, and Yoogone, very delicious. Also, you may watch the famous Nanta show here, very near to Myeongdong theater."
287,3.0,People are always busy pushing and nudging you in the streets also be prepared for pick pockets stealing from you because of the overgrowded streetsThe shops are great with all types of items to buy but they will follow behind you every ever you go in their shop and then force to sell you the item you are interested in
288,5.0,"For cosmetics, beauty and skincare lover - this is the place to be. There are hundreds of shops and choices of mask, cosmetics, skin care and clothing too..Eateries are plenty around this area so one could shop till you're tired - head to one of the cafes or restaurant for a meal and continue shopping! Street food are all lined up around this area too for those who fancy local street food."
289,5.0,"Wonderful street to check out. Lots of delicious street food in the evenings. If you love cosmetics/skin care, go crazy here! Do be warned about taking ‚Äúfree‚Äù samples though. Only do so if you‚Äôre ok with the shop keeper following around you and hard-selling you items for 5 mins. (I accidentally took 1 free facial mask at a shop and didn‚Äôt dare take anymore!) Other than that, the atmosphere for shopping and eating and soaking in the Seoul life is great! :D"
