0,5.0,"The KTX is a fantastic train, very comfortable and punctual. I have traveled in 1st class and economy class and would definitely recommend this train"
1,5.0,"I love KTX trains. Used them 3 times during my Korea trip and I really like it. Nice and kind people working there and they also know english well, air conditioner inside, fast traveling, lot of space, easy traveling."
2,5.0,I used the KTX to travel from Seoul to Busan and return. I travelled first class seating and reserved my tickets online from Canada and printed them off for the trip. I used the Korail website but their are other agents that will book for you. Cost each way was just under $100 CDN and it took about 2:20 each way.The KTX is the high speed rail option (300kph) for travelling major routes in Korea. It is operated by Korail. There are other options that are slower and cheaper but may be an option for budget conscious travellers.The stations at Seoul and Busan are large and modern with all manner of amenities. The signs are in English as well as Korea and it is relatively easy to find your way around. About an hour before departure the track for your train will be displayed on the board and about 20 minutes before departure you can board the train on that platform. With a reserved seat just find the car and the seat on board.Many people bring food on board. First class had lots of table space and room to set up and eat. The numerous vendors around the station offered all manner of treats and supplies. I enjoyed Gimbap which are essentially long California Sushi Rolls. You also get a cookie and some nuts from the conductor.My ticket was never checked. The conductor came through (bowing when entering) and it appeared as if she compared a listing with which seats were occupied. All in all very straightforward and stress free.Seating was single on one side of the aisle and double on the other side. Lots of room and very comfortable. Carry on was stowed above my head in a rack and there was and area for large item storage by the entrance to the car. There were USB ports for device charging.There is public transit access outside the stations which are located in main business districts downtown.
3,5.0,"Great train system: on time, comfortable, and with big windows for viewing. The actual online system for getting tickets is, however, a real pain, especially if you first buy a pass and then need to get the specific tickets you want. Take seriously the requirement to remember (write down) the pass number."
4,5.0,"I took the KTX train from Seoul to Busan and then back again a couple days later. The entire process was ridiculously easy. First, buy your tickets in advance online (I had no trouble with this, just use common sense and you’ll be fine). I bought the economy seat and it was nice. Then the day of, get to the station 20ish mins before departure. All you need is a printout of the ticket you bought online. Check the boards for the track number, follow the signs to the track, check you’ve got the right train (boards again or on the sign on the train itself), check the car number, board and find your assigned seat. They never even scan or look at your ticket. There is a luggage rack for big suitcases on each car, though if it is carryon size you can fit above your seat. There is a bathroom and small vending machine in each car as well. They display your destination and any stops along the way in English as well as Korean. The entire journey from start to finish was so easy and pleasant."
5,5.0,Took KTX from Seoul station to Dongdaegu for my personal travel.     Although the train was showing some wear and tears it still looked well maintained.    Boarding and departure was on time as usual and ride is very comfortable despite its high speed.     Love the luggage rack space at the rear of the train cars as they are ideal for storing oversized luggage for travelers.    It made a few quick stops at major cities along the way and I arrived in Daegu a few minutes ahead of schedule.   The entire trip took about two hours.     I find high speed train travel in Korea much more convenient than domestic flight as it saves you from heading to airport and clearing security etc.     You can literally show up about 20 to 30 minutes at the station and get on the train.  Convenience factor alone surely beats domestic air travel in Korea.
6,1.0,"I took KTX from Busan to Seoul on 30/3/2019 departure time 14:00.  I came with a group of +/-100 persons (incl. elderly people and children) from Thailand.  It's the first time that I visit Korea. After the train has passed around 2 stations. There are passengers (Korean) who got the tickets with the same seat number.  They asked us to get out from the seat but we refused.  After that, our tour leader and the guide were tricked by train officer.  He told us to move to the next car which has more seats.  So, in order to avoid trouble and argue with Korean passengers, we moved to next car. but there are no seats at all.  This mean all of us have to stand for 2 hours to Seoul. The officers (old man and lady) in KTX has low service mind and can't communicate in English.  I could say the rail system in Japan and China train are even better than KTX/Korail.  Moreover, even you want to send the complain letter, they have no e-mail or FB to hear the feedback from customer as well.  So, don't expect for improvement in near future."
7,5.0,"Travel from Seoul all the way to Busan in under 2.5 hours. It was a smooth ride with free WiFi, comfortable seating  Travel on KTX several times."
8,5.0,"runs like clock works, and cheap and fast enough for a day trip to Busan from Seoul.  Sure beats the waiting on the airport for a short ride."
9,4.0,"I like to take KTX train when I don't want to take the bus, or I want a faster way to get home. KTX is very convenient. A can be pricey, which is the negative. It gets you faster to your destination, compared to the bus, but it can be pricey. However, the ride is smooth, and you can rest and pull your chair back to rest. So much more comfortable just a little bit than being in the airplane."
10,2.0,"The very first thing I noticed about this train is that it almost looks like an Amtrak train, inside and out. The train design is outdated, and certainly doesn’t look like it belongs being a bullet train. I will get back to the design issue shortly. On the inside, half of the cars seats face forward, half backwards, with no ability to change them. There is also no way that I know of to determine which direction your reserved seat will face. That aside, the inside of the train is stuffy, the grey carpet roofing tacky, and just a generally dated design.Here is where the exterior and interior design issues come together: the train hits speeds of up to 265km (164miles) per hour. It’s cabin does not pressurize/depressurize properly, leaving you with bloated ears and general discomfort most of the way. Combined with the stuffy interior, and a backward facing seat, you may, like me, wish you had taken a bus.One other thing I learned about this train is that other than different colored seats and a tad more space and free bottled water, there is no additional benefit to reserving first class seats, something which even Amtrak in America has figured out.For some perspective, I’ve been on high speed trains in Europe and Japan, and other than its speed which the cars are ill-suited for, this train is not in the same league. It’s just a regular train with a powerful engine, totally not meant for the sub-par cars it’s attaches to."
11,2.0,"This could be an isolated case but when I took the KTX from Busan to Seoul, there was a power outage which caused the train to be delayed by more than 4 hours. KTX staff could not speak English and I had to figure things out on my own (where to take the train, when will the train arrive etc). The journey from Busan to Seoul in the end took 6 hours, with long stops at various stations. I am highly disappointed in the service, considering how high the price is compared to other mode of transportation. Would expect staff to be able to converse in basic English or announcements to be made in English."
12,4.0,"I had taken the KORAIL Pass for tourists for 3 days as I on the first day itself I was travelling from Seoul to Gyeongju, next day from Gyenongju to Busan and then to Seoul. If you don't have KORAIL Pass, you can purchase the tickets. It is faster and the seats are comfortable."
13,4.0,"I travelled on KTX from Busan to Seoul. The train departed on time and I was sitting in economy class which was comfort, smooth and quite nice. However, the train made 5-6 stops before approaching to its final destination at Seoul station. Hence, it arrived Seoul 32 minutes later than estimated."
14,5.0,Took the KTX from Seoul and Busan. Found it comfortable and it was a neat way to see South Korea. Didn't have much issue with luggage. Do recommend trying if traveling long distances.
15,4.0,Very convenient.But the seats are a little too small for an adult.In my opinion maybe they can make the seats larger about 50%.I am an Asian still think it is too small.非常便利。但是唯有椅子似乎超嫌狹小。我個人認為或許他們可以把椅子加大50%左右。我身為一個亞洲人都嫌椅子有點小了。
16,4.0,"The train ride from seoul to Busan was fantastic. The trains were fast, clean and spacious. The windows were very clean which meant you got a good view of the scenery as you went past. I would highly recommend.The only thing worth flagging is that around the weekend and public holidays the train can book out so book early."
17,4.0,Korea’s bullet trains get the job done. Gets you to any major city from Seoul within 2 hours-ish. Amenities are basic but that’s okay because you are never on the train for long enough.My one pet peeve is the lack of sitting room in Seoul station. Had to resort to sitting in McDonald’s to wait for my train.
18,5.0,"KTX is the best, quickest and most comfortable way to travel to Busan.A day trip is easily done, with leaving Seoul early and coming back the same evening/night. 1st class is worth the little extra, as it not only more comfortable, but also quieter."
19,5.0,"I went from Busan back to Seoul by KTX, the train was lovely and comfy as well as super quiet even though the carriage was full :') the train was super fast and only too around 2/2.5 hours to get back into the city the views of Korea were amazing seeing all the small villages and towns as well as the mounatins and green areas. so pretty!"
20,5.0,"Runs on time. Roomy and comfy with free fast wi-fi. Clean toilets on board makes the trip to and from the airport a breeze. Ground staff are warm, polite and very helpful for any queries."
21,4.0,"Great to book online, trains were good. Downside is that you still have to have the ticket printed at the station"
22,4.0,"Th train look like old generation French TGV (in fact they are!)  and are thus not the most comfortable but the comparison stops here: Clean, on time, ultra efficient (from online reservation to station indication, to boarding,. etc. The trip was very pleasant.  French technology and South Korean service quality seem to make for a good receipt!"
23,2.0,There aren’t any areas to put your luggage if you are traveling with ones that cannot be placed in the over head compartments. (Only place is the back seat with the space behind so I suggest you quickly book those) You’ll have to deal with cramming it inside your seat area with no space to put your legs for hours.
24,5.0,"Take the express to Seoul, rather than taking a taxi. You will save roughly $70 if you are alone. The KTX costs around $25-$30 per person (depending on exchange rate), so if you are more than 3, you may want to take a taxi. I still think the KTX is more convenient, faster and don't have to worry about traffic or getting into an accident. The train has Wifi, so you will be connected. Cool. There are no drinks or food on the train so if you want to eat something, buy it beforehand. Depending on where you will be actually staying in Seoul, it might be better to take the normal train (not the KTX). The normal train is far cheaper and it costs me only $2 to get to Seoul, instead of the KTX. Yes, it takes 20 minutes longer, but I would rather save $20 for the 20 minutes. :-) Now, there goes the tip. Once the KTX drops you off at Seoul STation, you will have to take a taxi or take the metro anyhow.... assuming you are not staying at Seoul Station area. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
25,5.0,Experience like no other.  You can even watch a movie and won´t feel that you are traveling. Very comfortable sits.
26,5.0,"It is my 3rd time to take KTX.Took 2hours 44mins from Seoul to Busan.It always punctual, fast and clean.You can have free wifi too."
27,5.0,"I have completed 8 return trips from Busan to Seoul. Airlines more expensive and time consuming given travel to both airports and security. Booked on line and went to Busan Station to book days, easy, wrote travel days and time to give to staff. Busan has a info. desk to get timetable as would Seoul.Takes 2.5 hrs but delivers you in the center of both cities.Highly recommended."
28,4.0,"I took a KTX from Seoul to Busan, and thanks to the speed I could did a day visit and get back in the same day. It´s an alternative if you don´t want to take an airplane. They have several trains during the day."
29,5.0,On the way in from the airport i took the bus because i knew precisely where I was getting off - essential when the street names are so similar - but on the way back I took the train which was much easier and very efficient
30,5.0,"It is very accessible and easy to get train tickets even at the very last moment. I bought my ticket to Busan on the day i was heading there. And I just need to wait for 30 minutes which is enough time for me to grab a quick lunch before boarding the train. The seats of the train is also very comfortable with enough leg room to stretch. The seat can even be shifted so that you are leaning slightly backward and comfortable enough for you to sleep. There is also a removable table for you to put your stuff. For some seats, there are even charging point for you to plug in to charge your electronics devices. Excellent transportation system. Would definitely go for it again when I head to other part of the South Korea."
31,5.0,"Convenient, comfortable, goes to many locations but have to check the schedule beforehand because it stops early for some locations"
32,5.0,"Took it to and from Seoul to the Olympics. Reliable, convenient, seats are pretty comfy. Just need a little better wifi, and maybe a little cheaper tickets."
33,5.0,Awesome new train service from Seoul to Gangneung on the coast. You can also take this directly to and from the airport. It's now only about 1 hour 40 mins from Seoul to Gangneung.
34,5.0,Decided to use KTX for my travel to southern port city of Yeosu.     My train left from Yongsan train station instead of the usual Seoul train station.     The trip takes a little over two hour and it is super comfortable.   Interior is fairly modern and they sell some snacks and drinks along the way.      I will certainly use KTX for all my future travels in Korea.
35,5.0,"The KTX is the fast train in South Korea it will take you to Busan in 2 hours. Is really comfortable you can pay for first class or the regular ticket, i did it regular and was really fine. Busan have incredible sea food so was really worthwhile the trip there. Thismtrain will take you to a different cities in Sout Korea, you can take your suitcases too. And can admire the beuty of the country side too."
36,5.0,"It prices about a half of the other country's express train. Clean, and fast. It's only 40$ if you want to go from Seoul to Busan."
37,4.0,"I was expecting the KTX to be like the bullet train in Japan but to be fair the exerience is nothing like it.Trains are not as fast, carriages are more European style, with comfy seats, socket to charge devices and large tray tables, but these trains do not have the space of the Japanese ones nor the speed.A major problem on these train is luggage space. If you have a large-ish suitcase you will struggle as space in between carragies is super limited.I had a reserved seat and had to travel sat in the corridor having to hold my case instead than in my seat.Go to the station super early, start queuing by your car number (indicates on the floor) and hope to get a space.But a train pass before you arrive in Korea."
38,4.0,"I took KTX from Cheonan/Asan to ICN on 1st class seat. Configuration is 2-1. 1st class has wider pitch and comfortable wider seat. They give you small cookies only on 1st class.There are not so many KTX trains going to ICN  directly. So if you want to go to ICN from local cities such as Cheonan , most of the case you need to change train at Seoul main station."
39,5.0,"In the 8 years that I lived in Korea, I caught the KTX many times.   I did the routes from Seoul-Daegu, Daegu-Seoul, Daegu - Busan, Busan - Daegu, Seoul-Ulsan, Ulsan - Seoul, Ulsan - Busan, Busan - Ulsan, Gwangju - Yongsan, and Yongsan - Gwangju .... countless times each.   The KTX is a wonderful experience.   It is efficient, smooth, and very much on time.   The trains are clean, and the service on board is generally very good.   I used both economy and first class carriages.   I thoroughly recommend taking the KTX."
40,4.0,Easy way to travel around most places in Korea.  Fairly comfortable and clean on the train and the stations are nice
41,4.0,"Efficient train, free wifi onboard. Only thing to note is that the credit card function on the ticket machine only takes cards with 4digit pin (so if your card has a 6 digit pin you'll need to buy straight from the counter)"
42,5.0,"I use the KTX when I travel to Seoul. It's clean, comfortable and a smooth ride.  Plus it has wifi!FYI - If you tavel first class, seat A, is a single seat next the window, and B and C are together."
43,5.0,"Took the KTX from Seoul to Mokpo.  Very easy to arrange directly from the Website.  Opted for first class- it was only $20 more.  Great experience.  IF you dont want to worry about changing trains, like me, look at the schedule and book the non-transfer train.  Smooth, comfortable ride.   Power for your phone at each seat.  Big windows.  Shade is shared by every 2 rows, so hopefully you are paired with people that like to look out windows (and not afraid of a little sun glare).  Very clean.  They bring you bottled water.  Great one to get under your belt if you are a train lover live I am."
44,5.0,"It takes about 2.5 hours on this superfast train from Seoul to Busan.  It is a good way to see the countyside.  Nowadays, it seems Korea has developed all along the train route and one mostly gets to see tall apartment buildings and cities.   A lot of the ride is covered by tunnels.   But, it is still an interesting way to see the countryside.   Many rice paddies along the way.   The first class is great.  You get free water and have to get it from a vending machine in the vestibule.  An attendant walks along multiple times with snacks and coffee for purchase.  An alternative way would be to purchase hot prepared food to go in the train station and enjoy it on the way.   Trains are relatively new."
45,5.0,"Took the metro train to Seoul station with the intention of purchasing a KTX ticket. Went upstairs to the ticketing section and waited in line for around 5 minutes. Paid for economy ticket hoping I had made the right choice. Purchased ticket at 10:30 am and was booked for the 10:50 am. Went downstairs to platform 6 and found my carriage quite easily. Was fortunate to get a forward facing window seat though it really doesn't matter that much. There is nothing overly exciting about the view although there is nothing wrong with it either when the train isn't in a tunnel. Seats are comfortable and the leg room is better than some airlines. The train left on time and was a smooth ride all the way. I had some sushi I purchased at the station at around the halfway point although you can buy snacks on the train if you wish. Overall a fast, simple and comfortable way to travel from Seoul to Busan."
46,5.0,"I've travelled on this regulalrly for over 10 years, usually between Daegu and In'cheon. I always travel first class only because unlike the UK, first class means better standard and more comfortable rather than 'so expensive there is no one sat next to you'. This translates as more leg room, wider seats, free bottles of water which is useful in summer. In the UK first class is exactly the same design as second class in terms of physical comfort. The trains are impecabbly clean and every carriage has TV screens which provide interesting programs tailored to the stops on the way. Before a stop is approached the approaching destination is announced and a short program gives details of some quirk associated with the town or area. A refreshment trolly appears at regular intervals and isn't expensive.The KTX is incredibly fast and since 2002 several new engines have been deployed including the KTX 2 (Sancheon) and KTX 3. KTX 3 will increase normal operational speed from 190 mph to 230 mph which is 105 mph faster  than the British 125 which can no longer be termed a 'high speed train' because it is so freakin slow.The crew and carriage staff, which you rarely see on British Rail look and behave more like cabin crew on an airline. The Daegu-Busan also has a cinema carriage showing latest movies."
47,5.0,"Signed up and paid for KTX pass whilst in UK. On arrival at Incheon airport collected pass and booked a round trip Seoul to Busan,ticket office near exit gate 9 in arrival hall,young lady spoke good English, quick and easy ,seats allocated and reserved both ways.Go to Korail  site  booking online enter details and a timetable will be displayed.Train clean ,departed and arrived ontime, refreshments onboard. The stations are easy to find your way around as all signs are in Korean + English"
48,4.0,Used the ktx to get from Seoul to Daegu for a flight to Beijing. Took a little over 2 hours..  So smooth and quiet.. Only had to wait 30mins for the train as they run frequently.  Just rocked up to Seoul Station and booked there.. No need to book in advance..
49,5.0,"I take the KTX several times a month, mostly between Seoul and Daejeon.I often opt for first class, that affords more personal space and a few less fellow travelers.I prefer KTX to the bus, the big issue for many is the price.The KTX trains can't be beat for speed and comfort, there are nice bathrooms on board!"
50,5.0,"I rode the KTX from Seoul to Gwangju and back.  Very smooth ride and you would never guess 310 kmph!  I was able to shoot video from the window without blurring, which was a nice surprise to me.  Snacks leave much to be desired so I suggest you bring your own, but then again, who needs a snack for a 2 hour ride?"
51,5.0,Seoul Station - clean efficient - easy to get ticket- staff here seem to have a better command of English.Have to book your seat as it is very popular.I chose first class and filled to capacity. Afforadable and think it is good value.SKX operated by KOTrains is a knock out experiance.Trains run on Swiss timing - sorry on exceptional Korean timing.Children friendly.Wheel chair friendly.
52,4.0,"I came to Seoul during high season and tried to book a ticket from Seoul to Busan for the next morning but it was full booked already. I came again in the next morning and got a ticket since there was a passenger canceling his reservation, just 10 minutes before departing! My first experience boarding KTX and it was worth it! I was curious why the train officer didn't check my ticket since passengers kept coming and go though... anyway, don't forget to buy a packed lunch at the train station before you get on the train!"
53,4.0,"They now run five direct trains from Busan Station to ICN airport station that don't require you to change in Seoul Station. Train goes 300 km/hr at times.  Bit less flashy than Japanese bullet trains, but still quite good."
54,4.0,"This is something I totally regret not finding out earlier when my sister just came to visit me. KR Pass is a train pass that allows foreigners visiting or residing in Korea to have unlimited train rides on KORAIL trains up to ten days (depending on the kind of pass you chose). NO LIMITS on the number of times you travel within the day pass period you chose, and NO LIMITS on travel area! Unless you are just thinking of traveling back and forth Busan for once, there is no point buying this KR Pass. If you are intending to be taking the KTX to various regions in Korea, I'd suggest you this pass which can help you save loads! For step by step information on reserving KR pass, you can refer more here, http://irenesiah.blogspot.kr/2014/06/traveling-with-korea-rail-kr-pass.html"
55,4.0,"It took about 2.5 hours to get from Busan to Seoul. I was riding the economy class and I felt the ride was fairly comfortable. There's an open wifi connection on the train, but for some reason I could only access it for a limited time and wasn't able to renew the connection. (I got an error message in Korean that I couldn't understand) Leg space is decent and comparable to that of budget airlines like Tiger Air and Air Asia."
56,4.0,"I made my reservation b4 I left for Korea and all a while everything was fine. Out of the blue I decided to checkout the Busan train station so I won't be trying to figure things out b4 I left the next day. I checked my reservation and I showed them my confirmation and it wasn't there. The agent rebooked and even got my same sitting assignment, whew! Double check your rsvn prior to departure a few days, if you have that option, in advance. Everything beside that was smooth sailing. 1st class is the way 2go, comfortable seat for 1 or 2. Fast, clean, affordable, loved it!Oct 7, 2012"
57,5.0,"I enjoy taking the KTX whenever I am traveling throughout Korea. Like the bus service, which is not bad either, there are several trains to various cities throughout the country in a given day. Train travel in Korea is convenient and VERY fast. South Korea is not a big country so driving between even the two furthest points won't take more than a few hours, but if you're not interested in driving or sitting on a bus (traffic in Korea can be a real nightmare), the train is an inexpensive and convenient option. Note, however, that there are several classes of trains, so if you don't want to have to stand or deal with potential discomfort, be sure that it's a KTX ticket you're getting and not something else. It will set you back more but that's a given."
58,3.0,"In Korean website, you can get discount up to 30% if you have a foreigner permit or Korean and choosing seat (facing forward or backward , window seat or aisle seat) . Unfortunately, English website doesn't have those services...I just booked a ticket from Seoul to Busan. I was opening Korean and English website at the same time that I could know that my auto assigned seat , my seat is facing forward (I will feel faint if sitting backward seat) and window seat."
59,5.0,"I enjoyed riding the KTX from Seoul to Busan. It was an enjoyable trip and I loved looking at the building and countryside as this fast train roared to Busan. The price is reasonable at about $50 USD each way for standard, and about $80 USD for first class seats, and I think it is a very fast and easy way to get to Busan from Seoul. I recommend buying your tickets in advance. Since I bought my ticket the morning of my trip, I was assigned an aisle seat though I wanted a window one, but the nice gentleman at the window seat willingly exchanged with me once I explained politely in broken Korean that I needed to take pictures as we go.  The train interior is clean and you can buy food and drinks on the train. Originally, I had planned to buy first class tickets for more quiet and privacy, but ended up with standard tickets. All in all, it did not matter since l enjoyed my trip."
60,5.0,"I asked a friend of mine who was local to place if they'd recommend taking the regular train which was around 3 or 4 hours, thinking I'd enjoy the view and the trip. He gave me a tired look and said ktx would be faster, and therew as not much to see. I was grateful I listened to his advice, as I saw myself there 30'minutes before the scheduled departure. The train was efficient, food and drinks served at a good price. For 53,300 won from Busan to Seoul I was expecting that maybe the seats were a little new, but seemed to be a little worn out. More than that, I couldn't complain more as to how efficient this was!"
61,5.0,"During my travel to Korea, I took KTX from Seoul to Busan (on Nov. 11 / Economy) and Busan to Seoul (on Nov. 12 / First Class).  It was my introduction to ""high speed rail"" travel.  As I was coming to Korea after trekking in Nepal, I had a GPS with me. The ride was so smooth and I was curious about how fast it was travelling.  So I checked my GPS and it was showing the speed as 280 km/h.  These days many people, especially Koreans, are shouting about ""world class this"", ""world class that"".  Without any reservation, my entire experience with KTX including ticket purchasing, boarding, on-board service, and departure / arrival punctuality was excellent.  KTX, yes, you can call yourself the World Class!     john / Vancouver Island, BC, Canada"
62,5.0,"I purchased a five day KORAIL pass from www.korail.com and on some of my journeys used it on the KTX, sometimes upgrading to first class for the minimal extra cost of KRW8500.Staff, punctuality,great frequency,seating, trolley service and a quiet environment to watch good scenery skimming by all contribute to an excellent travel experience.Well done KORAIL.  200 per cent better than flying!"
63,5.0,"Traveled from Seoul to Busan, 1st class, good value, on time, spotless, fast, quiet, wifi, just like train travel here in UK!!!!!!"
64,5.0,I took the KTX round trip from Yeosu Expo to Seoul. Left exactly on-time. Boarding usually starts 15 mins before departure. First Class is wells worth the extra money. Comfy seats with a less crowded cabin. Travel time took 3 hours 27 minutes.... Not bad at all from city center to city center...
