0,5.0,"I was just there on Saturday and enjoyed my stroll although it was quite cold. Many blossoms were up. It wasnâ€™t busy, and it is so easy to get to. Not far from Yongsan station. You can take the train or taxi. I took a bus and got off right in front of the National Museum of Hangeul which I visited as well on that day. The bust stop is right in front of the park too. The park connects the Hangeul Museum to the National Museum of Korea which I visited many times."
1,4.0,We went to the National Museum hoping to hop through the exhibits but I gravitated towards this park at the back of the museum.  I enjoyed sitting by the benches and watching the people walk around getting their daily exercise.  It is such a beautiful place for outdoors activities.  Even the occasional drizzling did not detain the people from coming and enjoying the place.
