They had removed all the bullets, applied cement over it to close up the hole, then painted a very fake looking red and white bulls eye over the supposed bullet holes.Didn't see no soldiers guarding the place.And yes - the stairs are really quite grueling!We carted up 1.5L of water per person based on other reviews. We drank at most 1L each. And we went on a hot summer day at noon. Most of it is quite shady thanks to the treesWould I recommend this to anyone? NO! Unless you enjoy hiking 2 hours to look at fake bullet holes. View was quite nice tho but you get the same thing at Namsan Hill with a fraction of the effort"
1,5.0,"My son and I did a day trip to visit all the remaining gates of seoul fortress. We started at the Malbawi Information Center and hiked to the Changuimun Information Center. This course was easier than hiking from the Changuimun Gate.Depending on your level of fitness, the hike may take between 2 - 2 1/2 hours. The steps should not be underrated as they are very steep in some areas. There are no toilet or garbage facilities after reaching the Malbawi Center, so ensure that you have sufficient water and carry your garbage with you until the end of the hike.Malbawi Information Center may be reached by taking subway line 3 to Anguk Station, then bus # 2 to Sungkyunkwan University Rear gate. There is no visible bus stop at the university, but it will be clear that you are at the last stop. It is the stop after the entrance to Waryog Park, and is a steep climb uphill. I think that it was the 8th bus stop from Anguk. Continue to walk uphill for 5 minutes and the Seoul Fortress wall will be seen. Walk along the path next to the wall for 600 meters, always keeping the wall in view on your left, and you will reach Malbawi information Center. It should be noted that there are few signs in English , and at one point a small foot bridge is passed and a really steep staircase that when climbed takes you over the wall. When on the other side of the wall, the malbawi Information center is a 5 minute walk away.Passports have to be provided for inspection and a form filled out, after which an ID tag will be received. This tag is placed around your neck and will have to be returned to Changuimun/Malbawi Information Center after your hike is completed. Guards are posted at regular intervals along the trail, and photos may only be taken at the following areas: Sukjeongmun gate, Baegakmaru, Chatdaebawi Rock, 1.21 Pine Tree, Baegak Rest area and Dolrae Rest Area. If in doubt, ask the guard if you can take a photo.The hike offers beautiful views of Seoul, and the North and Northwest gates of Seoul Fortress. At the Changuimun Gate there is a bronze statue and memorial stone for soldiers who died during the 1.21 incident. Buses to Gwanghwamun Square can be easily taken by crossing the road at Changuimun gate."

My son is very active, a strong hiker, and had no problem with the physical challenge. My wife and I are fit but nevertheless our legs were quite sore by the end of the hike. From the direction we came (East to West) there is a very steep 300m decsent at the end of the hike which was difficult on the knees. The views of Seoul are fantastic. The view looking down on the royal palace is interesting. This hike was not available to civilians until it was opened in 2012. This is a military zone due to the proximity to the Korean presidential residence and photos are restricted. Bring your passport (visitors) or alien registration card (residents) if you are not a Korean citizen."
