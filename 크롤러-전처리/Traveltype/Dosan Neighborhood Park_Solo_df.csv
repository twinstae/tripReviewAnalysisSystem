0,4.0,"I stumbled into this park, walking around this rather upmarket precinct. Directly opposite the park entrance, is a golden Sulwhasoo Building. As I read the signage, I realized that this is a memorial park for a man known as Dosan Ahn Chang-Ho. I hadn't a clue. He must be some kind of patriot as there are South Korea flags all over. The next thing that struck me, is the chirping of birds.There are no bodies of water in this park. Neither are there lots of flowers. It is, however, very lush with bushes & trees. There are benches & sheltered pagodas, and an exercise area. Then  I was with the statute of Dosan Ahn Chang-Ho. As everything was in Korean, I made a mental note to google about man & learnt a little more about Korea history. (note: what i read made me admire his courage & love for Korea greatly).It is a nice little park. As the name suggests, it is a nice neighborhood park which does not charge entrance fee, and a nice humble greenery patch in the midst of all the glitzy concrete. Given the humble nature of Dosan Ahn Chang-Ho, the glitzy neighborhood is probably not his cup of tea.  I love parks and have seen lots of parks. This is not a park I would deliberately travel to visit. The biggest highlight, is learning about Doson Ahn Chang-Ho."

3,5.0,"Dosan Park is a wonderful easy and serene place to visit in the midst of all the hubbub and traffic of Seoul.  It's next to shopping and spa areas, and also nice restaurants, so you don't have to go to just the park.  Very great place!"
