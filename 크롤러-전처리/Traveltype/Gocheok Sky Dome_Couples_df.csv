0,5.0,"Went for SBS 2019 Kpop Concerts at Go Cheock Sky Dome. It is amazingly huge and big. Really enjoy the KPOP concerts features anchoring group like BTW, TWICE, MAMAMOO and many more. The stage lighting and performance is amazingly fantabulous, and exciting. Love the performance overall is worth the money and time to come here. Here is the place not to be missed. What a place to spend xmas over here ☺️☺️☺️"
1,4.0,"We went to see The Weeknd here.  This stadium is huge and a great place to see a concert.  However, coming from the western world, if you're not seeing a K-Pop act, the crowd will be fairly timid and relatively quiet."
2,4.0,"It's a bit more sterile -- and of course cleaner--than Doosan Bear's Jamsil Stadium, but there is no better place to be when its 90 degrees outside and the fans are going wild, the entire 9 innings. For the best experience of watching Korean baseball sit in the sections in front of the ceerleading stands -- 104, 105, 202, 203 for home team Nexen Heroes and 110, 110, 208, 209 for visiting team. If for just watching baseball, anywhere is good. As prior reviewers noted, one of the major drawbacks is lack of few food choices and the menus are in Korean (no English help)"
3,5.0,We went here for a live concert of awesome Britney Spears! And this place is exactly what you need to watch the concerts of such and amazing celebrities like Britney! A lot of place. Many redtrooms and smoking booths. It was amazing time for me and my wife!
4,5.0,Amazing park. MLB quality. Can't wait to visit again for the pool play of the next World Baseball Classic. 50k fans can fit easily
