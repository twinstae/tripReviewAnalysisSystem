0,1.0,"Paid the price of losing to learn through the hard way. This place is designed for you to lose. This casino is not big at all. If you want maximum fun and win some money, go to Singapore's Resort World or Marina Bay Sands. They are 10 times bigger.1) Minimum bet for Blackjack is KRW 30,000 but there is only one table and it mostly gets hogged. Whereas they have 3-4 other empty tables with dealers with minimum bets of 50,000 and 100,000. You'll need a massive bankroll to win at these higher limits. Pit boss keeps an eye on how much you win or loses. I know because I speak Korean and Ive heard them discussing.2) Min bet for Bacarrat is 100,000 with only 2 tables. In fact, most table games have min bets of 100,000.3) As for slot machines, the minimum max lines per pull is around KRW 4,400. You can wage at a lower bet with lesser lines, which reduces your winnings when you hit free games. Again, you need a big bankroll which most tourists do not have prepared unless you are a high roller.4) They give free 50,000 if you are a new member but its only limited to the game of Bacarrat. Min bet is 100,000 so you have to pay to use the free chips. Do not accept their free gift (a useless keychain which was probably jinxed to make you lose lol)5) Restaurant wasn't open, had to wait for 30 mins. Decided to leave. 7 luck is much better.6) the location is too far and you have to take a bus. You can take a cab there, keep the receipt. They let you claim 30,000 worth of credits.Bottomline : Go there if you want to lose.You have been warned!"
1,1.0,Terrible service towards foreigners.  Been going for months due to no other casinos in the area but will never go again. Terrible customer service and discriminating towards foreigners
2,5.0,"Went to Paradise specifically to play poker so this review is only about that.  They had a few tables going.  Manager was friendly.  The dealers were solid.  And the drink service was really good.  Not sure why so many low reviews about this place...I played 1000-2000 KW Texas Holdem no-limit.  All the players were friendly.  English is the preferred language.Great place to go for casual play on your trip.  If you are looking for serious competition and big money, this is not the place.It's easy to get to from subway via shuttle bus (Line 5 Gwangnaru stop. Exit door #2.  Cross Achasan-ro street and walk 200 feet north.  Look for brown Walkerhill shuttle bus sign).  The shuttle also stops at Gangbyeon on Line 2.One of the better poker experiences I have had across the world (despite getting felted by 8-4 offsuit by that Chinese guy who plays 100% and wins 99%! - you all know what I am talking about...)."
3,4.0,"Came here as part of the 10 day layover on my way back to the US from the Philippines.  As an avid poker player, I wanted to see the offering.  Took the train to the local station and then a $5 cab ride got me here.  You have to be a foreigner to come here, so bring your passport.Casino is nice.  Service was good, too.  Poker room manager explained everything to me and was very helpful getting me into the game.  Free food and drinks only for table games players, so if you want some free noodles, buy in for $10 at a blackjack table, ask for the menu, order something, and it will be waiting for you at the restaurant in 5 minutes.Exchange rates suck, but you get the same rate both ways up to the amount that you initially bought.  If you end up winning money, keep the excess and change it outside of the hotel.Poker game was awesome.  I played the bigger game and it was good action against weak players.  I could make a living playing here.Don't know if I will ever go back to Korea, but will go back here if I do."
4,1.0,"As a non-Korean gambler, I have played at Paradise Walkerhill casino many times.  However, after today, I will no longer do so after their discriminatory practices.First, they demanded that I must stay at the blackjack table for a minimum number of hands.  Basically, over the course of two weeks, I had hot streaks and had the self control to leave the table on the positive side after these runs (and after tipping dealers).  Then they instituted a rule and told me that I HAVE to stay at the table for a minimum amount of time.  Even if I am losing, I have to stay a minimum amount.  Or even if I feel like I have played enough and want to leave.Refusing to agree to this (and not get cash back for my chips), they said that I could not open any blackjack tables.  They said I could only play at a table that was already open, but I could only play the limits that they had.  So despite the fact I sat down and there were 3 open tables, they ""told me"" what the limit was.  That's it.  No discussion.  And despite the fact you are allowed to request deck type, they refused.  Funny, there were no complaints when I lost big money last month.Needless to say, I have fired off emails to the Korean casino regulators, where a casino is trying to force me to stay at the table."
