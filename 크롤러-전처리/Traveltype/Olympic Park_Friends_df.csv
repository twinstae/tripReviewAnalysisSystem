0,5.0,This is one of the nearest to be in if you want to be in a place where full of trees. It could be crowded especially during a festival or an event. A great escape for couples where needs to spend alone time.
1,4.0,"although I'm not a big fan of flowers, i still went to olympic park, just to make sure, i would go to every part of seoul before i went back for good. im not sure what to do here, but the park is quite big, if you come during the summer, there will be small rose garden, cosmos flower, orange color, then another one type of flower which i dont know but the color were purple and pink. the scenery was so beautiful, i went there before 1-2 hours before dusk, and take the pic at the sun set color."
2,3.0,if you ever go to the winter Olympics stay in one town that you want to see the best and don't leave . it is a real pain running around to get to what you want to see plus constellations and it can dang cold . now that said it is all neat as you can imagine set very cool and worth going to one time at least to see . ( bucket list )
3,4.0,"It was about time for me to go to the Olympic Park after so many visits to Seoul. It was a Sunny Monday. Most other tourist attractions in Seoul are closed on  Mondays. Hence, it was an excellent stroll around!"
4,4.0,30 years after the Seoul Olympics and the park is a living testament of the Olympic legacy. Best to visit in Spring or Summer when the lake is full and gardens are at their best. A curiosity is the old GDR flag is still flying on the edge of the central square.
5,5.0,"Olympic Park is a huge complex where you can see stadiums, around 200 different statues and there is also a park with a nice nature to walk through. I especially enjoyed visiting the 1988 Olympics flags plaza - interesting to see how many countries do not exist any more and how many changed their flag design."
6,5.0,"The park is a bit out of the way, I remember it taking us quite a while to get here from Hongdae. However, because of this it's a quiet place for a nice stroll or bike ride away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. You can see a lot of the locals utilizing this place and it's nice use of land built for the olympics previously as you hear in the news that more recent venues are completely unused or abandoned. I would recommend biking around the area since it's quite large too."
7,5.0,"I had seen the poster for the jazz festival in this park. When we saw the huge crowd, we were extremely happy.It is a peaceful place to relax. Trash receptacles were placed throughout the park. So, we can enjoy festivals!!!!!!!!!"
8,5.0,"I lived a walk away from Olympic Park for a year and a half. It has everything you could want for recreational variety and spending almost nothing. It is a beautiful expansive park where you can rent bikes, Jarveys and eat and drink from many vendors. There are lots of free sports facilities and there are lots of state of the art facilities. The Olyoic facilities have been maintained well amd are used also. There are cafes and stores at many of the entrances. I attended some great concerts there and the Davis cup was held there in 2015. Each entrance offers a different experience and each exit has a subway or a local neighbourhood to explore. One of my great loves of Seoul was exploring it and this Park sits very near the top."
9,4.0,"Beautiflu park, worth visitng and walking around. The view of water, grass, flowers, everything is well preserved. The flags square and fire is cool if you are interested in that sort of stuff."
10,4.0,"There is so much to do and see at this beautiful park! My husband and I spent an afternoon walking around, enjoying the Olympic theme, outdoor sculptures, street food vendors, and entertainment options. It is a huge park with lots of open space and can accommodate large crowds easily. We rented bicycles while we were there and we noticed visitors could also rent scooters and pedal-driven coaches with built-in canopies for shade. You could also bring a picnic lunch and chairs to enjoy the several lawn areas. During our visit, we also toured the Olympic-themed museum on the property."
11,5.0,"Will go to Olympic Park once I travel to Seoul, I have been there in spring, summer, autumn and winter.  It is suitable for everyone in any season to visit.  It definitely a good place to relax and unwind."
12,4.0,"This Olympic park has been kept in great condition and is still a wonderful place to walk around on a nice day. There are plenty of different areas as the park is so big. There are several sports facilities still on the site, as well as bike hire. The Olympic spirit lives on too, with plenty of reminders of the games including some sculptures, the giant arch way, the flagpoles and the stones donated by each nation which took part. Some countries who no longer exist are still there too which is nice for nostalgia seekers. This was the last Olympic games for a lot of nations."
13,3.0,Its great that Seoul has gotten use of their olympic park. Its a nice area where you get to see some historical thing along with the old stadiums. But its doesnt give a lot more than that. Plan a shorter trip here. You might be lucky and be in Seoul when they arrange events in the park.
14,5.0,Seoul Olympic Park is huge! Would be nice to travel back to 1988 for the Olympics. Perfect for people who like to walk and have a good time.
15,4.0,"We took a walk around the park to have a look, and there are some good places to take a break and enjoy the view. We picked the lonely tree and also at one of the main fountains. You can rent trolleys and bikes at the entrance of the park where the diffrent halls are located."
16,4.0,"It's a nice park with beautiful structures and sceneries. There might be one or two museums nearby which you can visit. There are bike rentals too, and I think this might be the most exciting thing you can do. But overall, you wouldn't be able to do much in Olympic Park and the surrounding area. Good for a quick visit and photos but not for anything else."
17,5.0,I came here to see BigBang's concert in march 2016.  This place is nice to walk around and take photos.  There were street food vendors so you don't need to worry about going hungry.  For some odd reason I did not see any taxi stand and it was hard to catch a taxi since the road was gated off at the main entrance.  My other mistake was taking a taxi here to the concert at 6pm.  It was a total disaster.  Taking the subway would've been easier and faster during rush hour.
18,5.0,"I was travelling with a sports enthusiast thus we had to visit the Olympic Park. The admission is free and there is a long path with modern art sculpture. If you want to go to the Olympic Museum avoid SOMA (Seoul Olympic Museum of Art) as it has nothing to do with olympics and costs 3,000â‚© - wasted money."
19,1.0,Been there three times for a walk. Don't expect much from this park. They said they were supposed to have a roller skate area but when i came there it was completely empty and the staff just kicked me out.
20,4.0,"Despite visiting in winter, the park is well used by families and sports fans. The sculpture park has some extraordinary works in it: some inexplicable and others thought-provoking."
21,5.0,"This is a great park where you can rent bikes, tandem, or carts you peddle. There's a statue garden area that is interesting, lakes, and lots of room. There's nothing here that is must see unless you really like the Olympic areas. There's two subway stations that will take you here. I went to the wrong one to meet people and it takes about 35 minutes to walk to the other end."
22,3.0,"Very clean and when we went, early morning, almost empty.It was quit vast and you needed to walk a lot to see everything."
23,4.0,"I'd recommend a full day here, as the park is big and there's so much to see! On Saturdays lots of things are happening - gatherings, picnics, aerobic sessions - it's a lively place."
24,4.0,"It is vast and close to the Jamsil district. Use line 8 on the underground and get out at Mongchontoseong station.Built for the 1988 Olympic Games, still has a flame and all of the flags are up too. The park, skillfully landscaped and complete with lakes, waterfalls and modern sculptures, can be explored on double bikes or 4 biker-seats and hired by the hour for a reasonable price. In the space of one hour, you can go round and see most of it on one of these contraptions whilst taking photos too. I would recommend - fun and enjoyable."
25,5.0,saw a baseball game here at it was a blast. perhaps the highlight of my trip to seoul. Korean baseball is so much more fun than in US because the fans rarely sit down and every batter has his own dance cheer that the entire crowd does. awesome!
26,4.0,"Alright, so I went mainly for concerts, and so I am not sure how to review it... They keep it really clean, but there really isn't much to look at if you aren't going for a concert."
27,4.0,"The park is huge, took half a day to slowly tour around the whole place. It is good for leisure walk and relaxing mind. As you walk along the park, you will notice a lot of different sculptures and a ice skating rink (which opens in winter)."
28,5.0,This park is an ex-landfill. The hill top you can have a very wide view of Seoul. Very spacious place and good for photo taking.
29,4.0,"Went there for a Hillsong Concert. The place is just beautiful. Massive, with all these street vendors and musicians.  Love it!"
30,5.0,It's not far from Olympic stadium. There lots of beautiful places especiaaly in the autumn) Try to go there and then go to Hang river!
31,5.0,"It is nice to include this in your itinerary since it is also train stations away from other tourist destinations.  The park is clean and there are food stalls around. Dont forget to bring umbrellas, the weather can be so hot."
32,5.0,"I was staying near here with my G/F's family and enjoyed seeing ""real"" Seoul neighborhoods rather than just tourist areas.  The Olympic park is nice are to walk and the areas around it are also great to explore and see the ""real city"""
33,4.0,"Its huge. Perfect getaway from city center buzz. Didnt know it consists of so many different parks, gyms and stadiums..."
34,3.0,"well, the place is more like for local weekend outdoor activities with families and concert held at the stadium areas. family type bicycle are available for rental and it is good place for jogging and spending time with your family and sunset relaxation"
