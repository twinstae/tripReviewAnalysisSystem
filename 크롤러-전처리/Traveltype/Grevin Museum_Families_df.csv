1,5.0,"It was a warm day in Seoul on our day to visit the Palaces. We had a list of places to go to with our BTS edition of Discover Seoul Pass. This was one of the places to go to. It was cool and the place was full of figures of people we know, especially our Korean idols and famous leaders of the world.We took our time going from floor to floor and there were also other guests from our country, the Philippines. What was great about the place is that it was not just a museum of wax figures, they also had games and 3D figures you can have photo ops with. They also had a souvenir shop where we bought stuff of our idols ( G Dragon, LMH and KSH) It was a good afternoon for me and my son. We enjoyed it. We have been to a wax museum in HK but this was great because of our Kdrama and Kpop idols. Thanks Grevin Seoul, we had fun . Thanks too for sending souvenir photos through my email."
2,3.0,Conveniently located near City Hall Subway station. It was easy to find. An opportunity to meet with many movie stars around the world.especially the Korean movie stars. An interesting wax museum...there were also digital games that you can play inside.
3,4.0,"Like any wax museum, some figures look very realistic and some not.  They also have some interactive activities for guests to participate so make sure you have more time to spend inside."
4,4.0,"The Grevin Museum is pretty well known so we were very enthusiastic about visiting it. As it happened, it was raining so visiting it was the perfect activity. Firstly, the pace is huge, so wear comfortable walking shoes.We took the lift to the top floor and worked our way through each level and at each floor walked down steps to the next level.Most of the wax figures were very recognizable and the great things about this museum is that you are allowed to interact with many of the figures for taking photos as well as there being many other ways of interacting. This ensured that our children had a great time.Whilst most of the wax figures were easily recognizable, some were less so, or at least less recognizable or exaggerated in their features such as the figure of Brad Pitt which was almost not recognizable in my opinion, and also the wax statue of Lady Diana which I felt was not so good.However, the whole family did thoroughly enjoy the museum and we must have spent at least two hours inside.The museum is well located in the city centre and being very close to City Hall and across the road from the Lotto department store and Duty Free shop."
5,4.0,Really nice place to take pictures. I think that this is funny when you come in and you feel like the wax people are real people or that real people is wax people. I don‚Äôt think so that this is type of museum that you have to go there. But if you have free time pr it‚Äôs rainy day you can go there.
6,5.0,"Visited Grevin Museum ( Part of Discover Seoul Pass Free Entry) and found this to be the best valued attraction among their list of 21 free attractions.  Apart from the realistic Wax Figures, there were also some Trick Art Photo opportunities as well and some interactive games which you could play too.  Overall a very interesting Museum.  If you are looking for directions, you should download a local map navigation app called Naver and search for Geurebaeng Museum .  It will give you options to take either Bus, Metro, Taxi or Walking routes with estimated travel times and cost as well."
7,5.0,"I am used to always doing the wax museum, which is usually always Madame Thussaud, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is a museum Grevin in Korea. I was there with my little brother, there was almost no one who made the visit very pleasant. We were able to really take our time and laugh a lot. to see the stars of Kpop and Kdrama is really nice, especially for the fans."
8,3.0,"Celebrity sightings...well, in 'wax'.  Fun to walk about life-like statues of historic and contemporary celebrities.  It's a quick visit."
9,5.0,The best way to be close from your idolsüòÇüòÇüòÇ had a lot of fun with my family and we took hilarious pictures!
10,5.0,We passed by the Grevin on our way back to our hotel. They have celebrities for all ages and lots of interactive games for the young and old. We had a great time with the realistic wax figures. Fun afternoon!
11,4.0,"We went there since our daughter wanted to see the Korean wax museum up close and personal! Not a bad place to visit. You should get the Discover Seoul Pass if you wanted to visit this museum so that it would be worth the money paid. Lots of wax artists or celebrities to see. We have been to the actual Madamme Tussaud in London so it is nothing compared to the real ones. The only different is you can catch the glimpse of the famous Lee Minho. Overall not a waste but then if you just want to visit the museum & pay the entrance fees of KRW18,000 then it is not worth it!"
12,5.0,"Grevin Museum is composed by four floors. Each room has a theme and with it a matching sound  and light system, making the experience all the more realistic and engaging. After you buy your ticket you will be instructed by the staff to take the lift to the top floor and then you move your way down to the beginning area. Always keep your ticket at hand. You will need it to activate the interactive games and activities throughout your visit. You will be able to play the roulette with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, a basketball match with Michael Jordan, attend a class in which Steve Jobs and Einstein will be your teachers, take a photo in Andy's Warhol studio, land  the presidential airplane with Leo DiCaprio guidance, learn the process of how to make a wax figure and morph your face with one of your favourite celebrities in the beauty salon. Some of these activities will give you the possibility to send the end result to your email if you wish to do so.The 4th floor starts with a  walk on the red carpet. Prepare yourself for the clapping and paparazzi and to be greeted by Hallyu celebrities. After you indulge them in taking a selfie with you, keep walking. In no time you will find yourself surrounded by Hollywood stars from the Ocean's Thirteen, E.T. and  The Godfather among others. On the same floor you will meet Korea's greatest: King Sejong, Saimdang Shin (the first woman to appear in a Korean bank note), Admiral Sun Sin Yi, Yi Hwang and Yi IInventors such Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci and people who dedicated their life to peace and human rights such as Pope Francis, Ghandi and Nelson Mandela are also present.The 3rd floor is composed by world leaders, athletes and artists. It is also where you will be able to land the presidential aeroplane after you scan you ticket and discover the magic behind the wax figures creation, the ‚ÄúDiscovery Atelier‚Äù.The ‚ÄúDiscovery Atelier‚Äù is amazing. You will be able to see how those super detailed and life like figures were created. You can even follow the steps that were needed to create G-Dragon (Korea's music idol) wax figure to create your own 3D model throughout their activities. While there, you will learn that it takes months to create a wax figure, that they all have natural hair, eyes made of glass and that their teeth are created by a dental specialist. Some of the wax figures are dressed in clothes donated by their models from their own wardrobe. On the 2nd floor you will find famous actresses, world renowned fashionistas and the Hall of Fame, which is also the main hall of Grevin Museum and where you will find Psy, G-Dragon, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Mike Jagger to name a few.From then on you move to the recording studio where you will meet John Lennon, Luciano Pavarotti and Sumi Jo.The visit ends on a K-Drama set titled ‚ÄúHallyuwood‚Äùsurrounded by some of the most famous Hallyu actors and actress like Lee Min Ho, Park Shin Hye and Hyun Bin.If you have kids, do not worry. They will not be bored since they can interact with the wax figures and also participate in the activities. Mine loved the aeroplane simulator, the 3D creation of herself, to ride a bike alongside E.T., play a basketball game with Michael Jordan and try the quiz given by Steve Jobs and Einstein. Actually she loved everything. The problem was to leave the museum.Grevin Museum is open all year round. Has a gift shop and a Cafe.Its at walking distance from the City Hall if you are farther than that take the subway. The stop is Euljiro 1-ga, Exit 1 ( follow the sidewalk for about 3 minutes. The museum will be on your right side)Make sure you take your camera with you ready for action. Once you get in you will become a happy trigger kind of photographer."
