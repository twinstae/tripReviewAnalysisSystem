0,5.0,"Took a while to find, but itâ€™s basically to the left of Daehanmun. Just walk down the path and you see a City Hall building to your left. Walk towards it and there will be signs pointing you to the observatory. The view here is great and there is not a lot of people even on a weekend. While you do not have to purchase drinks when at the site, it will be polite to do so (the tea is pretty cheap at 2000KRW)."
1,5.0,"This is a nice little spot on the 13th floor inside Seosomun building in downtown Seoul, that is getting more popular as it gets known. When we went on a weekday afternoon about 1 plus pm, it was crowded with people who were there to get a lunchtime drink and views of Deosukgong.Basically, the cafe is open every day, and it closes at 9pm on a weekday and at 6pm on weekends. The cafe staff didn't seem to mind visitors walking in to enjoy the views even without buying any drink. Although there is not much standing space when it is crowded and therefore not good to stay for long.There are also photos on the wall of Seoul and Korea in the early 20th century, so it is a nice memory lane for those interested in the history of Seoul.Highly recommended attraction especially during autumn season, when one can take in the beautiful pictures of Deosukgong in the backdrop of the red and yellow coloured trees."

3,5.0,"This attraction is a bit hard to find, and only open on weekends, but it gives you an amazing view of the centre of Seoul right from it's heart. If you go down the road that goes from the left of the main entrance to Deoksugung Palace you will see a large building on your left, a little back from the main street. This is the Seoul City Hall Annex (it looks closed at the weekends but don't be fooled!) and if you go towards it and head to the side entrance to the right hand side of the building you can get into the building, do through the turnstiles and take the elevator up to the top floor where you are greeted with a little coffee bar and an amazing view.I much prefer this view of Seoul to the view from Namsan Tower, because here you are much closer to the action, and you can admire the varied and historical buildings of Jeong-dong as well as the palace buildings of Deoksugung, the new and old Seoul City Hall Buildings and the majestic mountains in the distance.This place is good for couples and informal meetings and has disabled/wheelchair access.The drinks sold at the little coffee bar are not bad and good value. There is also a small selection of hand picked souvenirs. It's good for a cold day and amazing any time of year."
