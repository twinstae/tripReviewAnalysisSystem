0,5.0,Interesting modern art museum in an interesting building.  The installations make excellent use of the space - for example bathroom themes in old bathrooms- and fit well.  Watch your head - some of the ceilings are low.Eat at the coffee shop next door and get a discount on admission.
1,5.0,"Arario might be one of my favorite museums in the world. The art contained inside is beautiful, intriguing, and many pieces are by world-renowned artists, but it's the space itself that really drew me in. The narrow nature of the building encourages unexpected, intimate views of the pieces, while its windows also frame interesting views of the surrounding neighborhood. The gift shop is cool too, offering all sorts of cool things by artists you won't find elsewhere. Highly recommend for a quiet afternoon in Seoul."

The building is absolutely beautiful and amazing to walk through. The exhibits were bizarre! One of the goals of modern art I believe is to make you feel uncomfortable and this museu certainly gets the job done."
