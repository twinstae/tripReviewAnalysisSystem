0,4.0,I was here and soul on business so I wanted to grab a quick bit to eat.   This place came highly recommended by all the locals and some of the other visitors that were staying at my hotel. Your dad a couple of the different dishes cause I was going to take one back with me to eat later and both were delicious. They were fresh for the blue well-made season perfectly and I will definitely be back as long as I am here. Great place to try one in the area
1,4.0,"A place to down a bottle or two of soju ( 20% alcohol ) with a set meal, approximately 7,000W per grilled fish, served with rice, miso soup and pickles. Very fast and friendly service."
2,3.0,This is one of the best places for street food I found in Seoul. Since the location is quite central it's easy to reach.Close to the large fashion shopping mall and the Dongdaemun Palace.
3,5.0,"No frills, no fuss - just great grilled fish amidst the hustle and bustle of the Dongdaemun area. The alley is easy to spot as it is lined with grilled fish restaurants. Unclear of which is the best, I just went into one randomly and found it to be tremendously good. The mackerel I ordered was perfectly grilled and served with rice and a selection of sides.To get there, take the Subway Line 4 (Blue Line) to Dongdaemun Station and exit from Exit 9. Walk straight for about 200 meters and then turn left after the IBK Bank. A few more meters down the road (which is lined with vendors selling all kinds of snacks); and the grilled fish alley would be on your right."
