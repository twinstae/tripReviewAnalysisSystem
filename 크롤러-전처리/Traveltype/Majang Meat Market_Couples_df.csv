The beef was soo delicious and at the price we paid, it was well worth every penny! We highly recommend the shop we purchased our beef from, the lady was super nice and helpful!"
1,5.0,We were told about Majang Meat Market by friends and we really wanted to visit.  We went on a weekday afternoon and it seemed as if there would not be anything to eat.  The stalls were open and the restaurants upstairs seemed empty.We were prepared to return another day when we saw a restaurant with a lot of people eating.  We went up and were asked if we had bought the meat.  We said no and the staff got a guy to bring us down to the shop to choose our meat. We chose 530 grams of sirloin and 330 grams of striploin (total was 92000 KRW).  We wanted to order more but the guy said that what we had ordered was more than enough.Little did we know but the guy was actually the boss of the restaurant.  He was kind enough to help cook the meat and even recommended a plate of raw beef for us to eat.Do look out for this restaurant......Majangdong Hanwoo Town Charcoal Grill Meat Restaurant.
2,5.0,A near city center local meat market which is worth to visit. Many Packed high grade BBQ beef provide by the meat shops which also guide you to restaurant nearby to cook and enjoy immediately.Price is reasonable. Don't miss it if you really want to taste real Korea beef.
3,4.0,"It's a local meat market, which itself is sort of a sightseeing spot?! First, you got to buy the meat from the stall, you can choose from any stalls. Then, the staff will guide you to the eating area upstairs. Upstairs area charged 5000 won per person. Offering not only the service, but also the appetizers (i.e. Kimchi and all the small dishes, 'free flow') and free wifi. You can order beers, cokes, rice, cold buckwheat noodle, etc, which of course with additional cost. We actually didn't compare the price with other Korean bbq restaurants, so can't comment on whether it's cheaper than outside or not. But, it's a nice and local experience."
4,4.0,"We visited the 石信韓牛. You can buy the freshly cut 1++ loin there, and have BBQ upstairs. The BBQ place just charged 5000won per person for serving you with BBQ stove and many delicious side dish and veggie for wrapping the beef.Very nice experience there. Costs us just ard 60000 won over there for two persons, much cheaper than the Korean BBQ in city centre of Seoul/HK. One thing not very comfortable is that, the entire market is full of raw meat and their organs, Amitabha."
