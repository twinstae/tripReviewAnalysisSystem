Mostly ladies boutiques, others like socks, HP covers, shoes,  cosmetics, men clothes etc. It's basically 2 rows of shops parallel to each other, walk 1 side then u-turn & walk the other side.Somewhere u will find a bread shop, the corn cheese bread is yummy! this underground shopping is link to Shinsegae shopping mall. Good to shop here when weather is too cold to stay outdoor at nite."
2,5.0,We came across this underground shopping center accidentally and was blown away by its massive amount of shops. The shops seem to be endless on both sides. We spend a whole day shopping here and brought many stuffs. Had to stop my wife from buying more stuff as we had too many bags to carry.Came back 2nd day to continue the quest for cheap stuff. Cloths here are decent and cheap. Maybe the cheapest in Seoul.
3,5.0,This underground shopping mall located at Express Bus Terminal train station. It a long stretch shop and what ever item you can find in Myeong Dong or Dongdaemun you can find it here & much cheaper price !!
