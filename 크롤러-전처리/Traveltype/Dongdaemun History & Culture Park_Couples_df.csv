0,3.0,"This was our second visit to Seoul and I had been researching for new and interesting places to visit, the area around Heunginjimun Gate has lots to offer. In one direction is the Seoul City Wall and Museum and in the other Dongdaemun History and Culture Park.  This is a very interesting landmark which was built on the former Dongdaemun Stadium built by the Japanese during Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1920s.  We came to check out the amazing architecture of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) and to explore the park all free to the public.  During the redevelopment of the sight ancient relics and sections of the city wall were uncovered and can be seen as you wander around. At the back of the DDP are gardens and a very interesting LED flower garden art installation which at night light up."

2,5.0,it's ok but don't expect much as far as cultural or the so called museum it's more of shops and restaurants and dedicated to fashion but a nice place to watch people and relax
3,5.0,"Centered with an amazing plaza (Dongdaemun Design Plaza) there is much to see in terms of history, culture, shopping, and eating.  DDP has all this already, but the surrounding area offers even more."
4,4.0,"Clean and peaceful environment.  A session of the city wall is preserved and on view here.  LED roses are lit at night and is hugely popular with couples.  The DDP building looks great although I would prefer taking its pics at twilight.  Literally right opposite from Migliore, Doota and Maxlyte, the major shopping buildings in the area."
