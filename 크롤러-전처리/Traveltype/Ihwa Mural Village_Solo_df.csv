Itâ€™s a great walk up and you can include a visit to the Wall Museum, which is interesting and entrance is free. The village itself is just a good place to wonder around and explore some is the small shops, galleries or just look at the street art. Good for photographers."
1,4.0,"While searching the web for places to explore in Seoul, I chanced upon this interesting village and decided to make a trip here. As expected, there are many murals of colourful designs spread over the village or rather a town. There are signs recommending a specific route and murals to look out for.Visitors are reminded to keep their voices down and the place clean when visiting this place in considerations of the residents living there. Apparently they were so upset with the noises that they disfigured the flowers and koi fishes mosaic on the staircases."
2,5.0,"This was a super unique experience in Seoul! I loved the opportunity to wander aimlessly, and discover lots of interesting shops and views! The street art is fun and offers great opportunities for social media posts. ðŸ˜‚"
3,5.0,"I really liked walking around here. There is lots to see and it wasn't crowded at all, even though I was there on a Sunday afternoon. Be aware that some parts are very steep."
4,4.0,The village located at the top of the hill near by Naksan park.  It has a beautiful art wall around the village.
5,4.0,"There are lots of nice murals here. They are located in different places, and not in one street. Two of the murals are no longer in existence as they were painted over. There are cafes.. quaint cafes all around! Really nice! There is also a souvenir shop, with a red scooter outside as props. Lots of nice costume jewellery there. Awesome service too. As you walk, do keep your voices down. It is a residential estate. I have attached on the directions i used. Basically, just walk towards Naksan Park. You will see it.There are awesome view at the top of the village."
6,4.0,"This place is like the Gamcheon Mural Village in Seoul. It's not as artsy as Gamcheon but it's quite good with beautiful paintings and art landmarks. You need to hike to see the fullest. They have maps that show special paintings or landmarks of the village. Special or you can say beautiful landmarks located at a  high level so get ready for a long hike. At the top of the mountain (just like Gamcheon, Ihwa is located at Mt. Naksan) you can find part of Seoul City Wall as the wall also cross the Mt. Naksan, Seoul city, and DDP from afar. There are cafes, small souvenirs shops, some street food stalls, and hanbok rental shops. You can buy a cup of coffee to enter one of the cafes and enjoy the view from the balcony."
7,5.0,This place is really amazing! Great for people that loves art and likes to work out. Good views of Seoul can be seen while you go up the village. The City Wall is around as well. Lots of coffee shops and souvenirs can be found as well. One of the best spots to take pictures in all Seoul
8,5.0,"There are many murals drawn on the sides of people's houses. As the name says, it is a village. Therefore be sure to keep quiet when exploring the area. There is also some mini workshops, cafes and museums around the village, The village is also situated at Naksan Mountain, so make sure to wear proper footwear and clothing as there will be a hike up to the village and high stairs along the village"
9,4.0,"Cute place to spend an afternoon. There were not as many murals as I had expected, but there were some really nice ones. Fun to watch all of the local tourists taking loads of selfies. Lots of cute cafes & shops throughout the village. Some nice views of the city from nearby as well. Great way to spend a few hours!"
10,5.0,"Well worth the climb. Plenty of cute art pieces and cafes. On the way to the village, you can get a great view of Seoul. I went around sunset and it was spectacular!"
11,4.0,"With most tourist attractions and museums in Seoul closed on Monday, this might be a good alternative if you want to get out and explore the city.  I reached it from the Dongdaemun area walking along the Old City Wall heading toward Naksan Park.  While it is an uphill climb, to me it looked easier than the people arriving at Ihwa from below and having to traverse many steps.  As others have posted the two most well known murals painted on the staircases were vandalized and are no longer visible, which is really a shame.  There are some smaller murals and other sculptures like cats, roosters, and balloons that were fun to look at.  The view over Seoul also is nice with Namsan tower in the background.  There were a few shops, coffee houses, and restaurants too, although I really didn't stop at any of them except for one shop that also had a small museum that while closed the proprietor allowed me to take a look--that is where I saw what the destroyed murals (one of fish the other flowers) looked like.  Ihwa is a bit like the Gamcheon Culture Village in Busan but on a much smaller scale.  Right next to Ihwa is Naksan Park and I enjoyed the tranquility of the paths there as well as the city views and the views of the old city wall.  Altogether I probably spent about two hours exploring and taking pictures of both Ihwa and Naksan and would recommend this as something different to do in Seoul and a bit off the beaten path."
12,4.0,"Although it's quite a steep walk up the hill, it's worth the fantastic view, tons of nice little cafÃ©s/bars sipping on a drink/coffee while watching busy Seoul..."
13,2.0,Most of the most famous pieces are gone now. There are a few left that have been scrubbed away or scribbled over as well. However! A lot of cute cafes and little stores are littered throughout the area and are very fun to visit. The town is lovely and pretty to walk through.
14,5.0,"This is officially one of my favourite places in Seoul now. It's such a hidden gem! Was recommended to visit Ihwa-dong mural village by my Korean friends and I'm glad I did! Came here alone and was rewarded with a beautiful view of the city as well as the art murals. Mt. Naksan is located at the tip of Ihwa-dong Mural Village too. For those interested to visit, it's best to walk from Hyehwa station (line 4, exit 2), turn in at the alley next to Dunkin Donuts and continue walking straight up. You will eventually see a map of Ihwa-dong Mural Village."
15,5.0,"Walked around this area on a cold and rainy day. Not a easy hike up to the village but doable from subway station. The lazy way is to catch a taxi up to the top of the hill and walk down to get a glimpse of all the street arts and murals. There are many restaurants, cafes and ma/pa convenience stores if you get tired/hungry. This is a residential neighborhood so don't be loud or litter."
16,4.0,A lot of beautiful mural arts along the way up hill. This places used to be the location of many K-Dramas.
17,4.0,"Went for a walk at this Cultural district to see the many mural art done by the various artists. Best to visit during weekdays and earlier part of the morning. Be prepared to walk and climb the narrow steep steps. I simply love doing it when weather was nice at 10 degrees with lovely sunshine and lesser crowd.Quaint little village which I find interesting and not too touristy yet. Those artists and home owners have done a great job to revamp the area. Great place to visit for those  who have the time to spare, an estimated  leisure 2 hours walk and strong legs of course."
18,5.0,"I went a bit late, at around 4pm as an afterthought, but it turned out to be the best decision. Sure, images turned out a little dark, but as much as I like novelty shots against murals, the views of Seoul took my breath away.The setting sun cast a romantic glow across the streets lined with trees and quaint little houses. There are many signs warning for tourists to keep quiet because there are still people living in the houses, and I saw quite a number of high school students returning home after school.Great for a glimpse into the local life, to beef up your travel album (obligatory winged shot!), to get a bird's eye view of Seoul, and for a nice, relaxing hike. The stairs can be very steep- not for elderly people or those with injuries. Wear comfortable shoes!"
19,4.0,"Raring to see a laid back part of Seoul , then head to Hyewa towards Ihwa Mural Village , past Marronier Park. Murals along the walls of houses actually lived in by the locals. You get a peek into how they live and at the same time get a good view of Seoul. Having the chance to walk along a part of the Seoul Fortress wall is an added thrill."
20,5.0,Artistic place good for taking photos and nice place to walk. Also a good spot to get to see a bird's eye view of Seoul.
21,5.0,"Ihwa Mural Village is an adorable place in the middle of Seoul. Actually, it doesn't feel like you're in Seoul at all. The murals are adorable, but look out for couples with their selfie sticks! And be sure to check out Naksan Park on your way!"
22,3.0,"i've spent 1-2 hours searching for murals in narrow streets of ihwa and taking pictures..take the metro to hyehwa station and go out at exit-2. From there, you need to go east and somehow you' ll spot the place nearby the naksan park..I cannot say, the artwork is spectacular, but if you hapve extra time to spend, it may be an interesting option..Average.."
23,5.0,"The murals here are great, but I definitely recommend climbing up the alleys and side streets as well to get to the top and enjoy the breathtaking view of the city from Naksan Park. I really enjoyed climbing up the side streets and alleys because you get to see the way the locals live. It's a unique look of the shanty houses. A real treat for photographers.Definitely recommend checking out the area around the subway station as well. There are Makgeolli (korean rice wine) restaurants, jazz clubs, thai restaurants, and there's plenty of festivals in the warm months."
24,4.0,"I lost my way at first and finally by walking towards very steep uphill road, then I found the way, this place is something like Samcheongdongdong whereby currently still a residential area, I enjoy along the way scenery as the after snow scenery at the foot of Naksan Park really gorgeous."
