Bought a Tumi hand carry and due to bad command of English of the sales person, I became aware only after payment that I can only collect the bag in the airport. The first payment transaction had to to voided and a new charge had to be processed because the sales person made an error the first time around. Long story short, when I went to collect my bag in the airport on 27 May (approximately 9.30am) the lady that served me was rude beyond explanation. She handed the bag in a box to me and wanted me to sign off that the item was collected in good condition. I refused before inspecting the item. I asked for a cutter or scissors to open up the box, she lamely handed me and pen without uttering a single word. I asked if she expected me to unbox with a pen, she dropped the pen on the table and walked off! Such utter rudeness! If Korea wants to promote tourism, the country need to send its people fronting tourist for better training as such bad attitude in a place filled with tourists is just not acceptable! The picture below showed the unfriendly facial expression of the staff member manning the collection counter. Such a sight just put off the idea of me ever wanting to visit this country ever again. Extremely disappointed and upset with the horrendous encounter. Shinsigae, please send your staff for training so that they are more customer oriented."

I needed shoes urgently and ended up buying two pairs from Kumkang on the third floor. Tbh i was blown away by the service the staff were polite, friendly and gave me free gifts too! Tip - dont forget to ask for tax refund, you have to go to the customer service office on the 4th floor."

Promotion on some of the items were so good, you need to be mindful because it's so easy to overspend. Overall, I had such a fund time shopping!"
3,4.0,A big 10 story mall with lots of luxury brand. On the 10th floor you can find and arcade and a very nice movie theater(movies in English and Korean). The place was extremely clean. Highly recommend if you are downtown Uijeongbu and have a few hours to spend in it.

5,4.0,"If you are looking for a luxurious department store then head here, but if you are looking for a good deal then keep looking. Lots of stores and places to eat though so even if you aren't going to buy anything else go for that."
6,4.0,"Seoul has many traditional market and for sure it also has many luxurious mall, especially around Myeongdong (I do not know in other areas). Shinsegae has duty free shops and many other shops which sell things you can buy. I myself did not buy anything here, better shop at the markets which are affordable for me.I had dinner with friends here at one of Korean cuisine restaurants. I forgot the name. Shinsegae is located close to Namdaemun market (accross the street). If you have much money, just try to buy things here. But if not, then Namdaemun market can be your another option."
7,4.0,More high-end supermarket compared to lotte. Nice food stores at basement and plenty of cakes/pastries to try
8,4.0,"This is still a good department store, I just feel that if you got to Lotte Main Department store, I don't see why you'd need to go here.  My cousin in law came with us looking to buy a duty free LV belt, but they did not have LV at their duty free.  He ended up getting it at the Shilla Duty Free."
9,4.0,"This main store is located within 15mins from Myeongdong station and one practically find almost anything in this building. The immediate duty free shopping is located from the 8th floor. The lower levels provide tax refunds for tourists. If you're looking for luxury goods from international brands, this is the place to go! However, as some stores have not yet open, there's a limited selection of goods.The ladies beauty zone (on the 8th or 9th floor, I forgot), can be a real test of your determination! The salespeople are very aggressive and before you know, you might have spent a sum! You've been warned, but still a great place to get your tax free items.."
10,5.0,"A mall with popular, luxury and high-end premium brands outlet under one roof. Good for window shopping, or gift hunting!"
11,4.0,"It is really impressive its huge, clean futuristic looking and a bit intimidating. I guess you could live here if you had the money to do so!  Really it has everything quality is awesome!  However you have to pay the price it is not really cheap! The downstairs food shopping store offers all kinds of awesome food (for a price).Definetly worth a visit as a tourist you have to come and see it."
12,4.0,"What an impressive site as you approach Shinsegae.  The main store, the flagship of the chain is truly a landmark in downtown Seoul.  Located in the Myeong-dong area the beautiful structure emits an air of style, class and historic culture.  Best way to reach it is by metro light blue line 4.  Take exit 5 and walk forward.  You will see the beautiful building facing you.  Shinsegae which means ""new world"" is noted for its luxury goods with all brand names represented in the store.  My main reason in visiting was to see what was offered in the basement, usually the spot for food items and supermarket.  Not to be disappointed it was super clean, orderly and well laid out for viewing, shopping and gawking.  The products were of very high caliber as evidenced by the prices.  Does $10.00 for an apple tell you anything.  It really is eye popping to see the array of cooked and packaged goods.  It is mouth watering.  There is a supermarket and also many mini counters selling ever item imaginable.  Some of the bakeries were fabulous.  Even if you are not in the buying mood it is quite an experience to see how the rich shop.  I was somewhat disappointed, because having been in Lotte, this area was much smaller, plus I could not locate a sit down restaurant like in Lotte.  It does not compare to the size and quantity of goods available in Lotte.  It is definitely worth visiting and experiencing it.  But if time is limited, then I would most definitely visit Lotte for the shear size and scope of the area."
13,5.0,"The most luxury department store. Two wings. One wing for super luxury and the other for normal luxury. Worth to visit and see what it offers, but please note you'd feel odd if you are not well presented. Also, please make sure you visit TRINITY GARDEN on the top of department store. My friend took me here for lunch break. I never wanted to disclose this place to anyone as it's just a perfectly hidden gem in the city. Quite classy, stylish lavish cafe with high quality food and beverages to the richer. You'd feel quite odd when you are not presented properly not only in the garden but also in this part of department store. Four major artworks would obviously make you feel privileged as well. Absolutely stunning merchandising and promotional stuff overwhelm you. Very lavish life style for the richer but good to catch up with global trend. Not a place you take your kids. Not a place you'd casually and uninhibitedly visit and enjoy, but obviously much better than any other department stores if you'd like to buy any luxury goods."
