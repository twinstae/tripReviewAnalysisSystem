0,4.0,It is situated in the same building as the trick eye museum and we had a lot of fun going around. Plenty of laughs and really good entertainment. Good value and it really is unique.
1,4.0,"Inside these 4 walls contain explicit sex scenes & figurines, some in 3D. Nothing to be shy about as we are all grown-ups if you are interested in visiting it. Here again with the nude figurines, it's left to your imagination on how to pose. I like the one with the Mother giving birth to her child. This can be more humorous if the photo is taken with the woman giving birth to an adult friend? Go imagine this and visit it with a creative and open mind; you will not regret it. Sometimes it's quite humorous as we see life in reality. For 8,000 Won or about SGD $10 you need about less than 1 hour to complete the exhibits. Thankfully, children are however not allowed entry."
