They also make audience part of the experience which is always welcomed. I would definately recommend this to everyone. Wery special experience!It was also easy to understand because the story was told mostly through dancing. Plus there was a screen where you could read what is happening (in many languages). This place deserves more attention! üòä"
1,4.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this 75 minute ‚ÄúThe Palace‚Äù performance which was easy to understand and follow, in part due to the expressive acting, but also the English narrative provided on the screen to the side of the stage. Interesting folktale told with imagination and style. Wow! Such amazing dancing and percussion skills; if you have a dancer or a drummer in your family, GO to this performance because you‚Äôll be amazed at the talent exhibited. I purchased my ticket 15 minutes before showtime and got an excellent seat (the theater design is such that I don‚Äôt think any of the seats would be ‚Äòbad.‚Äô). The performers interacted with the audience in a fun and entertaining way and the pacing was fast enough that I think younger children would stay engaged. The interior was cool, which was refreshing after a hot afternoon, but might be chilly after awhile. Short walk from the City Hall metro stop. Definitely worth the $43 ticket!"

It is all dance, music and mime so there is no language issue and it is accessible to all.  At the beginning screens on each side of the stage describe the story in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese so that you know what is going to happen, and then before each scene the same screens tell you what is going to happen in that scene in the same languages.  I love Theatre in general and wanted to see traditional Korean theatre.  I found it a delight.  It is 75 minutes long with no interval, which was about the right length. I think younger children might get bored after a while."
4,5.0,"This was probably one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's like a historical K-drama come to life, but even better and more engaging. Every scene was suspenseful and kept me at the edge of my seat. As a foreigner, it was easy to follow the story as this is a non-verbal performance. Before the beginning of each scene, there were also captions (in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese) summarising the scene, allowing the audience to have a better understanding of it.The performers were also professional, passionate and extremely talented. One unique thing about this performance was the engagement of the audience at the beginning of the performance. It was like a ""game"" between the audience and the atmosphere was lively and it was fun! I find it brilliant how the performers managed to convey such strong emotions and message without verbal communication and I think the production team did a wonderful job in this performance. The whole setup was extravagant and detailed and the use of stage props also made the performance very captivating and special.For a performance that was only a short one and a half hour, I felt like I invested so much emotions and feelings into it. Seriously. Time passed so fast without even realising it. I'd say my time was well-spent and I had a great afternoon at Jeongdong Theater thanks to this wonderful performance :)Also, there were times where the performers would appear along the aisle of the audience seats and I thought that was pretty cool since you get to see them up close! Photo/video-taking was not allowed during the performance until the last 5 minutes of the performance and after the end of the performance, there's also a photo-taking session with the main characters of the performance!I highly recommend anyone in Seoul or planning to visit Seoul to watch this performance and I don't think you will regret this experience! :)"
