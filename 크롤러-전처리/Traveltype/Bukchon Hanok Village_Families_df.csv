0,5.0,This is one of the best area's to stroll through while getting a feel of the old city. The village is basically made up of Hanoks (traditional Korean houses) and little food stalls and restaurants. We enjoyed discovering this little gem by lazily walking through different by lanes.
1,5.0,"This was a lovely experience with my girls!!! We got dolled up for the traditional dresses- hanbok, going around the neighborhood.  The houses were so beautiful.  The architectural designs of each house was jus amazing."
2,5.0,"Ancient village in Seoul, where there are still residence living there. There are scouts who try to remind visitors to respect the residence and not to be loud while visiting .Many instances able pics can be taken here."
3,5.0,Visited this place on a cold Saturday. Went up to the youth cultural corps and they provided high school students to help guide you along the place. The two student guides were super informative and helped provided so much info and thus such meaning to the place. Overall it was intriguing to get a sneak preview of the lifes of these Korean officials. Especially like how they dried persimmon  and make alcohol.
4,4.0,A fine example that modernity does not have to obliterate the old world. Of note are the hanoks which have been taken over by the city govt to preserve and be used as mini-museums.
5,5.0,"This small, quaint village was a lively place to visit. It presented a lot of traditional housing and Korean day-to-day lifestyle. Although it was a bit of a hike, the people were lovely and were confidently showing us their various artworks, handmade clothes and so on. The architecture was sensational and having a Red Bean Pankake is a must-do! I would advise being cautious when bringing young children or large groups as it could disturb others and they have posters almost everywhere about remaining quiet. The village itself links into the main town which is also advisable to visit, and is nearby to other attractions."
6,3.0,It's a peaceful place to shop after visiting gyeongbokgung palace. There are tourist guides around to assist tourist. Rmb to visit Granhand shop for their local scents
7,3.0,It's easy to find the moment you are out of the subway because you will see people in costumes & costumes rental shops.Nice little area but too touristy and I find it sorry for the people living there.Many China tourists and they can be overwhelming.Remember to keep quiet and civilised when you are outside the residences.
8,5.0,"Been here last Dec 7, 2019 and the first day of snow! Totally awesome experience for us who came from the Philippines. From MTR Anguk station exit 2 and walk straight. And Red clad tourist guides were visible giving assistance. Nice traditional Korean houses to see."
9,5.0,"As u walk from the subway station towards Bukchon Hanok Village, look for the tourism ambassadors decked out in bright red uniform & hat. They will offer u a physical map and recommend a route for u to follow so that u will not be lost figuring out where to go inside Bukchon Hanok Village. The walking route is highly recommended as u get to see lots of stuff which u might miss if u cluelessly wander around."
10,5.0,We spent almost whole day here walking around. Bukchon Hanok Village is the real residential area with 900 hanoks. There are many interesting photo spots here especially when you put on the rented Hanbok!
11,5.0,A great and beautiful place to visit. You need to be quiet while walking along the area as there are people living there.
12,4.0,Very interesting to see a traditional Korean village in the middle of Seoul.  Wonderful wooden doors lead to secluded courtyards and private areas where people live. Rather steep hills await the walker. Cafés are nearby.
13,4.0,Nice to visit this kind of place that reminds the Korean Culture and History. The place is clean and tourist friendly especially the shops and cuisine near the area. Keep up the good work. Will visit again and tell our friends to visit the place. Thank you
14,5.0,"Lovely quaint place with plenty of little shops offering good food, coffee, dessert. A bit of a steep walk but wee worth it. The place gives you great photo opportunities."
15,4.0,"Personally not impressed with the visit while one do see the Korean style homes and some of the traditional arts like dyeing with natural substance, incense making etc. The center is good but not sure I will consider it as a must see"
16,3.0,"It is a good spot to view older buildings, is Hanok style. There is a popular trail that many visitors take, which makes some parts of the street rather crowded.Given that the village is sandwiched between palaces, it is nice to walk through the village after visiting one palace and on the way to the other. Overall, I found only a few spots in the village that was nice but awfully crowded. Perhaps coming earlier in the morning would have been better."
17,5.0,"We visited here and decided to dress up in traditional hanboks. They rental stores are all around and rent on an hourly basis. The village itself is lovely to tour around and get great pictures of the hanoks. I would highly recommend, esp silly if you have children, dressing up. We had a great time and it made for wonderful pics."
18,3.0,"The taxi ride from our hotel in Gangnam-gu to Bukchon Hanok was 32000 won. What makes it worse was that the Naver Map direction didn't bring us to the correct spot. We were left at the end of the street near a park and had to walk for 20 minutes looking for the old village. Well not exactly old. Its a residential area with old houses and people still live in it. Snap some pictures and good to go. One of the checklist. And oh yeah, decent amount of climbing needed especially when with kids"
19,4.0,"You'll need your walking shoes to get up there. Steep narrow roads but for those who love Korean architecture, this is a must see. Fantastic view of Seoul skyline from the top of the hill too. Breathtaking. Got to keep your voice down though because there are people living in the houses."
20,5.0,Its a very pretty housing complex to walk in small alley. The houses are very pretty!! There are 2 side areas that you can visit. If you get lost there are local guide which offering you help to reach the area.
21,5.0,"This is a MUST! to visit, this place is definitely one of the most important historic places in Seoul, you can find lots of souvenirs and also rent a traditional Hanboks dresses and much more."
22,3.0,This village is actually local residential area. There were shops that provides the traditional hanbok where tourist can walk around and take pictures. You don’t really feel welcome there as there were few protest signs on local unhappiness.
23,5.0,This Korean traditional houses are interesting and for me a must experience. The traditional villages have lots of alleys and the house have open air in the center court with rooms around it. We stayed in one of them in order to have the sleep experience. Sleeping on the futons and enjoy the close community.
24,5.0,"Great place, great atmosphere, a must visit before even other places. Need an hour to two hours minimum."
25,5.0,"Bukchon was really the only thing I wanted to see in Korea. We went on a tour and I was quite disappointed, not by the village, but by the tour guide who rushed us through. It also started pissing it down raining. I managed to get some decent shots which I have to edit, but I could have used more time. The houses are all still inhabited and are worth upwards of a million dollars each. Although the facades are required to be preserved, the interior of the houses are all very modern and updated. There's signs asking tourists to keep their voices down, no loud pictures, music or talking. I guess some rude westerners had caused problems in the past. Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well."
26,3.0,This is a cluster of Korean houses (Hanok) situated nearby the palaces in Gangbok.Most of the houses have been modernised but maintained the traditional Korean architecture design.It’s on an incline and may be a challenge for older people or parents with strollers.Generally a residential area and will have to observe general etiquette when visiting this area.
27,3.0,"Many nice traditional houses, there are so many shops and cafes on walking street. But it’s so crowded, some people talk loudly even though they have attention boards. It made us not enjoyable, although its great place to visit. Luckily we went to another part, its a short street. less people 😆"
28,4.0,"Picturesque village, can have a walk around, and look at the old style buidlings, also lots of souvenir shops and food"
29,4.0,We rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village.  It was a beautiful place for taking pictures in a hanbok. Many historic and ancient korean house there. Overall it's beautiful.
30,4.0,"It is nice to walk around the area if you are in the city. Up & down hills with ancient houses, nice small shops & restaurants, cozy cafe & design goods, this is the area worths to spend at least couple hours. Popular cafe houses, restaurants, photo taking spots & local and ancient life sightseeing can be all found.如果你在首爾，這裡肯定適合走一走，上坡下坡於老房子、很不錯的小店和餐廳、舒服的咖啡廳和設計小店，這個地方可以花個幾小時慢慢走一走，有名又受歡迎咖啡、餐廳、拍照熱點和當地又古老的生活在這裡都找得到。"
31,5.0,We visited on a Sunday morning while it was quiet. So able to walk around freely before the crowds. Amazing photo opportunities along the route. Ditch the guide book and just go for a wonder. Free museum and galleries also made for interesting tour. Steep roads in some places. What an amazing place the neighbourhood was aliving museum. Well worth the 3.8mile walk.
32,5.0,"Cobble line streets, historical neighborhoods, swanky cafe's, eateries, easy access by metro, quaint neighborhoods make this one of my top destinations in Seoul."
33,3.0,"it is very tiring to climb all the hills just to get to the photo scenic spots, but i think they're worth it..? the view is really nice. on the base of the path there are some shops around too. i wouldn't go again, but once is good enough :)"
34,4.0,"The walk through this traditional neighborhood was enhanced by visiting a home that the city had acquired and opened to visitors.  We were able to walk into the courtyard and then after removing our shoes, enter the house where 3 rooms were available to us to walk through.  In one room, traditional tables and chairs were setup on the floor but it was not so easy to sit down.  In the other rooms were displays of vases made out of wood and a person was available to answer questions.  We continued walking through the very narrow and sometimes steep streets looking at the other homes and cafes.  We also stopped by the Bukchon Traditional Crafts Experience Center which was a building that housed a number of local craftspeople who taught you about traditional Korean crafts for a small fee."
35,5.0,The area is not very big but you can get disoriented and end up going around in circles. Best to go with a local or plan your walking route well. Buildings here are beautiful and some are renovated so you can spot the difference roofing modern and original. Do look out for the beautifully hand crafted clay tiles in some of the original roof of the Hanoks. Do make a stop at the Baek Inje House in Gahoe-dong area. This is free and you can see the interior layout of a typical Hanok house. Absolutely beautiful!
36,5.0,"In this village, you will see a lot of Traditional Korean House with various model. A lot of tourist will take picture witb the background of this house. This is a must to go place if you visit seoul."
37,5.0,"Don’t miss this place. This is one herritage place with lots of thing to do. But must be quiet because this is a real village, there still have people stay here. Almost shops will close at 5 pm. Reccommend be here in the afternoon after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace."
38,3.0,"Family of 3 adults.  We would include this as a PART of your day - early or late.  Too many tourists in-between :(  However, for those tourists that hire the Hanbok costume … and to see them here... adds for thinking of what it might used to be like in the old days: 600 years ago!  Also, just South nearby, is a restaurant called Warm Kitchen, Share Kitchen (opposite the Library and just beyond Pink Butter café in Samcheong-ro 2-gil Road - where you will see a man in a Panda costume to entice you in: don't be put off!) which was a very tasty place for a quick lunch and good value :)"
39,3.0,"We got lost searching this place, even when we asked around and was using the Google maps. It was beautiful but a bit crowded. Not really a ""must-see"" in my opinion, but the houses looked beautiful."
40,5.0,"This year we choose spring for our vacation.It was our 2 yrs wishlist and this year we found it by walking from myeongdong area and if we knew it was not far from our hostel stayed back in 2017..We rented a hanbok & we can walk along the area with our hanbok,why not right?Our hanbok this year i can say it was more pretty that our hanbok we wore at Ihwa Mural Village back in 2017 🤭🥰"
41,5.0,It is a lovely residential are with beautiful houses on every street and corner. Here you can see people wearing Hanboks (you can rent them from the shops nearby) walking around. Take a nice leisure stroll along these lanes and you will see the beautiful architecture of these old houses. You will also find delicious and cheap fresh fruits and local sweets sold from a truck. I didn't want to upload pictures of people's homes in respect of their privacy.
42,5.0,This is a beautiful village with ancient architecture and traditional house of Korea.Beautiful place to have good photos.You should visit here early morning because of crowed people.
43,3.0,It's a residence area. Better come here on early morning because so many people come here to take photos. People shd be quiet if visit this area. Only 1 alley which famous with its hanok house and so many people took photos here with hanbok. But nice to walk around this area and took some photos with hanok style house using hanbok or not. The road is quite step. So it's not for elderly people. Also near to changdeokgung palace.
44,4.0,"i take my kids here to learn the traditional house of Korea, a lots of wonderful home to see, even some of we can't take a picture of it"
45,4.0,this place is not really a tourist place but Koreans actually stillare living privately in this place. It is a good place to see the old way of life and culture. You need to be very quiet when visiting this place. Nice for picture taking.
46,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is pretty much close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. After visiting the palace, you can walk yourself to this heritage village with ease.PROS:-Paved road going to the village. If you’re bringing kids in strollers, it will be easier.-Since this is located in a residential area, even if there’s a lot of visitors, you will feel the quietness of the area. -Tourism staff are everywhere in case you lose your way. You’ll also see them bringing placards reminding everyone to be quiet.-You will also see a lot of souvenir shops in the area. Some food stalls too in case you need something to munch in.CONS:-There’s nothing much to do other than take photos with the old houses as your background-Tourists flock to the area on a daily basis so be prepared to get your way to get good photos-If you’re bringing a car, there’s not much parking space available as the alleys are really narrow. Street parking is not a good idea.-Get yourself ready for a lot of walking.Will I go back to Bukchon again? Probably not but it’s always good to see these types of heritage at least once."
47,4.0,"Place to visit while in Myeongbokgung palace, you can walk or take the bus to the village. They have good restaurant, authentic korean food. Try Beef Bulgogi, chicken soup, and kimchi fried rice."
48,5.0,It was our first afternoon in Seoul and we wandered around here for a few hours in the spring sunshine. Although it is allegedly closed on Sundays it certainly wasn’t. Many a Korean here dressed in hanbok’s added to the scenes. It may not be suitable for those with walking difficulties as much of it is up and down hills.
49,5.0,"Despite the crowds, this is a lovely place to visit. Seeing the architecture and knowing the history of the area makes it worthwhile. Finish the visit with a pleasant spot of tea at a traditional tea house."
50,5.0,Not necessary to wear your rented Hanbok here but is was gorgeous as easy enough to get to from main palace. This is the place to find a tea house.  Sorry that I did not mark the location or name of tea house but the owner mentioned that the home is her inheritance. The teas were excellent and this is a lovely strolling area.
51,5.0,This is embarrising but pretty. We ate in the village then we put dresses. Even  onni suri she weared the hundok.
52,4.0,This is a very well kept ancient village that was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty. It is a very pictureque place for photos as it is set on on small hill overlooking the fringe of the city.
53,3.0,"I have brought my family to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand. This Bukchon Hanok Village is average compared to the other places my family has been. My kids took minimal photos..."
54,5.0,Came on a quiet cold morning and there were plenty of photo opportunities. Just walk around to enjoy the views and soak in the atmosphere.
55,4.0,We walked around this traditional Korean village. The area is vast and as such a lot to see. You will be able to see traditional Korean houses back in the olden days. Overall a nice area centrally located. You will also find a lot of locals and tourists dressed up in traditional Korean outfits. It’s a place kids will also enjoy walking around.
56,2.0,I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place. Only for photostop around the korean houses and there are many shop for rental hanbok and some souvenir shops
57,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a quiet Korean traditional village.  It has long history and composes of tight alleys, traditional yet beautiful houses.  However, the village is still houses to many Koreans so there's a lot of signages requesting the tourists to keep the noise level down.  Do also note that the alleys are quite steep so may not be suitable for the elderly to visit this place. Overall, a beautiful place to visit but remember to keep your noise level low."
58,2.0,"Not as exciting as I hoped it would be, but it was December and the middle of Winter, which also made it unpleasant.The architecture and village layout is fascinating, but unless we missed the right spots and location, there was not much to see.Please research before you go."
59,4.0,we toured this village and went thru the whole village with its peaceful courtyard. we learnt of its history. highly recommend
60,4.0,"A hilly neighborhood with hundreds of traditional houses or hanoks bating back to Joseon Dynasty, this Bukchon Village which is in the north-central part of Seoul lies between Gyeongbok and Changdeok Palace. Though most of these Hanoks have been converted into tea houses, restaurants or guest house, art galleries, some are still held privately. Lot of efforts have gone into these hanoks to keep the original form intact. The village also has an old well called Seokjeong Full Moon well which in ancient times was the main source of water for the entire village. It is believed that this well provided clear good drinking water only for fifteen days and unclear water for the next fifteen days. The village women is said to have also believed that drinking this water helped them to bear a male child.Not to be missed, the attraction requires lot of walking so for those your are regular walkers  may find it a bit difficult here.This place can be easily reached thru the city bus or metro. The visit to this place can also be clubbed along with G Palace."
61,4.0,Reachable via metro orange line and off at Anguk station and about 10-15 minutes walk north and you won’t miss the place. It’s crowded and hard to take a good photo but if you’re lucky it’s a nice nostalgic place especially if you’re wearing their traditional hanbok dress! Be Very careful when you rent the dress since every additional ornament is chargeable. People are warned not to make to much noise since the place is actually residential but most tourists can’t resist making loud voices! It is advisable to come here during week days to avoid over crowding.
62,3.0,"Maybe because there were just too many tourists when we were there to take any nice photos. However, still interesting to know that these traditional houses actually have residents staying inside."
63,4.0,"Old heritage house built hundred years ago . Close to the palace where still have the residents live in. Good location for many tourists to change to korean costume and take picture in this village. Nothing really big deal to me once you have visited to china. However, too many through out the year and hard to talk a good pictures in my view.."
64,4.0,"You get to spend approx 1.5-2hrs to see local traditional houses.Besides, you can rent the Hanok from the shops and take some nice photos.Along the way, you can get see the high school featured in goblin Korean drama"
65,4.0,"Do take your time to explore the neighborhood. Wonderful architecture and feel of the place is amazing. Plenty of nice eateries. But do be respectful as you walk around the residential area. People still do stay in those houses. Being Respectful includes not talking at the top of your voices. Seriously, no one enjoys having so many tourists /outsiders thronging your front yard whole day long.."
66,4.0,"This is a village with traditional houses beautifully conserved. These are both owner-occupied as well as converted into shops selling jewellery, souvenirs and restaurants.  You can also get a walking map of the Bukchon Hanok Village from the tourist centre nearby. Definitely worth a visit. Do note that the elderly and those who have difficulty in walking will find this place challenging."
67,5.0,A nice photographic view of traditional Hanok houses. Not allowed to make noise as this is still housing area to some.
68,3.0,"Although it is considered as an iconic historical dite in Seoul, the truth is that this street is quite overrated, crammed with tourist, and the people living in this area are so tired of tourist visiting this street that they have posted “keep quiet” and “do not come in” signs all over the street.The whole visit is uphill so, if taking a stroller or wheelchair along for the ride keep this in mind.The ice cream shop at the first turn of the street, near the entrance, is quite good."
69,3.0,A really lovely area in Seoul where you have traditional Korean architecture.A wonderful place to go for shopping and eating. We just strolled about and tried out some of the superb Korean bakeries.Easy to get to on the metro.
70,4.0,A nice place to see because it is surrounded by high rise building.  Hanok village is a traditional korean house.  You can feel korean tradition in this place.
71,3.0,This showcase village depicts ancient korean life with mannequins in an old setting. It's free admission but the entrance is a bit difficult to find.  We stumbled upon it.
72,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential place with beautiful old houses. It is quite a walk from the train station and still an uphill walk to see the houses. Walking there, you'll pass by mamy shops with interesting souvenirs and other items. You can also rent a traditional outfit for a little cost.There were several tea houses in the village.The houses were beautiful and reminiscent of the olden times. It just feels quite wrong to walk around a village where private people still actually live. Tourists are not too welcome there, as evident in the signs around.We stayed for less than 10 minutes and left."
73,5.0,"I love the cleanliness of bukchon area. You can easily find a good spot to take a picture. Get your phone or camera and take a selfie 😁You can rent hanbok, a traditional Korean dress with 12K - 15K WON for an hour and feel like a truly Korean 😉But remember dont make any noise coz actually this village is residential area.Not far from this area you can find many cafes and restaurant where you can eat to fill your empty stomach after strolling around the area or just have a cup of coffee or tea to reboost your energy."
74,5.0,We enjoyed walking through the streets of the village and seeing the traditional houses.  We appreciated the presence of tourist information officers who guided us and even gave us a map to find restaurants.
75,5.0,Beautiful village indeed to walk around. But please keep your voices down around this residential area. You definitely won't like flocks of noisy people at your door front everyday. I heard that the residences there actually requested their government to ban tourists from entering that area due to some rude tourists actually go knocking the doors and entering their premises without permission.Please behave so that more people can enjoy the beautiful walkways of Bukchon.
76,5.0,"This is actually a residential area of the locals, you will see some aunties standby at the road side to make sure every visitors are keeping their voice down and not to distribute the residents. Some road ups and downs so wear comfortable shoes because it actually involved a lot of walking including slopes and downhill road. There are shops provide renting of traditional Korean costumes, it is indeed a nice place to take photos with the costumes on."
77,4.0,"We have spend too much walking on the first 2 day hence not really enjoy the view here. The scenic is nice if taking picture with Hanbok. Else it just a tourist place with some many selfie stick on your photo session. But, a short walk after lunch is nice."
78,4.0,"The narrow streets and traditional roof design gives you a feel of an old Korean community, perhaps of the nobility class because of the house sizes and hilly location. Because of the large number of tourists who flock this area, the community is less welcoming as shown in their street banners/signs Tourist guides also warn tourists not to talk loudly so as not to disturb residents. Still worth visiting."
79,5.0,"Loved walking around this suburb. Charming traditional houses, galleries, art & craft shops, fashion.You can obtain a local map from the information volunteers around (dressed up in red) or walk around."
80,5.0,I loved Bukchon Hanok... it can make you travel in time. But be ready to walk into sloping streets. Definitely worth the exercise.
81,5.0,"walk along these streets and the rustic feel welcomes you.  Thought i assume some or most of these houses have been revamped recently, the rustic feel is still there. clean and fresh feeling."
82,4.0,Local residents disapproved Bukchon become tourist attractions in Seoul because of the noise and damaging effect from tourist. Many houses isn't intended for tourist. Need to be very quiet when visiting this place.
83,5.0,"If I could, I would get myself a house there. It was nestled in those uphills with unique designs. The houses looked old but with a touch of modernism. Make sure you go visit it. But please, be silent while admiring this gem."
84,4.0,"It is uphill streets lined with traditional houses. It was nice to take pictures of the traditional houses. If you visit here, be aware that the residents strongly discourage the presence of tourists. They see them as a nuisance. So please be quiet when you are here. There is a hanbok rental shop at the beginning of the street."
85,5.0,"A ""Must Visit"" place. One of the nicest places to visit in Seoul and... it's free!!! It is very busy with tourists so go as early as possible in the morning if you want to enjoy it all by your selves! But as it is not an actual ""touristic place"" by choice and people still live their daily lives in their homes, please be respectful and quiet. It is always mentioned on other reviews as well but it was sad to see that a lot of tourists did not respect that. It goes without saying that having your camera or phone camera is essential! Lot's of great photo opportunities."
86,3.0,"Good to see all the streets of Korean housing, people do live here so bear that in mind. The roads are VERY steep so not for those who struggle with that."
87,5.0,"These are traditional Korean Houses back from around 600 years ago.  There are many small alleyways, and long roads for great pictures.  I came here after exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Blue House, a walk away!  Afterwards, I'd highly recommend visiting the renovated courthouse, a walk away again, haha.  Also, there was a Hanok that was available to tour and explore, so that's a must!"
88,5.0,"Very nice village to visit, very traditional and very pretty and nice to walk around. Just that some areas were steep, elderly need to be careful. Very well preserved place, there are still people living there and hence pls be considerate and do not talk loudly and behave rowdy. Overall, I think it I worth a visit."
89,5.0,This is a lovely residential area which worth to pay a visit.  The houses are beautiful but we didn’t have a chance to look inside!
90,5.0,This is a must-visit place. It's very well preserved and it's like your transported back in time. It's always packed with people but you can still manage to take pictures without including them in your photos. Place is good for kids too so you may take your family here.
91,3.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is the small village in in middle of buzzling city of Seoul which keep its traditional architectural houses. If you'd like to explore the inside of houses, try not visit it in the evening because you can not go inside after 5 PM. Wearing hanbok while exploring the house will give you new experience of the real Korean village people."
92,4.0,"We strolled through this village which is well-preserved from hundreds of years ago and still has inhabitants throughout. It was OK but once you get here, there is limited observation other than externals of buildings."
93,5.0,Amazing picture worthy area but it is very picky neighbors do not like to have visitors in the area in fact there are lots of signs telling everyone they are to be quiet.
94,4.0,This is a good walk around the old Korean Village and you will see all the old houses and of course some have been converted to shops and eateries...
95,3.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is one of the last traditional villages in the ever-developing city of Seoul where you can still see cobblestone paths and traditional Korean houses. A great place to appreciate the architecture but sadly due to the high volume of tourist that visits this place, the residents are unwelcoming and there are signs telling people to keep quiet or not to take pictures outside their gates."
96,3.0,"Quite nice architecture but all doors are closed except for one or two which have been turned to shops. The street can be narrow and steep. I was surprised to see a banner that roughly says ‘No tourists please ‘ and no talking signs pasted on most doors. I guess people live inside these houses and the whole atmosphere is very quite except for those made by tourists. Despite the hot summer, some tourists are game enough to wear traditional dresses to take photos.😂"
97,4.0,"This is residential area. I admire the idea of ""showing"" Korean traditional houses (only several houses were open and allowed to be entered), but still caring for people who lives there. There were persons who standing with banner to remind all visitors to be quite and to keep the area clean. Around the village, we can find small tea house, cafe and shops."
98,4.0,It looks lovely enough but I would avoid coming here on Monday because most of the shops were closed and definitely not in late July. The heat was just unbearable and all I wanted to do was to stay indoor.
99,4.0,"We walked around lot of places to see,local restaurants, shops.Museums, and art gallery.Even a place to experience the dark, led by blind folks."
100,5.0,My daughter lives in Seoul so she took me here. It is a very charming Korean village. Many local Koreans live here. It is beautiful and if you are in the right place you can get pics of the old with the new seoul behind it. We loved walking around here.
101,4.0,"There are lots of refurbished traditional Korean houses here.  You can walk around to explore the area and it is very picturesque.  Some of the houses are converted into shops, so you can go in for a visit and take some photos.Many little shops and cafe here, so you can stop and relax, when you are tired."
102,2.0,"Perhaps it was a hot summer day, we were dehydrated and hungry, the visit to Bukchon Hanok Village was not the best experience in Seoul. We walked and walked, and came upon some small alleys with traditional houses, that was it!!! It was interesting to see many visitors, dressed in traditional Hanbok, and taking poses in the 100 degree weather. The highly rated Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant was a disappointment, too hot, lack of taste, and varieties. What menu choices? the restaurant only served one dish during our visit."
103,3.0,"The village itself is wondetful, it has beautiful plants, lovely houses, and architecture. But this is a residential area, and the residents are not happy about the tourists disturbing their peaceful neighbourhood. There are some gentle signs on the houses by the government to keep quiet, but the residents have put up flags that say: Get out, you are not welcome! These really degraded my experience, but if you talk quietly, it's definitely a must see."
104,4.0,"Visited here as part of a private tour...just me, my daughter and the guide. It's a quiet change from the larger more commercialized tours. Worth it if you have a historian as a guide. There were some locals starting to gather to protest against the large tour groups due to the noise. But there are also a lot of local shops geared towards tourists."
105,5.0,"This place is one of the best place to take picture and having an image of living in the old Korean. The houses are so pretty but when I went there, there are a few house that's under construction (which is the government help the people to maintain their house). And this place is sooo crowded. If you want to have a very good picture with less people you should come early morning."
106,4.0,"You can walk for some hours and learn more about Korea, there are nice houses, doors, little stores and coffe"
107,4.0,This village offers you a way to look into past history housing. People still live in the houses so you have to be quiet and be respectful when you are walking around. The doors in some of these homes are gorgeous! Bring an umbrella if you are coming during summer months.
108,3.0,I don’t regret going but I will probably skip this/will not recommend visiting this area to anyone. Its actually a residential area and there is a very big sign to say that tourist are not allowed in the area. I just don’t feel welcomed at all in this area. Although I know there are very nice shops/cafes in the area I just don’t feel like wandering around the village. Do not have high expectation if you go!
109,4.0,"It was fun to walk around this neighborhood, but I felt kind of guilty that people live there and have to post signs telling others to be quiet. They post it in English and what I guessed was Korean. Tourists from other parts of the world were so loud, but you can't post in every language of the world. Some fun shops crop up randomly between the homes. Beautiful homes, fun, historic feel. But tread lightly and quietly."
110,2.0,"I don’t regret going, but it was a waste of time. There really isn’t much to see or do, and the people living in the village are very vocal as to how much they hate that you are there.  In prominent display are signs specifically complaining about and admonishing tourists.  Who cares though because it’s not really a cool place to go."
111,2.0,"The walking journey from Gyeongbokgung was very tiring and hilly. Lots of tourist didn't follow the advise to keep their voice low. Noticed several posting on the wall indicated the tenant not welcoming tourist to their village.However, I enjoy looking at many beautiful doors each houses have."
112,5.0,What a great place to visit.   Spent one evening in a traditional guest home.     What a unique experience.     The whole area is really very different.   A one of a kind place to see.
113,5.0,"spent about 1 to 2 hours there.This is a residential area so do be quiet and not be a nuisance to the residents there (not all welcome the prying eyes of tourists into their personal homes)Beautiful architecture. Would recommend hiring some traditional dresses for more authentic pictures but we were too hot and sweaty to get into those.But besides just looking at the resident's houses, there isn't very much to do there. But still worth a visit.PS : There is a self-proclaimed Michelin star Ginseng Chicken soup there near the entrance. It's a fake! We tried it and were disappointed. And my husband checked the Michelin guide and it's not there!"
114,5.0,"A very quite place, beautiful architecture, it is a place as a example for traditional Korean neighborhood , please respect the local and do not make noise.You can pay and access to the observatory,It is a must during any Seoul visit, also the you can walk around the neighborhood where you can find good shops, cafe, bars."
115,4.0,"Get yourself a map before you enter the place as the road is very confusing. Luckily, there are tourist information officers with red shirt where you can spot at some places. Ask them of the famous spots so you won't waste energy to roam aimlessly.Toilets are hard to come by in the area.There are cafes and shops around, as well as some houses that are open for public free of charge.Make sure to respect the residents and do not cause any disturbance and loud noises."
116,4.0,"Interesting place with many shops, restaurants, cafes. Generally it is possible to see some street activities also. Other than all these, you can see nice traditional houses, also many art galleries.Prices in all those shops are above the average level in Seoul. Also, in my opinion, no need to join any guided tour for here, even it is free. Just good weather is required."
117,4.0,"The place is wonderful well kept and pristine, but please understand this is a residential areq where ypu are free to roam please keep quiet and dont litter in the area... the people living in the area are annoyed of the noise in the area."
118,3.0,"Visited June 2018. This is a low priority attraction.  The best part of this attraction is the del monte mango ice cream popsicle at the nearby convenience store at a street corner.  I don't remember the name of the store.  For 50 cents, it was the cheapest and best mango popsicle ice cream I've ever had.  Real mango flavor.  We looked for this ice cream popsicle every where we went in Seoul and bummed we couldn't find it anywhere else. Bukchon Son Mandu dumplings restaurant was really good too."
119,5.0,Very nice place to visit. Easy access via train. Be cooperative to the villager so that they will allow us to visit this very nice place. We rented hanbok to go around.
120,5.0,A quaint village in the heart of the city. Must see place if you want to experience traditional Korean culture and architecture.
121,5.0,"It was a nice leisurely walk we took but everywhere around the village are signs to reject tourists and signs to say keep quiet. There are residents residing in the hanoks and i think tourists are really a bother to them. So try to keep the noise level down and move along fast. Don’t take too long to snap your fotos or selfies as well. Oh this is where the drama Goblin was filmed, but I didn’t bother to go find the exact alley and wall. Was trying to move along and finish my tour asap so as not to bother the residents. If you have time and is travelling solo, then mayb you can slowly explore."
122,5.0,If you like the historical place then  you need to see here a folk village. it is very interesting to know how korean live back then.
123,4.0,Its really a sight seeing placing. Beautiful architecture and friendly business owner. U gotta walk the slopes.
124,3.0,"A decent view of old Korean houses, many which are still residences. I have a mixed feeling about this place - as much as I want to walk around and see more of these olden architectures and there are official tourism officers roaming around to help in directions, we saw banners than hinted that tourists aren't that welcomed. I can fully understand - if you are a resident, you wouldn't want to have tourists roaming in your neighborhood, taking pictures and making noises!"
125,5.0,- cultural experience we even rented Hanbok to take photos from the Hanok Village - a place where historical places / houses are preserved
126,5.0,The streets and buildings are well preserved and served as residences for the locals. A lot of photo opportunities. However the locals seem to dislike the throngs of tourists flocking to the area and have put up banners stating their displeasure with visitors.
127,4.0,Its a few streets where there are old houses. The houses are occupied and you can stand outside on the streets to see. The houses are all along the hill so you will need to climb up
128,5.0,"Do the walk to Bukchon, eat at the samgaetang ginseng chicken restaurant and sip coffee at a nice cafe"
129,4.0,"Before arriving at Bukchon Hanok Village, I thought it would be streets and streets of old traditional buildings. But for some reason, it was smaller than i expected. Maybe we also went during the summer and there were fewer tourists around. The structures are REAL houses of people inhabit and they have many signs that said ""to be quiet"". I guess they're not too fond of tourists visiting their homes. There are also plenty of hanbok renting stores outside so you can rent the costumes and have a photoshoot there. Overall, we spent about 30 minutes to an hour exploring the place."
130,4.0,If you wish to come here please get hold of a map. The map detailed the required walking route and photo point. The weather and the slope is a killer and not suitable for elderly with walking issue. There are also volunteer tourist information ambassador going round. So if you need help just ask them!
131,3.0,"This unique place is really in the heart of Seoul, Korea. We really amazed the Korean's preservation of their ancient houses which still exist to date. This is one of the place you need to visit in Seoul."
132,4.0,"Had a great wander through these streets dotted with cafes, art and boutique pieces of souvenirs. Lovely vibe and saw many people dressed in rented traditional gear strolling around here.It’s very accessible from the palace and would be a recommended stop for those interested in doing a walking tour around the area. Plenty for all ages."
133,5.0,"Such an interesting place with lovely views, many flowers, trees, old houses and some amazing activities for families and youngster. You should go in early morning to feel the peace and the stillness there!"
134,5.0,"Even though many houses are built new and people don't live in old styles, this is still amazing place to feel old times.- Fun fact is to see lots of foreign tourists trying Hanbok on.- Good to have a connected trip with Seochon, Gyeongbokgung, Insadong, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Naksan Park, Jongro Street and some other places."
135,4.0,"At the Northern edge of the city lies the traditional village of Bukchon, A must see for visitors to imagine how life was like in Seoul before the high rise apartments took over the landscape. Making the effort to walk up the hill through the small streets is worth it with great photo opportunities of the old houses with Namsan tower in the back ground. Stop for a coffee, cake, street food or try one of the many Korean restaurants for a taste of the local cuisine. While the distances are not far there are plenty of stops along the way to keep occupied for a few hours.  On weekends start early and plan for lunch there. Evenings are also good but can get busy. We went with 10 YO boys and it was fine."
136,2.0,Residence here are suffering with tourist. You better explore other place. Nothing special here just make you & your feet fatigue. Trust me.
137,4.0,"Nice neighbourhood to walk around since the houses are mostly the traditional houses. Be prepared for an uphill climb if you were wanting to walk up the village. Fairly small and quaint streets with nicely decorated gates, some of which are shops while others are residential, although most of the souvenir and food shops are at the lower end of the village. There are signs around asking you to not talk too loudly. There was one house which looked like a museum. You could go in to see what one of these houses look like inside and it was free entry. Most of these houses have electronic gates and garage openers. The houses slowly become more modern as you walk away from the village."
138,5.0,"People who wants to take photos are not allowed to make noise. It's great for photos and to walk around because its quiet. though there are too many people/tourist there, some are wearing traditional clothes that you can rent. Great experience for me as I'm into vintage stuff."
139,4.0,The street is narrow and you can see beautiful Hanok House side by side. There are some coffee places too. Do keep your voice low and do not disturb the quiet and peaceful environment there. I believed it is a good experience to stay in Hanok house.
140,4.0,"Nice place, easy walk from the palaces, full of good cafes and restaurants. We had a very good time here"
141,5.0,"A nice little cosy place for introduction to Hanoks, Korean traditional houses, in Seoul. One will find several signs of ""Silence Please"" as people still live here. Our guide told us that there are mostly used as vacation homes. It might seem intrusion into their privacy with loads of tourists invading the narrow street. Only a very few houses are open for visitors. We couldn't cover the entire stretch as we were tired coming here after visiting Gyeondbokgung palace, but I would believe its worth a stroll."
142,5.0,This is the best Hanok village in Seoul where one can get to see the architect and the beauty of the buildings. Walking around and taking photos here is good.One can also rent the Hanbok and experience being a Korean back to the olden days walking around the village in it! 🤩
143,3.0,"It was a hike which we didn't mind. We followed a walking tour but yet we still didn't learn much. Houses were well, houses. Don't get me wrong. I totally adore beautiful architecture. The houses were nice but they are all rebuilt with new materials so it looks astonishing new. Comparing with Kyoto and the alleys of Shanghai, this place pales in comparison and it's extremely touristy with tourist traps all along the way. It's a nice walk but if you don't have time, give this a miss."
144,3.0,"The Bukchon Hanok Village can be accessed via Anguk Subway Station Exit 2. This village is famous for its Bukchon's Eight Views for photography. We dropped here to have a look of the traditional houses in this village before heading to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The design of the traditional houses was beautiful. Since this village still occupied by the locals, hence the visitors must be ensure quietness is to be observed. We were here early in the morning, hence we could take various pictures without others appearing in our pictures. There is a shop for Hanbok rental located near the entrance of this village."
145,4.0,"I thought I was going to see a lot from this area but was wrong. It’s basically a small residential area with traditional homes from many years ago. You can appreciate the design/structure of the homes made of wood. There were a lot of tourists walking around, there were signs all over the place to be quiet since it is a residential area to this date. The streets are really narrow and long. I rented out the hanbok dress at the store closest to the entrance of this village. It was pricier than others, but this was my last chance to dress up :).When we walked down out side the village, we came across the chicken ginseng soup resto, it was delicious!"
146,3.0,"If you are curious how the residential area of the Koreans look like, you can drop by here. Maybe take a few photos, maybe an hour will do. This has become a tourist spot so you see signs of the residents to ""keep quiet"" to respect their privacy. Small village, nothing much to see and do."
147,5.0,Good experience to see the 'older' side of the residential area. Most of the houses are well kept and clean. Many tourists rented the hanbok to take pictures.
148,2.0,A few houses along a steep slope with some shops selling souvenirs and ice-creams nearby. not worth the visit. Waste time
149,4.0,Place was easy to find with Naver Maps app. It’s basically an uphill walk and a quiet residential area. Good for exercise those legs with steep hills. Many areas for Instagram worthy photos.
150,5.0,I feel sorry for the people that live in this neighborhood. There are signs that ask visitors to be respectful and speak quietly. But the chance to see Korean architecture is not to be missed. They have beautiful homes and views with some shops that will allow you to go inside and see what the home is like on the inside.
151,5.0,The Bukchon Hanok village is up on a hilltop not far from the hustle and bustle of the center of Myeongdong and the Palace. It 's a fairly steep climb up through the narrow  but picturesque little streets. Inside some of the homes are workshops selling or teaching Korean craftsmanship.  There is a nice view of the rooftops from the top of the village. The doors on some of the homes are quite ornate and fun to look at. Walk down the hill and stroll through the nearby shops and cafes. Nice place to spend about 3 hours.
152,5.0,Must experience. Rent their traditional costumes then tour the village! Great for unlimited pics and memories.
153,4.0,Went to the Bukchon Hanok Village and it was a trip worth making. The traditional house is really nice.
154,4.0,"It's a nice place to visit, you can even rent their traditional Hanbok costume for taking pictures around the Hanok Village, costume rental costs 10,000won per hour, hairdo + 5,000won"
155,4.0,"Take a walk through this ‘village’ to get a taste of what Korea was like before Seoul became a megalopolis. More like several, wide city blocks Bukchon village is a nice mix of narrow streets, tea and coffee houses, museums, craft workshops and little shops interspersed with private homes from modest to quite grand. Stop at the visitor center for a map with a nice walking trail laid out and then be prepared to wander for the next hour or so as you explore. Tip: stop at the tea museum (top of the trail) for a great view of the village and surrounding area. It costs 5,000 won to get in but includes a nice cup of tea with your view."
156,3.0,I may qualify this area as traditional...if you are a big fun of culture palaces then you should definitely visited. They are many hanok the traditional korean houses....you can take pictures inside the house also there's a palace nearby...you can also rent the Hanbok before going there from Hanbok shops nearby ... it's a very quite neighberhood where you can find nice restaurant we have tried an italian one which is very good....also don't miss a shop of traditional croissant...they're so much delicious they taste like a little drops of heaven
157,5.0,"This is a small village of traditional korean houses (Han-ok). This area was the place where government officers lived during Chosun dynasity, because of its location close to the Kyungbok palace. With an one hour, self-guided walking tour around the village, you can enjoy a scenery of korean traditional houses on narrow alleys. There are several shops where you can rent korean traditional outfits for your memorable picture. There are many attractive cafe, restaurants in Sam Cheong dong, a village near Bukchon. In addition, this place is close to other tourist attractions such as Insa dong and Kyoungbok palace. You can visit here after of before visiting these nearby places."
158,5.0,"If you imagine, pre war Seoul was filled with these traditional Korean houses you will find in this area. All lost for a more concrete solution, but here. On weekends people rent the traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) and roam the streets which adds to attractiveness of this area, nearly nestled between the two major palaces of Seoul. There are many nice cafes and tea houses where you can relax from the busy streets and enjoy the inside of a Hanok.Do not forget to bring your camera and enjoy this glimpse into the past."
159,5.0,"Bukchon is a gorgeous neighborhood full of beautifully restored historic hanok buildings interspersed with hipster cafes, small artsy boutiques, and traditional Korean restaurants. There are two parts to the area. West Bukchon is bordered on the west by Gwanghwamun Palace and contains arts-related attractions like the National Museum of Contemporary Art, the Hyundai Gallery, and many others. West Bukchon is full of established boutiques, restaurants, and cafes. Many people take photos along the high palace walls and in front of White Birch Story Cafe because the popular K-Drama ""Goblin"" was filmed here. This is also where you'll find Artee Riders pedicab tour company - book a tour and enjoy a glass of vin chaud in their cafe, but leave room for a hottoek (Korean deep-fried doughnut filled with cinnamon, sugar and seeds) at the stand across the alley. West Bukchon also has the huge, flagship Wood and Brick bakery and restaurant, which is definitely worth a visit for excellent salads, sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. East Bukchon is just across the busy road called Bukchon-ro and is bordered on the east by Changdeokgung Palace. This area has the most picturesque streets and lavishly restored hanok houses - you could spend hours wandering the hilly alleyways taking photos everywhere. There is also a main shopping street in this area, that has more hipster, independent establishments like industrial-chic cafes and a bespoke tailor/whiskey bar called Knockers where they play Frank Sinatra and is run by the most stylish father-son duo you'll ever meet.If you only have one day in Seoul I highly recommend spending it exploring Insadong, Bukchon, either or both of the major Palaces, Gwangwhamun Square, and maybe pop into Jogyesa Buddhist Temple. They are all so conveniently located and everything is easily walkable."
160,4.0,"Don't fool yourself into thinking that this place is very close to the palace. It is quite a bit of a walk. Recommend taking a taxi. Taxis are much cheaper in Seoul as compared to a lot of other countries in the East or West. The village is on both sides of the road and there are a few points from where you get good photos. Steep climb and not stroller friendly, No baby changing stations.The place is pretty though. We had our GInseng chicken soup in one of the nearby restaurants which was fab."
161,5.0,"I recommend you to rent hanbok (traditional korean costume) & take tons of photos! Love getting lost & going through back alleys. You will find lots of quaint cafes, boutique shops & the amazing Korean building architecture which takes you back in time!"
162,3.0,It is nice to walk around and take photos in front of the traditional houses but not much to do here. There are a few shops but not very many and when I have taken guests jere both trips have been short. This would be a good site to take a guided tour if that is offerred to get a better understanding of what you are looking at.
163,4.0,It's a residential area. Nothing much to see but old houses. Nice cheap stores in the area. Close to some palaces. Clean streets.
164,5.0,"It's amazingly beautiful place! So aunthetic and quite. Also, many interesting traditional coffee shops and museums here."
165,4.0,"If a semi heritage self tour is what you want to do, this is one of them. Old houses and new houses with the era architecture. (Although there are new styles). It is a walking tour so be prepared.  It should be mentioned that this place sits on a hill, so there is a good deal of climbing. We were there during the winter and I would imagine the place during the summer where it would be hard finding a shade. There are places selling snacks in the base of the hill, but again, it is a walk."
166,5.0,Did a small walkabout the area as it wasn't too far off GYBHK palace. Nice quaint place for pics and even rent traditional wear and snacks.
167,4.0,A lovely village with many old traditional Korean houses.  Saw many tourists wearing hanbok and took pictures.  it is a bit of uphill and downhill climb but worth it since the view is good!
168,5.0,It have many historical buildings and the structure are unique. It was well preserved and very clean. Many tourists came here to visit.
169,5.0,Been to Seoul many trips but this time tool the effort to visit. It will be a sure stop next trips. Such a lovely place to spend the afternoon. The houses were magnificent and gorgeous. Found an ahjumma selling hotteok and it's simply divine. So so good. Only wish I could eat more than one...
170,5.0,"We liked the whole relaxing atmosphere of Bukchon. The houses were beautiful and we also chanced upon a  'shop' selling candles and perfumes/oils. Some of the scents were really unusual so we could not resist buying some. Overall, it was a relaxing afternoon for us and although we would have liked to wear a hanbok like some of the other tourists, it was too cold for us."
171,3.0,"We followed the signage to the observatory. It's on the top floor of a building in the area. Paid 3,000won/adult for the entrance fees. Quite a stunning view but it's not something that you will view for hours. We sat in the observatory area for half hour to rest our legs after all the walking,  took pics and left."
172,5.0,Go on weekend. It's very croud but very authentic! A lot o locals go there and there are places to rent traditional costumes for you to take pictures. I have amazing pictures of locals with there costumes. Some nice places to eat to.
173,4.0,"The village is located nearer to one of Seoul's major palaces, Changdeokgung.  You can get off at the Anguk, and start looking for groups of giggling hanbok-wearing girls (locals + tourists) making their way somewhere.  Chances are they're heading to this village for their cutesy photos.  This is a residential area where traditional houses are preserved for modern day use.  You'll find average looking houses interspersed with grand structures with formidable gates.  However, do remember that there are real people living inside these houses, so a little consideration for their peace will be much appreciate.  Silence is golden."
174,5.0,"We were staying in a hanok (Irang Guesthouse - highly recommended) in Bukchon Hanok Village. Hence we could explore the area and the famous 8 sights early in the morning, before tour buses arrive.The other advantage of staying in the village was that we can start from the top (near 3rd view), and walk down.  (So many friends who started from Anguk Station complained that there were many slopes to climb.)It was a lovely morning walk, and we found it interesting to meander around hanoks which are lived-in (and not museum pieces).  There was some construction near 6th view, which was a pity as this was one of my favourite views.Enjoy..."
175,3.0,Walked around this traditional village for about 2 hours. Checked out traditional houses which partly have been converted to restaurants and shops.
176,3.0,"It's too commercialised, shops everywhere. Shops are more attractive than culture. I'm not very impressed."
177,4.0,"From Gyeongbokgung Palace we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village. We got lost and good thing we found information center where they give you a map but they don't speak a lick of english. There are 2 areas of the village and we chose the left side entrance of the road. We rented hanbok for only 1 hour. Rental for an hour is 10,000 won while 5,000 won for the hair arrangement, 1,000 won for the peticot and another 1,000 won for the locker where you keep your belongings while you roam around the village. Many tourists flock the area in the afternoon so better be early if you want to have a moment on your own with no photobombers. The village is very quiet and the houses are picturesque. If only one owner of the house would allow tourists to enter his house then that would be great. We can see the actual beauty of the house inside out. It's also possible to see the inside beauty because there are houses that turned into a guesthouse but very pricey compared to other hotels. All in all its good."
178,4.0,"this place is private quarters for many locals so behave, be quiet and respectful. similar to walking through a french village, you could take photos of the unique architecture. bring good cameras. one of the road has namsan tower in the background"
179,5.0,"Enjoyed maze like street full of Korean traditional old houses. Amazingly people still lives in those houses. Watching roof tops at higher place was spectacular. If you are not sure about navigating street, join the short tour. But lost in the maze would be a fun too (if you have time)"
180,5.0,It was truly an amazing experience!The rental of the costumes were seamless and the lady was really helpful. The were information staff stationed at different parts of the village and they speak English and were extremely helpful.It was a beautiful village and worth the visit for anyone visiting Seoul the first time.
181,4.0,"This neighbourhood is where the traditional Korean houses (hanok) are located. Some houses are centuries years old and while most of these houses are still occupied by actual living people, some have turned them into shops selling teas, souvenirs, food, perfumes, etc. Good place to have leisurely strolls or people-watching while taking a sip of tea or a bite of pastry."
182,4.0,We cheated and took a taxi to the highest point in the village and then walked down ! It is a lovely little village with houses still faithful to the original buildings. We spent a few hours looking around and checking out the little museums and coffee shops.
183,3.0,This place is literally a neighborhood for residents. They just kept their houses looking like the old houses. It is advised to keep quite here. There is a bit of walk for you here but literally almost everything looks the same.I recommend you spend 30mins to 1 hour in this place.
184,4.0,"Couldn't find the place last year and would have failed too this year although we have the ""Korean version of its location"" to the taxi driver. Luckily came across the Seoul Hanok center where the nice lady there gave us a detailed map of the area including a suggested walking route to see all there was to see. The major areas were a bit busy with everyone wanting to take photos and selfies but the majority of the path was quiet and very peaceful to explore.Came across the ""observatory"" which is actually someone's rooftop home where he charges for access to take photos. This can be skipped though. Also found a nice Korean tea house along the way that serves excellent tea in a tranquil and beautiful Korean traditional house setting."
185,4.0,"After the visit of the palace we went to the village walking around the shops and houses. It offer variety of cosmetics, hand made shops which offer classes, coffee shops with nice atmosphere. Worth going for sure."
186,4.0,"The view was great and very ancient. Feels like Kyoto. If you have issues with legs, suggest to get a cab up there. The stairs will drain your energy."
187,3.0,"This is an area where ordinary people live. Many houses are in traditional Korean form, but not sure whether they are newly built or historical. They are all similar so after a while you feel so so."
188,5.0,"As a girl who lives in Seoul, here is one of my favorite places in the city. When my foreign friends come to visit, I never skip to bring them here. 1. Bukchon Hanok Village is traditional residence areas in a peaceful and calm atmosphere. 2. This area is connected to Samchung-dong main street where you can visit pretty cafes, cosmetics shops, art galleries, and fine restaurants! 3. There are plenty of shops to rent Korean traditional clothes called Hanbok in this area. With wearing Hanbok and walking around the village, you can enjoy the old town  100%."
189,4.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village, I was told, is the only Hanok area in Seoul that actually has people living in them as homes today, whereas other Hanok villages are made for tourism show purposes and are not lived in.   We didn't get to see inside of an Hanok but just to walk around the area was pleasant enough. There were several quaint cafes and boutiques that made the place feel like a cool hangout area.  The area is pretty large. Be prepared to walk a lot to cover them all,"
190,4.0,It is an interesting experience walking on the streets of this village surrounded by traditional korean houses. There are even visitors dressed in hanbok. I feel like being transported to joseon dynasty.
191,5.0,"Today (5/10/17) our next stop is Bukchon Hanok Village. We came here by subway from our Hotel (Nine Tree Premier) stop at Anguk Station. Take Exit 3 at Anguk Station and just go straight, the village located around 600m from Exit 3. There are few shop provide rental for Hanbok on your right sight heading to Bukchon. You can rent your Hanbok before proceed to village.Few restaurant also available at this area. We have our lunch Korean Restaurant just outside Exit 3.From this Bukchon Hanok Village you can walk to Geongbukyong Palace or just go back to Anguk station & take subway to Geongbukyong Station which is on the next stop.However we did not go to the palace, instead we took subway to Yeouinaru station for Hangang ARA Cruise."
192,3.0,"Nice glimpse of a traditional korean village.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of ongoing construction/restoration during our visit.  You can enter some houses and have a feel of korean tradition.  Be on the lookout for quaint coffe shops, art studios and activities in the houses that are open.Tip: you can rent a Hanbok/traditional Korean dress and roam around in traditional attire for a ""full"" experience :)"
193,5.0,"Our favorite neighborhood in Seoul. Old meets new in this friendly and inviting neighborhood. Easy to get to by metro. Spend the morning exploring, then go find a great spot for lunch!"
194,5.0,"A very iconic old neighborhood in seoul. Lovely small alleys and hanok houses. Lots of young people wearing Korean costumes, and it makes the place more picturesque"
195,5.0,"It is worth spending a few hours here meandering the small streets, and you get great views of Seoul in some spots.  There are a few houses that are open to visitors, and there are interesting small shops running through the main commercial street."
196,2.0,It is not strictly a village. more like few Streets off a main road. Probably will need to ask someone to locate it.We visited this on a rainy  day. Got down at anguk station took exit 2. The village is supposed to be on the left about 500 meters away. However we could not find it so ask for a Korean couple who pointed across the road. We still could not see it and we were lost. A middle aged Korean lady was walking towards the opposite direction from us heard our conversation with the couple. She accompanied us and showed us the nicest part of the village. For this she had to walk in opposite direction  for more than 1 km as well as had to get wet in the drizzle.I suggest if you are going there get a map of the village from one of the information centers around there.
197,4.0,"bukchon hanok village is the place to take photos and soak in the cultural atmosphere of South Korea. its unlike the hustle and bustle of the city or myeongdong but very quaint and peaceful. be careful not to disturb the residents who are still living there, but do say hi to them if you meet them. an absolute visit for cultural and architectural buffs :)"
198,4.0,A nice place to visit & do try the pumpkin toffee if you can from the old man selling it from a bicycle. The toffee is really delicious. You can only get it here!
199,4.0,We stayed in a Hanok for 2 nights in the Bukchon village. When you visit Seoul I would really advice to stroll around in the Bukchon village. It's great to leave all the high buildings and the busy live behind and walk between the traditional houses and visit some  shops. And when you stay some nights I would also recommend to sleep in a Hanok and experience the traditional live over there including the great Korean breakfast (like we had in the excellent Cheong Yeon Jae Hanok Hotel).
200,5.0,We walked here with our son who lives in Seoul. We enjoyed a very quiet and peaceful view of traditional Seoul culture. The streets are steep so be careful if you have problems walking.
201,3.0,"I had chance to stay the night at Bukchon Hanok village and was a bit worried about how to find the place. However, I used the Airvan Service which brings me to the destination from ICN and that just shorten my travel time. The neighborhood is really cute and beautiful with traditional architectures, Hanoks. As it is known for it's traditional houses, there were so many people walking around even in Hanbok. I loved how the traditional and modern buildings coexist together in this busy city. The Hanoks made me calm and everything looked so peaceful."
202,5.0,"There is no bad time to come here. Day, evening, fall, spring, it has little treats around every corner and everyone seems to enjoy being there or discovering it."
203,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village take you back in time to olden Korean houses and structure.  Very picturesque and quaint to walk along the area to see the houses, street lamps and roofs.  What is incredible is that people actually live here.  Make an effort to visit as you will not be disappointed."
204,5.0,"It's quite a hike to get to Bukchon Hanok Village but the view is worth it! Look out for the guides in red shirts to guide you to the village.The traditional houses are stunning and the neighbourhood is peaceful. If you have some time, pop by into some of the stores there.Good to grab a banana milk and some snacks while on the way:)"
205,2.0,"Just ordinary view. I suggest you to find a restaurant with a fixed price that show in front of it, or you should pay the expensive price like we did."
206,5.0,"We walked throughout the village. There are many shops selling different items, from clothes, shoes, art items, etc... loads of restaurants and cafes too. Different from city shopping."
207,3.0,"Here one can see the traditional and modern korean structures side by side, Narrow allies, well maintained traditional building structures.it's an amazing view."
208,4.0,"We originally planned to visit this village around 2pm after our gyeongbokgong palace visit and ginseng chicken lunch.However, the scotching hot sun is really unbearable for us and we decided to visit here around 5pm. Houses are beautiful and built on inclined pavement. There are lots of signs to remind visitors to lower their volume. Quite a unique experience despite the hot sun."
209,4.0,"You can take the subway line 3 (orange) and get out from Anguk station at exit 2 or 6. Go north towards Buchon-ro. There at interesting quaint shops along the way, and some Sundubu restaurants the local visits. Walk about 100 M or so to the intersection and Bukchon village is a little  further up to the north. Turn right 100M to Changdeokgung Palace or turn left a 120 M to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You will find plenty of Hanbok rental stores and I recommend 3355 Hanbok rental for their cleanliness and service. Do be very quiet in consideration of residents still living in the ancient houses. The structures, doors, roofs, walls are very interesting and make good photo back drops. It is not necessary to go where all the bus loads of tourists are led to. There are some more further up and opposite the road."
210,5.0,Nice to see but still missing to renovate some of the houses there and it will be perfect. Nice places to see and drink and eat. Very charming anyway. Nice pictures to do but recommend it on the night mainly. Thanks
211,4.0,"Strolling through the neighborhood on a Sunday, when lots of Koreans are in traditional dress, is fun. But having informaiton about what to see, provided by the Visitor Center, would make the visit even better. So don't plan to go on Sunday!"
212,1.0,We use Google maps to find this place.We walk along the road of some of Hanok village but some of it has been modernise.Definitely will go again to find the right place.
213,5.0,"A place where you can find Korean traditional houses. Felt I was transported to a different time. Considering how ultramodern Seoul can be,really nice to find a place like this! A must visit for tourist. An Iconic village! Wearing our rented hanboks, me and my daughter enjoyed roaming around this beautiful village. We felt like a local!"
214,5.0,"We are from California and are in a hanok right now!  It's so beautiful inside. If you get a chance to rent one,  do it! We have had lots of people knock on our door, asking to look inside.  I don't mind though."
215,3.0,"tough way to walk uphill in the hot summer weather.most of the houses are closed, cannot view the interior.only can take photos from outside. after a while, all of them look the same."
216,5.0,"To find this easily, go to the number 8 must visit spots in Bukchon which is available in all maps. The place is hilly but worth it. There are many tourist here but you can still capture the hanoks. If you are into kdrama (personal taste) this is not where the filming was shot. It is on the other street."
217,3.0,"This community is on the slope of a foothill. We followed the google map and got off the bus at wrong stop and walk back to the village. The sign was hard to understand the best way to visit the village. Confused us a lot! The authority should improve the sign to make it easier to understand and please...in English! Almost everything here cost you money, take a look at the signs carefully..."
218,4.0,Beautiful traditional houses and quaint little streets with nice views. Shops and restaurants too. Had great Korean BBQ lunch!!
219,4.0,"Most of the houses in this village had been renovated but they maintain the outside facade, so it is very interesting to walk around the narrow alleys in this village. Each house has different main gate design."
220,5.0,"Love the little allies here surrounded by Hanok - traditional Korean houses, one can find a few DIY jewellery shops as well as little cafes and Korean eateries. Try to be there around noon time as most shops open after 11. If your schedule allows, book for a Hanok Stay, well worth it!"
221,4.0,Went here after a visit to Namsan tower. A lot of hype from people about taking selfies in a hanbok. The site offers a glimpse of the past with a lot of alleways to get lost in. Enjoyed the walk then found some pretty good shops with a some good deals. There are a few boutique places to visit but the coffee shop with its cold brew equipment was great. Try their homemade cookies for snack whike walking around. Then going further down a few good souvenir shops. When tired there are a lot of taxis to hail and taxus in korea is cheap although they can be a bit of a maniac.
222,5.0,We walked through here with a tour guide so it wasn't so confusing which might have made the trip nicer than it could've have been if we were on our own but we had a great time in the Hanok Village. The homes were beautiful and we got many beautiful photos. We even made a stop where we went inside one of the homes that was on exhibit to show tourists the size of the inside of the houses l (which are tiny by the way-I don't know how people live like that). It was a very lovely walk through and lasted about an hour. However it was a bit of a walk to get to the village so if you are not up to a 20 minute walk or so with an incline I would not recommend the Village to you.
223,5.0,"This place is near by Palace (around 20' walking). The area is totally different from the Myongdong. You can discover the houses in traditional styles stand beside the ones in modern but the general is so harmonies. At the end of the Main Street, you can see an university which is built with the style of Europe."
224,4.0,"Bukchon hanok village very near to Gyeongbokgung palace.From main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace we just follow the street and then turn left after that just go straight untill you find the street name at right side.( you need to cross the street).Btw,its better you if you get a map from tourist information office.so many people wearing hanbok around this place.Great experience.In small street got many mini shops which sell cloth and light food."
225,4.0,"Road abit steep at some point, would required to walk up slope.Do wear comfortable shoes.Beautiful place for photo taking."
226,4.0,"My family took subway (Dark Blue line1) from Seoul station for 3 stops to Jongno 3(sam)-ga and transfer to Orange line 3 for 1 stop to Anguk station. Exit 3 and walk towards Constitution Court of Korea, and carry on walking for another 5 mins up slope and you should be able to see the entrance to the conservatory Bukchon Village. For those who has plans to try out their traditional hanbok costumes, one can try renting them in Anguk station or shops around the station. One advise is to go early so one would have the widest choices of prettiest and best hanbok available to choose from. Cost wise is normally 10,000won for 2 hrs, 20,000 for 4hrs."
227,5.0,"We didn't find it at first, but when we did the picturesque village was worth a look. Be awarw that there are quite a lot of tourists (like yourself) that are in the way of that perfect picture."
228,4.0,"Road very steep at some point, gorgeous architecture. Lots of tourist, beautiful scenery at the higher point. A must visit when in Korea."
229,4.0,"Picturesque, charming, hilly, rustic, stone and earth dwellings. A look backward to the traditional homes of the elite. Also, museums, galleries, cafes, traditional Hanok houses. If you make it to the top, I have been told, the view is spectacular. My bum knee kept me from making it that far. Sigh."
230,4.0,"We had a fairly difficult time finding the actual village proper, because after getting off at the right subway, you need to walk a long, long way to see any tourists. We definitely had different expectations upon arriving. What we assumed was a museum-like town turned out to be an actual residential district! People actually live in this part of town, and what makes it a ""hanok"" village is that all of their homes resemble the old ""hanok"" of Korea's past dynasties. Unless you get a walking tour with a group, you won't have any commentary at all. But if you go here yourself, you can find a hanbok rental store and wear their traditional costume around the village for 1-2 hours! I think it's a great deal and is worth the Won because the experience of wearing their costume freely around an old-school style village is priceless. It's like you're living the life of a traditional Korean princess! Besides that, there isn't much to see or do."
231,4.0,"Near by historical museums can be found, lots of shopping, food and you can see also tourist wearing Hanbok; old architecture of their houses can be seen here."
232,3.0,"if you don't have the time , then this place is worth a short visit of about 2 hours . The place is big and you might not see the real Bukchon Hanok village.  here is a tip -Get a map from the tourist office at Insadong . They are really helpful  and will point out which streets to go to.  only a few streets are worth seeing. The rest are just too modern. but if you really have time and want to see a real Hanok village then take a day trip to Yongin , ( south of Seoul) or go to Andong Folk village.  They are really two Hanok of differing eras. Yongin is reflective of earlier Joseon whilst Andong Folk village is more a later Joseon. Whilst Bukchon is more like a 20th century version of a Hanok village.  Korean drams use Yongin and Andong as film locations for Saguek dramas.Here is a tip, go to the visitkorea website and join a free walking tour with a guide you will learn so much more of the Bukchon area. Lin Lin"
233,4.0,We visited this village in the morning. It is nestled behind commercial shops and restaurants so we had a hard time looking for it. We saw ancient and traditional houses which were given to the nobility during the past. Hanbok rental are available for authentic feel during those times. I got to wear one. Amazing!
234,4.0,"Visit if you like architecture and also buying/looking at handicraft items. A lot of the traditional houses (with proper signage) are actually open for visits (free) and you can pick up a map from these locations that have a route planned out for you. At the end of the route, you will end up along Yulgok-ro 3 gil which is a very trendy and lively street with shops and nice modern/traditional blended houses. This street is connected to Insadong"
235,5.0,"Really amazed of the beautiful Old Korean House and the beautiful cherry blossoms that surrounds the village. It`s very near Myeongdong, and just get off at Chungmuro Station exit 3 then just 2 minutes walking and you will see this beautiful Korean Village. There`s a lot of activities you can try to. I was amazed of the cherry blossoms there."
236,5.0,this is a must visit place while you are in Seoul.. stacks of korean style home and few shops along the way.. has a view of the neighborhood... rent an hanbok and take a picture of yourself in one of the studios. there were many boutiques where you can pretty stuffs ..
237,5.0,"Good thing that we booked for the free local guided walk otherwise we might not appreciate as much the history and culture of this place other than seeing the type of traditional Korean house.  Started at Unhyeongung understanding the history of this palace, the differences in the gender affecting the housing and decor before walking to see the high school where Winter Sonata was filmed.  Followed by the hanok village itself where the guide also brought us to see the Kokdu museum and sharing with us which houses were used by which k drama with which popular Korean actors/actresses.  Recommend to go for this guided tour rather than walking by yourself plus it is Free!!"
238,4.0,"관광객이 너무 많아 천천히 돌아보지 못 한 것이 너무 아깝습니다만, 너무 큰 기대를 하지 않고 아기자기하게 펼쳐진 골목길을 둘러 보고 현대식 건물들 사이에 남아 있는 옛 모습들을 즐긴다면 더 좋았을 것 같습니다. 단, 음식점들이 너무 고가인 관계로 잘 조사한 후에 적절한 식당을 미리 알아 가는 것이 좋겠습니다.It was a big island surrounded by modern buildings. It is good to walk slowly through back alleys. I would like to recommend to wear Han-Bok (Korean traditional costume. there are many rental shops) and take some pictures in front of traditional houses."
239,4.0,This is a private area wherein you can see old Korean houses.  A bit steep for walking and lots of tourist.  Good to go to see the traditional houses in Seoul.
240,4.0,"nice place to take photos, especially if you already renting the hanbok and wearing them before going to this place. the perfect itinerary was going to rent hanbok around the palace, going to palace and strolling around and after that you can go to this village with that hanbok (because usually the renting time was just 2hrs or 4hrs)."
241,4.0,"This is actually not a tourist area but private residences! People stay in these homes. Try to stay quiet and respectful while exploring the area. The village has many old Korean houses. Little shops and eateries line along the streets of the exits, and you can rent a hanbok to walk in all day at a rental shop nearby."
242,3.0,"There really was nothing much to do here but take pictures and some stroll around it, so overall it was simply okay."
243,5.0,I walked on old street. There are many old korean style houses around the area. Tourists are wearing traditional clothes and enjoying like TV drama stars who act as girls in old palace. There are many rental costume shop. I wanna try someday.
244,5.0,"If you're a fan of treadmills and you've been doing the climb and these streets are all yours. The scenery is beautiful and the cultural heritage is surely there. This is not a museum nor a public place, these are people homes and they live inside there. There's a lot of warning not to be noisy and appreciate the neighborhood but seems like the local teens are the one that so noisy, all the tourists from abroad. At least when we were there, are all paying respect and keep their voices down. Many girls wearing gorgeous hanbok took pictures here and there's a delicious delicacies like octopus, taebokki. And i love the perfumery there too. A must visit for sure.  on the top of the road there's like a temple, but walking there is a bit tough,  do use walking shoes."
245,4.0,Came here after reading reviews. Managed to find after following the instructions on the street map. Walked around for nearly an hour
246,5.0,"Lived here for 6 months! WOW! Quintessential traditional Korean! Beautiful traditional buildings and you can rent out Hanbok costumes (traditional Korean attire) to complete the feeling. A part of all tourist stops when visiting Seoul, and just to the right of the Royal Palace and the Blue House. Some superb gastronomic cubby holes .... eating is Seoul is overall cheap and an unforgettable experience - after a total of 18 months ... a complete convert!"
247,5.0,"Walking through the streets is so nice, seeing the old style hanok homes, also before going into the hanok streets there's a lot of cool shop for souvenirs or for food too."
248,4.0,"pros:- charming neighbour with traditional korean house (please low down your voice theres residence within the house)- you should come here early morning to get a good picture. during day there are so many tourist walking around.- good place for photography and sight seeing- its free to walk aroundcons:- very small areas. you can finish less than 1 hour- not many store, cafe and restaurant within the areas. mostly just residence house- you need to walk around hilly areas.- not a good place to visit during rainy day- i dont see any public toilet around the areas"
249,4.0,Nice little cultural village with traditional houses.  Have good walking shoes if you're going there. There are a few good souvenirs stores as well as nice small restaurants and snack stalls. We were there on a beautiful sunny Saturday so it was quite packed.
250,4.0,Very traditional & unique..its gd tat such a heritage still exist. Explore around with my family till the top..Amazing scenaries with those many mountains.took pics with those whos wearing traditional hanok costumes. Lots of tourists n definately will come again..
251,4.0,"We visited on a sunny afternoon in late-March, after going to Changdeokgung palace in the morning. It's a nice walk through narrow streets lined with old-style houses, some of which are coffee shops. There were lots of tourists but everyone respected the privacy of the local people and kept their voices quiet. The views from the top of the hill were great and we enjoyed wandering around for a few hours."
252,4.0,"The wonderful village at Seoul, many houses with the original style and traditional things.We can wearing hanok and walking around for taking the pictures here."
253,4.0,The area is very picturesque and unique with lots of character. There are interesting shops and museums to visit in the village but the sharp inclines and windy lanes can make it tiring for some.
254,4.0,"This place just like another dimension, the architecture and design was astonishing! i mean people still living there! who doesn't want to live in a beautiful place like that? the environment was really great! also this place was really close to gweongbokgung palace. By wearing the hanbok you can get a very great picture with this place! but yeah most this place you need to have stamina! climb uphill and downhill.."
255,5.0,We went there at night so it was very quiet and very few people. You can see the N-tower from one area. We really enjoyed the HanOk style homes! Nice place to visit and take photos.
256,4.0,Must place to visit. Just be aware that this is residential area and must observe silence everywhere.
257,3.0,"It was quite a cold winter day when we explored this area. It's all outdoors so it can be difficult in the cold. But there's some shops or eateries to pop into if you must. We walked around many of the old houses and also went into some which were open for viewing, such as the tourism heritage house. Got a good feel of how the people lived in olden days. Quite a nice experience. Most of the eateries were closed from 2:30 to 5pm, so we didn't manage to get a tea time snack and hide from the cold even though we wanted to. It's just a nice place to wonder about and admire architecture and some old crafts too. The slopes can be quite steep, so people with weak knees may find it tough. Also, many houses here are still inhabited, so tourists must keep quiet and respect their privacy and take care of the environment."
258,4.0,"Seeing the Bukchon village is a good thing to do on a nice afternoon. Be prepared to walk for about an hour through pedestrian-friendly streets, but keep in mind there are some hills. If you're visiting when it's really hot, you won't want to do it during the heat of the day. Because people live in these houses there are many signs asking for quiet and respect of private property. In the busier and more contemporary area, you'll find lots of restaurants, shops and treats. Another highlight is seeing all the tourists dressed in traditional Hanboks - great for photos.Enjoy the walk and the nice architecture."
259,4.0,"Quite uphill so be ready to walk, plenty of souvenier shops around and coffee shops for breaks and rest."
260,5.0,"We went to the Bukchon Hanok Village.  Be prepared to walk. The roads are very narrow and steep but it's worth the visit. However, it can get a bit crowded. It was very nice to walk along the houses. There were Street food along the way."
261,4.0,Nothing much to mention about the area but one thing is worth mentioning was the samgyetang chicken we had before exploring bukchon village. food was great at affordable price
262,3.0,"Nice traditional houses, interesting to look at. Some spots are great for photo taking.  To view the inside of a house, you can get into one that has ongoing activities to have quick look and a few pictures - leave shamelessly if you are not keen to pay for joining, which we did. :P  Does not need very long to finish the whole area, they look quite the same after 30mins."
263,5.0,The Bukchon Hanok Village is a testament to the old Korean culture and history as hanok or traditional Korean houses were preserved. We joined a free walking tour offered by the Seoul Tourism Organization wherein we learned more of the history of Bukchon Hanok Village through their volunteer tour guides. This is a valuable and enriching experience for tourists.
264,4.0,"A great place to walk around and discover different activities and shops. It's an actual area where people live so be mindful of the residents. Come before 5 to experience the handiworks and the hands-on activities. We came too late for it, but it is still a picturesque area to meander."
265,3.0,Bit of a letdown this traditional village. Place looks deserted except if you admire traditional korean architecture. Its a bit like a hilly walk behind back alleys. Nothing much to see.
266,5.0,Traditional house area to walk around. Surrounded by busy traffic and modern buildings yet the premise is quaint and picturesque. Modern meets traditional architecture is amazing too.This is residential area so quiet is a must in order not to disturb the people living here. Some slopes very steep and it’s all about walking up and down. Worth a visit!
267,4.0,Ancient village in the city. There are many nice shop near this village. Don't miss to visit here. This place is far from subway.
268,4.0,"The street is lined up with traditional Korean architecture. Good for photo taking. There is hanbok rental shop nearby $18000w per person for a couple of hours. Lots of tourists, can't take a photo without people in it."
269,4.0,"This area is really near the Gyeongbokgung Palace area and it should definitely be in your itinerary for visit as the houses really are traditional and worth visiting. There are plenty of cafes and small houses operating as restaurants serving traditional Korean dishes, cafes serving coffee and cakes, and there were also an area for shopping. I particularly liked a shop which sold traditional Korean clothes though it would be weird for me to be wearing them out of Korea so i decided not to buy them."
270,4.0,"The whole area is basically a residential area with an traditional kind of architecture. It's nice to spend some time and have a slow walk around these houses. There're some stores selling things too. Things that are sold here are usually a bit pricy than outside. However, we should lower our voice while walking around as its a residential area. It's worth going to take some pictures and to know more about Korea. :)"
271,5.0,"These are the traditional type houses and contrast to the more modern dwellings in other parts of the city. There are hills and steps so it is a physical activity. Local shops are also a high;light with some nice craft stores along with the usual cheaper socks, etc shops"
272,3.0,Fully immerse yourself with the preserved houses by dressing up with a hanbok. Just be sure to be quiet and to not knock on the houses as they are privately owned as well
273,4.0,"It is a village with traditional Korean homes, or known as HANOK. There are 8 photo spots to look for. However you can still take photos anywhere and everywhere. To go here take a subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) and go out from Exit No 2."
274,5.0,"If you're a fan of K-dramas, you will definitely feel like one of the characters here. It's one of those scene where they climb up the hill going home or something like that (Haha!) You'll be able to go into one of the houses and see what it looks like on the inside. You'll also see people wearing the traditional Hanbok."
275,5.0,Worth the time exploring this quaint and serene village. The houses were unique and the scenics were picturesque. Plenty of tourists as you would expect but there are enough spaces to take the perfect photo. A must-go if you are in Seoul!
276,3.0,"We spent about 2 hours exploring the Bukchon village. As there are residents staying inside, we have to keep our noise level to a minimum. There are quite a few streets that are more traditional than the rest. I just hope that the new building are not invading the old style buiding structure further, else this village is not going to retain its tradtional images."
277,4.0,"Love the old traditional houses and tiny alley ways. And with little quaint shops peppered all over with good cafes and eateries, it is indeed time well spent on a cold afternoon."
278,5.0,There are quite a few of traditional Hanok spread across the streets. All are very unique and quite well maintained.Quite a pleasant walk along these streets even in cold weather.
279,3.0,If you are going to this place just to take photos. I will advise you to find the actual locations of the spot that you planned to have your photos taken. I went to this place twice in my trip and I spent hours running up nad down to find the 'right' spot.Please be prepare to trek the uphills
280,5.0,"We stayed on one of these traditional houses that was converted into a hotel/homestay.  Really lovely experience to be in such a cosy home.   The owner was very helpful and upgraded us to a room that had an adjoining toilet.  My family of five slept comfortably in the two rooms even though they were kind of small.  The village or area itself is quiet and is a great place with quaint little shops selling souvenirs, clothes, Jewellery.  They aren't tacky shops but are shops that sell affordable local brands. Most of the shops are located along two main roads  but you won't find it as busy or crowded as Myeongdong which is another experience of its own.  So while most tourists spend an afternoon walking and looking and the old houses, this was actually a nice refuge and charming place to spend a a couple of days at.  We really enjoyed the cafes and interesting shops that we could take our time with and not be hassled by crowds.  From here we could venture to Insadong which was nearby."
281,3.0,"We strolled Bukchon and saw many houses with characters. Some are shops and some are residences. We went inside a few shops partly for souvenir and partly to just look at those houses.Due to the high volume of tourists, there were often local people held up signs to ask tourists to be quiet."
282,4.0,"Really worthwhile to visit and to combine with other visits to local palaces and the Insadong shopping area. You can start with this village and continue to the palaces on walking distance, then end at Insadong."
283,3.0,"Bukchon is just a residential area with a taste of old Korea and most of the houses were locked and closed when we visited there. Need to walk for 20-30 mins along the wall of Gyeongbukgung palace before reaching Buckhon. Do take bus or other transport to reach Bukchon. Honestly, nothing much in Buckhon and should be able to complete the area by 1 hour."
284,3.0,"I would probably put this area near the middle or bottom of your list for places in Seoul.  Yes, there are some nice old houses in a residential area lined with very narrow streets.  The houses are on a hill so there are some nice views available, but it may require that you have a prerequisite good health to walk the hills.  And because it is a residential area, there are numerous signs and people (dressed in traditional Korean garb) standing with signs asking tourists to keep their voices down.There are also some restaurants and shops on the outskirts which provide some shopping opportunities.However, the area really doesn't warrant a must-see status..."
285,4.0,เป็นหมู่บ้านวัฒนธรรม ที่ยังคงรักษาสภาพอาคาร บ้านเรือน ในแบบดั้งเดิมไว้ได้อย่างดี สวยงาม มีจุดถ่ายภาพมากมาย เดินไกลนิด เหนื่อยหน่อย แต่ก็คุ้มThis is the cultural village that remain old style and beautiful. Although it's a long way for walking but valuable for photographer and most visitor.
286,3.0,Requires lots of walking up hills and downhills. Not suitable for elderly or children. The view is not bad. Visitors should wear proper shoes for this attraction. Sports shoes is highly recommended.

This is a beautiful place to Visit, You just have to be quiet because this is a residential area. Bukchon is 5-10 minutes walk to anguk station. Visit this place at Around 8-9AM because Group/bus of tourists usually arrives after this hour which makes it a little bit crowded."

It has a lot of walkings to do and the area is flooded with tourists in rented hanbok, so it makes you difficult to take some good photos as every corner you will bump into people."

We stayed in a traditional hanok in the Bukchon area on our first night and loved it so much we cancelled our accommodation closer to town and stayed on in an airbnb. Loved the area, great cafes, restaurants, galleries and shops. Easy to walk to streets, easy access to the palaces and also the subway for anywhere else. Would highly recommend."
