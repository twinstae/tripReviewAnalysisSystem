The oldish colonial building with magnificent steps (very British), the modern design wide concrete slope that leads to the steps in the background, and the flower beds. After the photoshoot, head for the shops in the area for what Seoul is known for; fashion and cosmetics. Easy access to the place as it has its Metro station and a bus stop where you can head for other places when you are done with the photography and the shopping."
1,4.0,The university is impressive. Physically and academically. But many people come here for the shopping. Less crowded then Myeondong but probably same price. The problem as in most Korean shops is that they do not display price and you have to ask for it and become suspicious that the price is not fixed.
2,3.0,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Ewha Fashion Street - a LOT of Korean makeup brands at the same price you'd find in a major US city ""Koreatown."" I found it especially baffling that 2 major brands would not sell single sheet masks, but wanted me to buy a minimum of 30! How am I supposed to commit to 30 (for about $65) when I don't know if I like it? I asked for the price for 10 or for 20 and they refused, even after I walked away (no counteroffer!).For fashion, we found much cuter clothes in the subway station itself - 5k won stylish t-shirts and 10k won pants and skirts; for accessories like bags, hats, and hair clips/pins, we preferred the shops in Myeongdong near Shinsaegae department store.Two standouts at Ewha:1) Olive Young--like a Korean version of Ulta--where there were some real bargains as well as bonus gifts and 10% off your 50k+ won purchase. Two branches on the same street (left and right)2) Art Box (one of the first shops closest to the subway) which had lots of cute Kakao character items, stationary, and knick knacks.Bummed that we didn't do better, but there's always a market or other district to try!"
3,4.0,"Great place to shop for cosmetics, fashions and knick knacks for good quality and under budget. For the men or those who would not want to shop, there are also many cafes and restaurants nearby."
4,5.0,"This is an excellent street for cosmetics, fashion and knick knacks. And good news for the men who donâ€™t dabble with cosmetics, you get to comb the many food stalls, cafe and restaurants for food, drinks and snacks. I prefer this kind of streets to shopping centers which can be seen everywhere.You can easily spend 2-4 hours here wandering through the street and peering at every shops and stalls."
5,5.0,Definitely a place for women who are into fashion. They provide a wide range of clothing for teenagers to young women and working adults. On good days you may get very good buy and quite a number of clothes are reasonably priced. They also have the higher end as well for those who do not mind paying.
6,5.0,"Very nice shopping area for youngster, there is eatery everywhere. Shopping starts when you are out fron the train platform."
7,3.0,"Ewha Womenâ€™s University is a famous place where people loves to take photos of the church building and the slope design building.There are many cheap eateries around the area and also sell most ladies clothes for obvious reason. ðŸ˜¬Take note!There is a â€˜famousâ€™ cosmetic shop. Please do not buy things from there! Though the items are cheaper than those already cheap in the stores, some of the items have expired or near expiry date! And you may not know if they are genuine as well!"
8,5.0,"I couldn't find what I liked in Insadong (1st day) and didn't know where else to look for young trendy fashion for my tween (mainly) and me (if there is anything suited me) in Seoul, I did a last minutes search and thanks to the TA, I came here for trying my luck, at the same to visit Ewha Women's University.From cosmetic to fashion to Korean unique creatives merchandise were all similar in all corners of Seoul, i believe. But I have to agree that this was peaceful shopping experience here than Myeongdong or Namdaemun. I enjoyed the leisure hunting here in the late afternoon and found some cheap buys."
9,5.0,"The great place for shopping. Not branded but the quality is just nice. Worth to buy. Also have the food street like in Myeondong. Handbag, clutch,clothes,shoes, everything is here. I've bought handbag with 10,000krw only."
10,3.0,"if you want to visit a college town, here is the place for you! its busy with college students and young Koreans. really trendy area of Seoul."
11,5.0,"A lot of shopping selling clothes, bags, mask and more! We went there to try most of the food stalls before shopping around. Worth for a visit and you will love it!"
12,4.0,Everything you see is all about women . If you are looking for causal shopping for young girls and ladies  this might be one of the options.
13,1.0,"After visiting Ewha front campus, it's within minutes of walk to reach these fashion street, it floods with shops selling owned or no brands of apparel. We did try 3 to 4 shops, and all of the shop people were very mean, long face and aggressive once you showed don't buy. It's a real bad name for Seoul, and visitors will ask if it was the national attitude of customer service for Korean. It just keep people away. Bad ! And hopefully it could be improved in the future."
14,4.0,"It is a very interesting place for young ladies as their prices are most reasonable and nice little shops with fashion, accessories  and interesting caps too. Love that place as it is special and much better than myeongdong as the merchandise there are more unique and not so crowded. Go on weekend for their flea market."
15,4.0,"I find it cheaper here and has lots of variety in fashion items as compared to Hongdae. There are jackets that cost 10k won but with very nice quality. That's aroung Php450.00. Also, I found items here from 5000-15,000 won which are very cheap and are really nice clothes. There's also a shop here who sells bags at 10k won no matter what the design is. Its synthetic leather but you'll really see how sturdy the material is. Inbought a couple of pants and shorts here and some tops for really cheap amount. If you are a budget traveller, there also street foods and cafes to try at a very affordable price since this is just mear a University. This is really worth the try! One of my favorites!"
16,4.0,"We had a walk around here and HongIk Street before heading to N Seol Tower. It was rainy day. We managed to visit museum inside the University and stopped at the bakery there. I am amazed with the University buildings and there was a church there too. Due to time limit, we just passed by the fashion street and tried some street food beside the shop lots. If you a korean cosmetic brand lovers, this street has lots of them."
17,5.0,Really nice place to visit and stay. The food especially the korean chicken is a must try. The things sold here are cheap as well. A must visit for shopaholics and budget travellers.
18,5.0,"This is probably the best place in Seoul to shop. Clothes, bags, shoes, trinkets, accessories, makeup etc etc. The alleyways and streets are filled with your usual shops you see elsewhere but there are also many unique and independent shops here and there. Things are very affordable and the designs differ quite abit from each other. There also always seems to be some sale going on at some of these shops. I bought a whole load of clothes and a really smart coat here at a very affordable price. I liked the ambience here â€“ it was pretty laid back and although quite crowded, it never really got to very annoying levels. If you are tired from shopping and want a haircut (lol) or a coffee, there are many hair salons and cafes dotted all over the place. This was one of my favourite areas in Seoul and I personally hope that this place never turns into another Dongdaemun or Myeongdong!"
19,5.0,Every time I go here I end up leaving with lots of shopping bags. Prices are ok and some even these days negotiable. Nice surroundings. You should also take in the university campus. It is not a place for guys though.
20,5.0,This street became very familiar due the fact that our daughter is studying at Ewha. Almost everything for young ladies. Personally I enjoyed to mingle with all the street food stands and they were not just a few.
21,4.0,"Clothes, bags, street foods! All are sold with cheap/ reasonable price and good quality. The street/s have much to offer. There's performances nearby (maybe from the college students) and anything that will pique the students' interests.. and of course,  at students' friendly price."
22,4.0,"Love it.Fashion stuffs are cheap and more variable compared to myeongdong (esp for the ladies).Coffeeshops are everywhere.Street foods are delicious.Small restaurants sold so many different stuffs,and so tasty.It's easy to find as well.Recommended."
23,4.0,"Went to this place with my sister in April of 2015. It is easily accessible via subway (Ewha Women's University station, exit 2 or 3).This is a good place to buy cosmetics and fashion items for women. This area near the school is relatively more quiet than Myeongdong and has a youthful vibe to it. My sister and I ate our favorite cheesy tteokbokki and fried chicken in a restaurant called Yang Pang. This place is worth a visit if you are into cheap, cute fashion finds and affordable snacks."
24,5.0,The bagggs there are amazing in design and really value for money! although there are other bags in shopping streets everywhere in korea but i like the way the streets are arranged whereby you can get to choose so many bags within a short vicinity so as not to panic buy any!
