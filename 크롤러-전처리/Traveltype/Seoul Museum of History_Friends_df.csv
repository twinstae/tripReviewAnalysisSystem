1,5.0,"Great place to learn about Korea over the years.  Nice historical exhibits and costumes.   It was interesting to see the 60s, 70s and 80s also represented.  Takes a couple of hours to walk around.  Definitely worth a visit."
2,5.0,The Seoul Museum of History isa great place to find out interesting details about Seoul’s history. Well worth a visit and it's free!
3,4.0,Here you will see how the city has evolved and know more about its history.  Well worth a visit and it's free!
4,5.0,We visited with a friend on a Sunday morning. The entrance is free. It's a great way to discover Seoul over the centuries and get a grasps of the hardship the people have suffered .
5,5.0,"A free entry, low key museum that tells you a lot about the city. Pretty much empty when we were there. Has a wonderful scale model of the modern city ... with an armoured glass cover so that you can walk over it. Fun!"
6,3.0,"Museum with informative display and description. Me and friend spent a few hours there, recommended."
7,5.0,We spent 5 hours going thru the exhibits.  The museum has 3 floors of extensive information.  The restaurant in the museum has a great selection of food plates which were affordable.
8,4.0,"In addition to a very interesting collection of artifacts, ancient and modern, regarding the city of Seoul, the grounds are also make for a pleasant stroll when the weather is good."
9,5.0,Incredible miniatures of old and early times of Korea . They also give you an understanding history. Not enough English so a guide is better
10,5.0,It's a very good museum that often has different events. You can also find some nice souvenirs to buy in the gift shop.
11,5.0,This is one of my favorite museums in Seoul and somewhere I always take visitors. They change the front exhibits regularly so it's interesting even for a frequent flyer like myself.The main reason to go is for the massive detailed recreation of Seoul. It's large and have most of the buildings in the city - I can find both where I work and my apartment building on there after some looking. It lights up to show different areas and is a great way to orient yourself to the city.
12,3.0,"It's close to Gwanghamun and free to enter.  They right now have a lego, danish exhibition and that's cool. A good place that you if interested should check out but it's not a must"
13,4.0,"I was first worried about the amount of children because as you first walk in the main entrance, there’s a Lego workshop and exhibition filled with students making projects.  Then in the Hans Christian Anderson section there were kids running around bumping into me but they were small children let loose by their parents. . There were many more children but they were well behaved by their teachers and many were sitting down writing down notes in groups. The museum won’t take you long to observe and if you are quick can be finished in about 30 minutes. If you read each exhibit especially the exhibit of the Korean cultural periods, it will take you about 2 hours. I especially liked the huge city landscape under the glass floor. There is a relatively inexpensive snack area and the restrooms have bidets (Japanese style restrooms, wow) The price of admission is free so if you’re near the downtown area, I’d advise you to come down and check this place out."
14,5.0,the history of SK is so strange and full of holes. I see that the system has the most effect on society
15,4.0,I guess the national museum called dibs on all the interesting artefacts. There is not much history in this history museum but the displays are well worth a visit. Seoul and South Korea have both undergone dramatic changes in the past century and this museum is terrific for an introduction in to the recent history of Korea. A giant interactive city model is one of many highlights. Definitely worth stopping by for an hour or two.
16,2.0,"Not really a museum, more of an interpretive centre on the history of Seoul. There are few artefacts, but rather displays. Seems to be used as daycare centre for kids. Ok for a short visit or if you have kids. Nice cafeteria."
17,5.0,"This is one of the less-visited large museums in the city.  The highlight for me is the wonderful, huge, topographical nightview model of Seoul that has glass-bottom footbridges over it.  While you walk across, the city lights come on in the areas you pass over.  There's also a museum employee on hand to help you identify different areas of the city.  Really impressive."
18,5.0,A well thought out museum and I learnt a lot from it. I think it is a good place to get a background of South Korea and I would recommend a visit.
19,4.0,"Korea has a great wealth of history.  This is a great way to learn more about  Korea!!  It is a good museum with lots of different exhibits!!  However, it is a history museum...so if that isn't your thing...skip it!"
20,4.0,This museum contain all the history about seoul from how the city becomes like today. War history. Japanese invasion. Or even how local lives in town. What I'm really surprised is there is a section about how seoul will grow in the future it's all the plans for the city to develop more and more and never stop. I gotta say that with the special exhibition from my last visit you will learn a lot about this city. And you will know that they are working hard to get to this point of nowadays.
21,5.0,"I was actually looking for the free taekwando demonstration (supposelly in Gyeonghuigung according to my guide book) but it has been moved to Namsangol since last year. This museum was just next to the palace and I entered just to have a look. It was a really nice surprise!Close to Gyeongbokgung and Gwanghwamun, this museum is a nice introduction to Seoul history. Free entrance and a lot of maps which explain the evolution of Korea. You can also see a lot of old pictures (beginning of the XX century) and an impressive model of Seoul (size 1/500). If you have time after visiting of Gyeongbokgung, I'd definitelly recommend to go untill there. They also have a nice garden where you can enjoy a coffee or a cup of tea.To go there, go at the end of Gwanghamun square (where the statue of the Korean warrior is) and walk to your right for around 500m."
22,5.0,"This museum which is free allows give you a glance of why Seoul was founded there and the struggle that it has suffer over the years by the invasion of Chinese and Japanese to the city. Also the museography is really nice as it reproduce in a model the life one of the most important street of the city where all merchants were located and finally they tell you that you walk until now a days in that street which is jongno.Another interesting part is the model of Seoul now a days in a scale 1:50000, in here you can appreciate the size of the city and the density of the city.I think that a visit on the first they of your stay in Seoul would allow you to understand better the city and its different areas."
23,4.0,"This free museum highlights Seoul and its evolution over the years.  As you walk through it is interesting to see how much the city has changed and grown in about 100 years. Even the photos from the past couple of decades are interesting.  I'd say about 95% of the exhibits have English but there are some that only have Korean which makes me wonder if it is kind of masking things that they might not want known to many others countries' visitors, for example, the ""food shortage"" section was only in Korean but almost everything else had English translations.  There's one room where you see an aerial view of present day Seoul and can even try to find where you're staying.  About an hour is good enough time to spend at this museum."
24,5.0,This is a truly impressive free museum.   The exhibits are extremely well done.   You will need at least two hours.   Don't miss the model of the modern city..very captivating.
