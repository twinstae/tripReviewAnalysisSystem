It's nicely set up and they had sealife that I had never seen in my life. I got a ticket online at Klook, which saved me about 20-25%. You can also get a flyer at the mall with a 15% discount coupon. The feedings are done by divers. The mermaid show I really wanted to see and waited around for an hour or so was a dissapointment...the 'mermaids' only swam up and down two or three times and then turnes into humans because that was their wish...I also didn't like the touching lab as I saw kids grabbingfish, starfish, poking them and taking them out and throwing them back in, no supervision. Other than that, great aquarium!!!"
1,5.0,"I paid full price for ticket 28,000 not realising there is online discount I would have paid less. It wasn’t originally on my plan of places to go but a rainy day brought me to Coex. The aquarium is really great with lots of varieties of fish I have never seen before being from Europe. It’s really kid friendly and you can learn a lot from the signs that are in korean and english! Really enjoyed it as a solo traveler."
2,5.0,"Went on a rainy day and it was super fun :) a huge variety of fish and small animals, a very well designed halls  ( great to take pictures ) Worth it"
3,3.0,"This aquarium is nothing special at all. Do not expect to be wowed by anything unique or creative. Unless you have never been to an aquarium or have children that demand you take them there, do not waste your time and skip this activity. There are better things to do in Seoul."
4,4.0,"If you like aquariums, it is a must-see in Seoul. I liked to visit the aquarium whilst in Seoul (especially when the weather was bad and the parks were wet). This was my second visit and there was no noticeable change. However, watching the various creatures in the aquarium was quite relaxing and entertaining. This time, I tried to refine my camera skills for shooting tropical fishes; the results were not bad."
5,3.0,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam area of Seoul is one of the largest aquariums in South Korea, it boasts having over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. Its nicely laid out with a well signed route which snakes its way through the various tanks and exhibits, most of the tanks have write ups in English. There are a lot of fun little activities dotted around for younger children to enjoy, although these are more geared to speakers of Korean. Not all the exhibits are aqautic, I walked around one corner to find a rabbit!! Highlights - The under ""sea"" tunnel, the jellyfish tanks and the otters."
6,5.0,The price is a bit expensive if you're on a a budget but I think it's well worth it. The aquarium is so quirky with some of the displays but also very good at taking care of the animals. There are lots of different exhibits and activities to take part in this place would be especially good of you have children traveling with you as they would in my opinion love it. Plenty of bathrooms and vending machines so was never thirsty or needing the loo. All of the staff that I encountered were very nice too
7,5.0,"The place was surprisingly bigger than I expected and they have a huge variety of species on display. The displays were organized and has a theme which was interesting. There was an experiential part of the aquarium where visitors get a chance to get close and even touch the creatures. However, there was no staff to supervise the visitors. There are also rest areas for families with children and vendo machines to buy refreshments. They also have a scheduled shows.The place is great  for families, couples, and even for solo travellers. There is more to this place than just fish so be sure to visit. It is also very near SM Town musuem."
8,4.0,"It is surprisingly large given that it is situated inside the COEX, an expensive place in the heart of the city. I had visited numerous large aquariums but still managed to find something interesting. There was a locker facility (at a small charge) and that was helpful. The staff were particularly helpful although they did not speak much English."
9,3.0,"It was an ok experience, but way too expensive for what it has to offer. Not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w."
10,4.0,"Many species. Not only under sea habitats. So very interesting, large main pool with big sharks and turtles. Worth it"
11,4.0,Visited this Aquarium alone at Coex mall. Centrally located and provide best view of all varieties of marine life's. Best time to go alone with friends and family members.
12,4.0,I visited the Coex Aquarium with a friend. There were plenty of different types of fishes and is an interesting place for fish lovers. I’m posting photos to show the fishes.
13,4.0,"Prefer this aquarium to lotte world aquarium, since it felt as though it was larger and had a larger variety of marine lives. A lot of thinking seemed to have been placed into the designing of the aquarium's layout and furnishing to elude an air of cozy ambiance throughout the visit, even though I felt that some tanks might be too children-friendly for adults - had to squat down at most of the first section. The staff at the ticket counter could have been friendlier as well, as she looked irritated when she found out that I couldn't understand Korean and that she had to repeat herself in another language."
14,5.0,"I visited this Coex aquarium on the last day at Seoul after attending a conference. After checking out at the hotel, I could take the hand luggage into the aquarium and walk around (that was the reason - to pass time while hanging on to my hand luggage). Within the coex mall the aquarium is nicely planned with lot of species - sharks, penguins, live corals. Full price is high, but you get instant 15% discount with the coupon you find there. I guess the locals get better discounts when they bring their kids.It takes about two hours to see the aquarium leisurely. There are places inside to sit and watch the marine life for longer. It cannot be any better."
15,5.0,"My expectations were low for an aquarium in a shopping mall, but the Coex Aquarium houses an incredible variety of animals."
16,2.0,"I truly enjoyed the aquarium and the way they had some of their displays set up. The only downside for me was that there were several very young school groups who were all yelling and running. They have one spot where they play soothing music and you can fit in front of a massive aquarium where sharks and rays glide by in front of you. It would have been a great spot to sit and video the beautiful creatures but there several groups of very loud teenage Korean boys running through it ruining your video and generally ruining the whole feeling. It would have been an awesome experience if the staff had maintained some kind of order, but most of them appeared to be high school kids themselves."
17,5.0,I have been to several aquariums but this is by far the best. Great tour inside plus a show as well!! Nice experience for people of ALL ages!
18,4.0,"Aquarium is in the Coex Mall. Great use of mirrors makes it look much bigger than it is.Some clever displays such as panels in drink vending machines, in old phone boxes, household items for smaller fish.I spent 2.5hrs there and enjoyed it. Good variety of fish and animals such as otters, prairie dogs, bats and squirrels.  Sharks are a decent size as are the rays. The manatees were my favorite though.  Compared to other aquariums this is overpriced.  It cost 2500 won to enter. A nice way to spend a few hrs. Accessible from the green line Sameosung station."
19,3.0,"This Aquarium has some Limited Species of Fishes, it is Not that Attractive and a bit Pricey on the Entry Fee.It might Excite the Kids to see some Fishes, but not worth the Entry fee."
20,5.0,Family outing in COEX mall would never want to miss out the fun and educational aquarium. Note the feeding timetable for various locations if you like to witness the real time feeding fun.
21,5.0,"great aquarium and it's at the mall!. one of the few places with manatees and you can see them up close.one part even has weird fish tanks like kitchen sinks,telephone booths,washing machines etc.planning on going back"
22,3.0,"A small scale aquarium in the COEX mall.  There are many kind of fishes and sea creatures (including seals and penguins).  Quite interestingly, there are also some “non-sea creatures”, for example, monkey, rabbits,…etc.I spent a 2 hours’ happy time at the aquarium.  If you have extra time, especially on a rainy day, it is a good place to visit."
23,4.0,"First I thought it was a small place, but was surprised about how big it actually was. They have some great things for kids, they can touch some of the fish, see how they lay eggs, hatch and a special place with jellyfish. Not only fish, they have seals, manatees, penguins, otters, a croc, turtles and a lot more than I would expect. Though it's in a mall, the whole thing is quite big with a big tank and a glass tunnel. Kids will love this place, and so did I."
24,5.0,"Went here with my boyfriend. It's very interesting! First they start of with small aquariums, but the further in you go the bigger it gets. The sharks was very interesting to see!"
25,2.0,"it was so crowd i could not see half of fishes and great number of kid less then one year old...screaming crying those who could running, parents brining baby cares of course, the baby cares are very helpful in crowd you can push with it all people around. it is painful tho think how all oh those creatures exist in that hell all their life,  show which they announced  well....girls under the water making ege (stupid face which pretend to be cute and strange moving with hands close to face) and divers making heart shape with arms.....and all this hell going on in extremely crowd i would leave but just should stay because it was impossible. what surprised me more then greediness is cruelty they scare those creatures who hiding from people from behind so they coming to the front...then again scaring from all that screaming and shouting again hiding and again some scary sounds coming and and again they running in panic back to front....is it smart ? is is what for you use your brain dear owners of Coex Aquarium?"
26,5.0,Coex Aquarium s located inside the coex mall. In the beginning of the visit I though that was so bad experience but the visit along the way is getting better and better. The high point is the sardines show. A very nice place to take children!
27,2.0,"inside a Huge mall, you will need 20min to find it since it's deep down, the ticket is for 20Euros, the tour can be done in 30min, in the morning you will find School kids with there teachers, it has a nice introduction to sea life"
28,3.0,"On a work trip so decided to drop by, the shows were average and was hoping to see a bigger tank (I was comparing to my experience in Osaka and Singapore aquariums). Entrance fee is 22,000 won, that said they made the whole experience very convenient, with multiple lockers, clear signs, interaction with sea creatures etc. it was just smaller than expected."
29,2.0,"I read some reviews about it and I had high expectations about it but unfortunately when I went there i found it normal , nothing special about it and it is even less than normal."
30,4.0,"It's nice place but don't expect to see something special. It's more for kids than adults. However, you should see it when you visit Coex Mall."
31,4.0,"A lot larger than I expected. Great collection of fish, and a nice break from wandering the cavernous mall and losing money at the casino (slots only!)"
32,3.0,"After 5 years in Korea, I finally gave in an went to Coex Aquarium with my boyfriend's sister and nieces. In all honesty, I've never been a fan of aquariums, but this one is nothing special. It's crowded, the tanks are too small for many of the larger fish/mammals and most people are more interested in taking photos of themselves at the aquarium that actually looking at anything. There are other (better) sites to see in Seoul (and Korea) that are cheaper and a far better use of time."
33,5.0,"Coex Aquarium is huge aquarium, and has a lot of different kinds of sea animals. Sharks are the main icon of the aquarium. The restaurant Deep Blue will offer great experience to you."
34,4.0,Good to see some very cute looking fish tanks. Not an enormous aquarium but big enough for me to walk around and relax looking at the fishes swim.
