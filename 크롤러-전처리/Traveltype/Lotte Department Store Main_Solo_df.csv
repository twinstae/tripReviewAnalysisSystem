0,1.0,"Well, tonight I have very bad experience on MAC cosmetics counter in Lotte Department Store ever as a tourist in a quite luxury place with some other luxury brands inside together. The girl staff in cashier looked to inside my wallet 'twice', somebody in charge who see this review just check your cctv, I'm sure all recorded,it was around 8:15 pm until 08:30 pm, November 22nd, 2019, before I paid and after I paid and gave the money to her friend, they don't speak English well also, and nobody said sorry at all. Is it their manners sell as quick as possible without consideration to serve customer well as I am as a tourist??? For sure I won't be back to this cosmetic counter ever, when I visit Seoul next time. Here I put a picture of the receipts showing time and date of purchase."
1,4.0,You can find everything in this mall Mall that is close to Seoul Station. Very easy to get and also very large to shopping in.
2,4.0,"The mall is huge and will take a few hours at least to walk though every level and every wing.Lots of international brands and boutiques charging prices that are more or less the same anywhere else in Asia, even if you factor in the tax rebate.  There are some floors dedicated to local designers and brands and even those seemed very pricey to me.  I looked at some casual weekend dresses and that ranged from about KRW 250k (USD 200) and upwards going to multiples of that amount. The best part of this mall is the basement food level.  Lots to see and choose and try. Similar to the foodhalls you would find in Malls in Tokyo or Harrods in London.  I enjoyed browsing and choosing gifts for friends and family. I snacked on quite a few things as I went along. Lovely few hours I spend in there but did actually buy much other than food and gifts."
3,4.0,"Came here on Korea’s Memorial Day and there were many shoppers, mainly Mainland Chinese tourists. It is mainly the high end stuff, such as cosmetics and clothing they come for."
4,3.0,It’s a nice upmarket store with some high end brands. It’s not so where to go looking for great shopping bargains. Quick visit to realize out of my price range
5,4.0,Wonderfully decorated and presented.  The most caring and beautiful people everywhere to help you.  I was amazed at attentive every clerk was to my questions and needs.
6,3.0,"It's department store without any retailers' shop inside. I was looking for merrel shoes here, but it seems like in Korea shoes size 8 is too big for them. They said7.5 is the biggest, 8 is too difficult to sales, What!!!"
7,4.0,"Duty Free, check!Variety of food in its foodcourt, check!Grocery shopping, check! High end and millenial shopping departments, check! No wonder a lot of tourists flock to this mall for great food and shopping that caters to young and mature customers alike. There is a good Japanese resto in Avenue L that is a good discovery. Or if you just want to ease hunger pangs then it is the food court where a Japanese conveyor belt sushi can be found or traditional Korean food or Chinese and Asian delights as well, not to mention endless well loved street food snacks in the convenience of a Mall. Coffee-holics and dessert hounds? You’ll surely find the relaxing atmosphere at the basement your thing. It is a good respite from the shop-a-holics of Myeongdong."
8,5.0,There are several Lotte department stores. This in the Myeongdong seems to be the most luxuruous one. In the same building there seem to show the global brands. Tax free Trade seems to be worthwhile because there are some floors dedicated to it.
9,4.0,Centrally located. Possible to find everything in many different shops. Especially food court in basement floor presents many tasty selections. Prices are above medium. Worth visiting.
10,4.0,"Lotte department store, Lotte Young Plaza and Avenue are all interconnected so you can shop comfortably in air conditioned space. There are food halls and clean modern washrooms in all 3."
11,2.0,"Spent few days in Seoul for Business purposes and as it was next to the hotel went there in order to check out any eventual bar gains...Was a quite disappointing experience as it was overcrowded, people pretty aggressive and when checking out the prices couldn't find anything worthyIn my opinion spend your time somewhere else"
12,4.0,"The mall won't open until 10:30 so it's not something for those who wake up early.The mall also have 2 floors full of duty free counters, though I think it's possible to find these products cheaper even with tax, if you have time to shop around.Overall a nice, would come again when travel with my girlfriend."
13,5.0,"The mall has got everything from apparels to household to food and groceries. In short, this mall is for the whole family of all ages.The highlight is the baby room on level 7, not only was it fully equipped with the necessary (changing stations, hot and cold water dispenser, etc), it provides all necessities such as wipes, diapers, creams, even a cot room for your child to catch a wink. The amenities offered were so comprehensive that any parent can just show up with a child, without bringing anything else."
14,4.0,"I don't like to shop much but the Lotte department store is definitely a place to see if you are visiting Seoul. It is enormous with beautiful clean and organized facilities. There are all kinds of shopping options though it is pricey. It's also located within the complex of Lotte attractions so there are all kinds of things to do nearby (nature park on a large pond, amusement park, aquarium, etc) for those who don't wish to shop."
15,5.0,"This is the Store of Seoul. This time, I have seen so many more pretty things from France than ever before, which more than a decade ago.  The duty free shop on top floors were replaced by visitors from China rather than Japanese tourist as before.Not much of a shopper these days, in my tender age, I didn't get to see everything but food court was a necessary visit. I gave 5 star rating for it being the hub-bub of MyeongDong attraction. Things can be more pricy compared to other areas in Seoul.  I am glad that the place maintained its popularity and evolved to cater the younger crowds & foreign visitors as even for choice of food in the lower floors.Somewhat crowded but this is the story of Seoul.I give credit to Koreans that tried their best to meet up to the standards of westerner or foreign visitors."
16,3.0,Lotte Department Store Main is in Namdaemun which is easy accessible on foot from Myeongdong. Mature clients are their main target.
17,4.0,"In terms of budget shopping, this isn't somewhere you would necessarily go to, but I wouldn't say the things are completely expensive. The food court + supermarket was definitely a highlight."
18,3.0,"Almost everything can be found here, however its not cheap. Easily accessible, can take a look around if you have the time."
19,4.0,"This is a huge luxury shopping mall with a lot of high end brands - think Burberry, Coach, etc. There is a small supermarket and a food court, as well as some restaurants. Since this mall is higher end, there didn't seem to be too many sales worth going for, even on Black Friday. It's a nice place to walk around though. For younger and more trendy brands, there is the Lotte Young Plaza mall that is attached. You can browse this mall all the way to the top floor and take the walkway over to the Lotte Young Plaza from the cinema."
20,4.0,"If you are looking to get some brandname goods, please visit here. Some staffs could not speak english but they are ready to help (i strongly suggest to get direction or location of particular shops from the interactive sign, as sometime they don't exactly know where it is and gives wrong info).Lotte duty free is always busy and should visit before lunch time.Supermarket on the basement is very busy in the evening and quite small."
21,4.0,"I have been here on all my visits to Seoul.  Not only does it have Korean and luxury brands,  they also have a wing called ""Young World"" where they have youth oriented fashion and designers.  They even have a shop selling Line (Line Messenging app ) character goods.  The only Muji store in the area is located inside Lotte as well.  In the basement,  they have the food emporium with restaurants and vendors selling various foodstuffs.  While not the cheapest option,  1st time visitors who have never experienced a Japanese or Korean department store should check it out."
22,4.0,"There were a lot of fashion, watch, bags etc in the department store, prices were not cheap but lots with good quality. I managed to get some fashion that I liked, bought some stuff from the Lotte Mart, had yummy meals in a restaurant called Bowl in the department store, had a quick tax refund in the same building so I was happy. Just remember every Lotte Department Stores has different operating hours and many close around 8pm. It's good to check if you are a late shopper."
23,3.0,"The service downstairs at the 'normal' stores seems perfectly nice as one expects at this kind of high-end department store. However the customer service changes once you entered the upstairs duty free department. But it's probably due to the free market like atmosphere given by so many tourists at once. Counselling is not possible at this stage, you better get informed before you go there and just grap the things you are looking for. There are also many multipacks offered if not only."
24,5.0,This is a huge store with most brands available. Often crowded on weekends. Ideal for those looking for branded and duty stuffs.
25,3.0,"Massive mall with ten levels of shopping but way too crowded even during off peak hours on weekdays. There were big groups crowding around the more popular cosmetic counters like Sulwhasoo. The food court was really packed and the prices were on the high side as well. It really felt like a war zone with people just pushing around and I didn't enjoy shopping there, I'll go to other malls which are not as crowded."
26,4.0,"Two large buildings connected with many shopping choices and a very well kept food court with many choices in food. Food is a bit more expensive here but you're paying for quality food with excellent service. There are also a lot of different stores for shopping including a one-of-a-king Kakao Friends store which sells the hottest characters in South Korea right now. If you're looking for the department store setting, coming here is a must. It even connects to the subway system so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. The establishment also has their own aquarium and Lotte Mart (Walmart equivalent) and a larger basement food court. Quite an eye-opener."
27,5.0,They Have many lotte malls and shops where I live in Jakarta.  It was refreshing to see them in south Korea too where they are booming. They also have lotte world here and lotte hotels! The world is going lotte mad! Pay a visit just to say you've been and experienced it!
28,4.0,"If you willing to buy a lot of stuff, you should go to the lotte duty free.Most of the brands are high end and still expensive (for the luxury bags), but if you want to get korean beauty products in low price, it's the best place even if they don't have all of the brand in it (such as odbo or clio)"
29,4.0,"Really a paradise, especially the duty free with special amazing prices. I wish they have more brands and clothes at duty free. But it is too crowded and payment is separated at each store so it takes a lot of time in queue waiting to check out at each store."
30,3.0,"The Lotte Department Store main branch is prominently located in the hotspot and busy shopping district of Myeongdong. It is the largest department store in Korea offering high-end shopping to Koreans as well as visitors. It is directly connected to Lotte Hotel Seoul and is 5 minutes by foot from my Hotel, The Westin Chosen Seoul.You will find in the building a a wide variety of goods from reasonably priced Korean labels to world-famous luxury brands and also a duty-free shop. The food court located on lower level is huge. Lot of restaurants and food brands.The store is opened every day from 10.30am to 8pm."
31,4.0,"The Lotte Duty free is great for me because many of the luxury items that I love are not popular with Chinese tourists or Koreans. This means that luxury items that might be full price in New York are being offered at a discount in Korea.I've purchased designer frames, bags, watches, skincare, etc.  All great deals and so convenient to retrieve before your flight. You can take the Korean brands home with you on the day of purchase.It's worth the trip...Don't go on the weekends unless you are wearing mental armor."
32,4.0,There is certainly a lot on offer here. the best part for me was the food court in the basement. Worth a look.
33,4.0,"I'm American, and I frequent places like 5th Ave in NYC, Michigan Ave in Chicago, and Rodeo Drive - luxury, right?No.Lotte mall is ridiculous.  How you have all the luxury brands all on top of each other in one building is insane.  Who buys all this stuff?  Apparently, lots of people do, bc the place is packed with buyers, not just shoppers!If you are a foreigner, go upstairs to the duty free floors, where the best deals are.  The supermarket downstairs is cool to check out, and it's also the best place to get something to eat, like at the noodle bars.  Don't eat on the higher floors - it's overpriced and underwhelming.There are also 2 related malls next door with more designer goods, and the other one caters to the younger set.If you're American, realize that English isn't a standard out there, so you'll have some difficulty."
34,4.0,"Cosmetic on top floor - some how the price is lower than shops in Myendong street.Sometimes, can get additional 10% off during sales or credit card promotion like using Visa card.Love the supermarket on the Basement floor. All the instant noodles, pork meat in can and Korean products can be found here."
