It's conveniently connected to the subway and they offer variety of restaurants and stores like Zara, Bershka, Mac makeup store, Uniqlo and other Korean brand stores. I love hanging out here and meet with friends. There are great restaurants on the upper floors! Anyone visiting Seoul should check this place out."
1,4.0,"I was staying just within the mall complex...great for transportation, as the metro is below and once you figured out the metro line system, this is actually a good spot to head out to different places. Shopping is basically all about brand names and you can anywhere else for that. For eats you find a lot of junk food a well, such as Taco Bell, Mc Donald's or more, but the food court, even though far from what Lotte offers is pretty good. High quality, clean and sweet service, even if you cannot communicate with them, in case you do not speak Korean....I will add additional reviews on some of the places, but I recommend you check it out!"
2,5.0,I am a huge fan of D-Cube city.  I always enjoy spending a day shopping here.  It has a lot of shops and you are sure to find what you are looking for.  There is also Pororo land which is a huge hit with the kids.  There is something for everyone here~~
