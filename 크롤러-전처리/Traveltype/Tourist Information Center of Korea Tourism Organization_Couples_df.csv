0,5.0,"This centre occupies the 2nd to 5th floor- within an office building complex. The tourists information centre is on the 2nd floor, with a small cafe within.Every floor has a different aspect showcasing rich Korean cultures ie Korean cuisines, history, cultures, etc.On the 5th Cultural products promo centre, visitors used free coupons to put on hanbok & take pictures. Also another sector to try out making a personalised character strap or magnet.However, the staff at both the hanbok & especially the handicraft sections( 2 young girls) are not very friendly. Makes us feel unwelcome with their cold attitudes!Seems like they don't like foreign tourists - an irony as to why this place is set up for ie to promote understanding of Korean cultures to foreigners/tourists. They are not warm nor helpful when you ask something.But the lady on the information counter on 3rd floor Culinary culture exhibition section was the extreme opposite. Very warm, friendly, helpful & always smile when see guests. She gave us the free coupons for 5th floor events without us even asking.So was the guy on the 2nd floor information counter ( English).Definitely we would recommend s trip here if in Seoul."
1,5.0,I want to thank the staff that is on the streets of Seoul. You can usually find them wearing cowboy hats. We were lost and found them. They called several shops to make sure they carried what we were looking for. Gave us bus direction and found the number of the bus we needed to take as well as writing the information in Korean for us. You can't get better service then that. I want to thank Noh Jiyoung  and An Kwangwoo your kindness. Your help was greatly appreciated and without them we would have been lost.

Go for hanbok wearing experience on the fifth floor where you can either wear the hanbok of your choice and take photos inside the Centre or wear outside for an hour. Wish the staff at that the hanbok section could be friendlier. Could hear them murmuring ""so annoying"" in korean without a smile and that's not nice especially that's a tourist center. To be honest if you want to impress and attract tourists as the purpose of this centre, please hire staffs who can give good impression."

It offers individually prepared Korean dishes while you wait and watch. The staff are fantastic explaining what goes into each dish and willing to help you make your selection (s). Meals are prepared,  in an open kitchen as you watch if you choose, from all fresh ingredients. Seating are  bench style tables with comfortable padding and can accommodate up to eight diners. A separate banquet room is available for demonstrations and/or dining. Interested in learning Korean preparation, cooking classes are also available.Overall an excellent meal and experience."
4,4.0,"We alighted at Jonggak station Line 1 to K-Style Hub, immediately as our 1st destination.  This de facto the Korea Tourism Place is fast becoming a famous attraction that is less known to most international tourists! It is a one-stop complex provides information to meet all tourists' needs.  Beyond just a tourist information center there are exhibition halls and even sales of local specialty products! The hub is divided into 4 segments, with the Tourist Information Center found at second level, Korean Food Exhibition and Experience Halls on the third and forth levels respectively, and an Art Market Hall on the 5th level. We spent some time at L2 asking the officers for some tourist advice and also to take a break/rest.  Browsing through the many brochures while sipping our (Korean) latte.! Can even see part of the Cheonggyecheon Stream.  Only visited the 3rd level to get some souvenirs at the Korean Food Culture Exhibition Hall. There’s simple food sampling, hands-on and explanation of the famed Korean ginseng & kimichi too. Good for a 1st introduction to Korea’s diverse experience!Do watch this place as it is very likely to move-up the must-visit in Seoul soon."
