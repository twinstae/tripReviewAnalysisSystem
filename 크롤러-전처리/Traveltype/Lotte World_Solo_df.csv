I also found it disappointing that pretty much every outdoor ride shuts down when it rains. I understand safety must come first, but it was disappointing to have bought a fast pass and not be able to ride any of the rides I wanted to. I'm glad I went just to see it, but I wouldn't go back."
1,5.0,"117 floors in 1 minute! Super modern. Located in Gangnam district. Quite expensive entrance if you want to get to the top, compare to the prices in Seoul."
2,5.0,If you wanna spend one evening with your friends in way cool I recommend you Lotte World. It is cheap and you need a whole day
3,4.0,"This shopping mall was directly across from my hotel , and even though I hate shopping I had to have a peek . A massive shopping centre with about everything you could want to but all under one roof . Also some very nice restaurants and food stalls with some very nice snacks . Electronics, food and clothes for every occasion. I must visit for those who like to shop ."
4,4.0,"Here, Lotte World, is one of the biggest theme park in Korea. Although it is smaller than Everland, it has more thril rides here. Personally recommand French Revolution, Gyro Swing, and Atlantis for adults. Most of the other rides are for children/family. And be prepared for very long lines and harsh prices of foods."
5,3.0,"Though I don't ride all the rides, I just embraced the view and surrounding, a moment when you wish you are young again. I don't think is as big as Everland that I heard of bring a huge place, but since here, the location is great and accessible by using metro when you do not have enough time while in Seoul but just enough to experience the moment of being young at heart."
6,5.0,"So i went on a friday and it was very crowded with a kids in school visits but the rides on the outdoor are the best for adults , if you have kids and want them to have some fun go indoor.The lines in the outdoor are long and tiring however the rides are very enjoyable.You are advised to go from tuesday to thursday if you want to avoid crowds and also avoid public holidays at all costs."
7,4.0,Disney meets asia with this gem.From water slides to roller coasters along with a massive ice skating ring this little commercial gem will not disappoint. The flying advertising drones do not distract and are a fun part of the ambiance.Plenty to see and interaction makes for a fun family experience.
8,3.0,"The mall has everything you need and big shops, also a cinema. With the biggest display in the world.But the price for parking and the parking situation on busy days is ridiculous and a poor statement. Also the food market is on busy days too full. With the good restaurants you have to wait an hour."
9,4.0,"This is an ok theme park. Appreciated that there is an indoor area when the weather gets too hot or rainy during the summer season. Went on a Friday and was quite surprised that the queues were not that long. Though the park was quite big, I find that there are more things to do at Everland. Enjoyed the street and stage performances throughout the day. The food choices are ok. Would have been better if the park access includes the skating rink area as I believe it costs extra to try out."
10,5.0,"A good place people must visit, there is everything from food, groceries, restaurants, electronic, audio, white goods, good quality garments etc. etc..During the visit I was lucky because there was 50% discount on garments like Zara and others, even on sport garments."
11,4.0,If you want to see and indooe park this is really cute. If ypu have children they will love to go to this place. Have a really beutiful parade at night during the cold weather. Have a reallu cute park for toddlers and they have theynown rides in really cute. I did it at night because i want to take some pictures but not to ride in any attractions. It have an out door island that have rides for adults a lot of really great food. It has restaurants too. Theprice of the entres depends of what time you go too. If you go really late at night is cheaper but you have a of less time in it.
12,4.0,"Went to this place on a holiday expecting it to be somewhat slow. It was busy. Many good rides, but the cues for the roller coasters were too long. The rides I do ride were very fun and had an almost ""Disney"" level of quality to the attractions. The food was also very good. I ate way too much. My only disappointment was TGIFriday's on the 1st floor (ground floor)."
13,3.0,"I read so many good reviews about this place so I had big expectations. Well, it didnt meet them. Don't get me wrong, park is nice and have some good rides but nothing impressive. There is for sure better adventure parks like Six Flags or Disney World. Food inside is very cheap so thats good. As a tip, go after 4pm because they have a special rate and also rides are less busier. Park closes at 11pm so you will have enough time to do some rides."
14,3.0,The day i was there it was raining so..... Only half of the attractions were open. Inside is pretty filled to the brim with rides but it's mostly for little kids. I'd say middle school at the oldest. Lot of 4Dish rides... For the price you could do worse.
15,3.0,"Good attraction to visit. Many games and rides available for different rages for ages. Easy to reach by metro or taxi or buss . Verity of Resturant's around . Recommend place to visit ,"
16,4.0,"The place is impressive, we can not argue about it. But it is really really crowded. It's basically covered with people they are everywhere. Long long long lines. I have waited for 2 hours for a 7 minuted ride. Download application and try not to go crazy."
17,5.0,"This is amazing place. I absolutely love it. I'd definitely go there again. If you love carousels, slides and different entertainment, you'll love it here. But be ready for long queues. I spent more time waiting in line than riding. The staff are friendly but English is a problem for the local population. And in case it's not cheap. Plus you probably will spend some money for ice cream or a sandwich, all this and more you can buy there easily. Just be sure you have enough money."
18,5.0,"Wuahuu, it's not just a mall it's also like a indoor disney world, it's just perfect for a winter day in seoul, with shops and restaurant, supermarket and a huge park for children and adult"
19,4.0,"Yes, from branded to local stuff. You can get everything you in the place. There is a supermarket even called Lotte Mart next door."
20,4.0,"This seemed like a fun place to go after seeing the park in running man.  Is quite a big park and has its charm. If definitely needs a fast pass system as there's so many people at the park.  The best ride is the excaliber rollercoaster.  It was raining so i couldn't do the outside rides thoughTo be honest, most of the rides were not as compared to their disney/universal counterparts,  but still worth a trip visiting if you're in gangnam"
21,4.0,"I love going to theme parks. When I learned that this is the largest indoor theme park, Planned to go there.  This amusement park is linked by monorail, shopping malls, a luxury hotel, a Korean folk museum, sports facilities, and movie theaters all in one place.The entrance fee to this theme park is 52,000 won.   It has a huge skating rink, various rides.Rode the 3 WILD TOURS –namely WILD WING, WILD JUNGLE and WILD VALLEY.  These are3-D rides.  Since it is almost Halloween when I went there, huge pumpkin, pumpkin characters, carriage.different attraction inside the theme park.  Spectacular roof… Rode “Lotty’s Air Balloon” which is like riding in a hot air balloon.  I saw an aerial view of the whole place."
22,4.0,"There are many activities, ice link and folk museum etc. that you can enjoy there for  hours. Especially, it's a lovely place for kids! The line 8 stops at jamsil station."
23,4.0,"This Place will remind you of the Theme Parks that you visited during your Childhood Days, But this one is much Advanced and better than the Ones you ever visited. It has amazing Rides and eye Catching Attractions which will tempt you to test your Limits, it will ignite the Long Lost Adventure seeking individual inside you."
24,5.0,The time i visit was perfect since they have the zombie island at the magic island area. They scattered zombies at certain areas which was fun. Some children were crying of course since they were afraid. I love the rides but there is a long qeue so if dont want to line up. Just download their magic pass app in your phone apps store.
25,3.0,"Fascinating since a lot of the park is inside, however the rides are a little disappointing and there aren't a lot of them."
26,4.0,"Loved the idea of going to an indoor theme park on a hot, sunny day. I went on a Thursday, during Chuseok (public holiday), because of the foreigner discount (25,000won). The crowds got bigger and bigger by early afternoon so that all the rides were 30min-2hr long waits. Some rides even closed the fast pass lane. Then again, I remember waiting in long lines at other theme parks in Orlando. I suggest you look at the guide map to see which rides you are interested in to save time. There are plenty of thriller rides, contrary to what I read on other posts. There was a zombie theme going on in Magic Island (the outdoor part) so there were people dressed up as zombies running around. I would like to go again on a cooler, less busier day to check out the outdoor section as it was way too crowded when I went at sunset."
27,3.0,"It is more for children.  There were 3 roller coasters that are decent, one was down while I was there.  And the 2 coasters had an hour wait each.  There were a few other decent rides, but nothing special.  Go if you have children, otherwise not worth it.  They have a Magic Pass that allows you to skip the line 5 times during your stay.  It is 30,000 won, as much as it is pricy, waiting in line sucks."
28,5.0,"As my title speak, the theme park is brilliantly designed for all age groups.Gyro Drop is the star attraction. Atlantis roller coaster, gyro swing and others are worth trying out. Lot of emphasis to the kids section & kids love it.Cons: Nothing as per my notice."
29,5.0,"great place to visit. cool rides.had fun even going solo,got to cut to the front of the line.price is about the same as six flags.not as many roller coasters but cool indoor park."
30,5.0,"This is probably the biggest entertainment complex in seoul.  You have from low end to high end products in this cpomplex, from cheap food to expensive restaurant.  Indoor amusement park and indoor aquarium in the same complex.  Its beyond real.  You need days to finish it all.  Good with kids and family."
31,5.0,"This is just another amusement park. So what makes it different from the rest? Maybe the best part is lotte world have both indoor and outdoor rides. I extremely love the outdoor GYRO rides; GYRO Drop, GYRO Swing. Thrilling & exciting! As for the indoor rides, The Conquistador seems to be my top choice. This is my personal preference so it may not be the same for everyone."
32,4.0,"Absolutely huge mall and entertainment center. Lots of places to go, with friends, family or alone. Good for shopping, leisure activities and relax."
33,1.0,"the park is run by idiots,some attractions can't be ridden as its ""Mobile app reservation system only"". (why such stupid idea exist in the first place anyway, just queuing up runs well in every theme-parks)however their android app isn't working, so it means android users can't ride those attractions.what a disgrace to android users & people without smartphone/ with limited storage smartphone.the park itself isn't great, nothing special and quite small.will never come to you again."
34,5.0,"very good place, very big place when you can spend all day their, good for family and all type of traveler, i spend 4hrs  without feeling the time"
35,4.0,"More adapted for the younger ages, some rides are still suited for the older ones. The gyro drop is definitely my favorite."
36,5.0,"The queues are better than at Disney, you can easily do a lot of attractions in a day. Quite affordable."
37,2.0,"So expensive, Games aren't that good, the only adventurous games are interesting, but it's expensive compared to the Games, if you want to lose your day there, but the metro station to Lotte word is a piece of Art mini Roma style ,"
38,2.0,lotte world used to be a fantasy place for kids but people in the know know this place is managed pretty dismally. safety issues used to haunt this place while the rides are run-of-the-mill at best. dismal parking space. still a jamsil landmark no doubt.
39,4.0,"I went out of curiosity. Fun to walk around, esp. The folk museum. Definitely for the 3-19 yr. group, which looked to be enjoying themselves a lot. Lots of schoolkids in their uniforms and young families. Ambitious to have an ice rink, carousel, rides indoors and the crazy gyro rides outdoors."
40,3.0,"Prefer everland to lotte world! Frankly speaking there is nothing much to do here! Place is old and run down, queue for rides is expected very long! Overpriced food and souveniers!"
41,3.0,"This isn't the best amusement park of Korea. You should visit Everland in Yongin. Though they open during the night, but your selection would be limited. Get this place as early as possible, because it would soon be crowded."
42,4.0,"It is a marge amusement park with everything you expect: attractions, restaurants, shows. It is a great place but it is also very crowded and you may have to wait for several hours to go to one attraction.I just went around without doing any of these attractions."
43,2.0,"Lotte world is a huge place with a ""few"" attractions of class but watch out!!! The queuing time is most of the time between 45-120 minutes so you will fast be disappointed. We bought a ticket valid from 5 PM including free rides on all attractions. Well inside did we fast understand that we would ONLY manage to ride maximum 2 of the attractions because the also close all attractions during 45 minutes because of some kind of silly parade. Another thing is that many of the attractions are old and slow, not fancy or really exciting (except for the French connection - a roller coaster where the waiting time was 110 minutes). My advice is that you spend your time somewhere else in lovely Seoul."
44,3.0,"Although the theme park is an old friend, and one I like to visit, this time I went next door to the newly completed mall (the tower is still under construction).This shopping mall has been plagued by many problems about construction and dealines, but is finally open to the public as of the middle of November 2014.Could some of the things I mention here be a part of the teething problems? Probably, and I hope they will be fixed before my next visit.First of all, I have to say that the architecture is splendid, along the lines of making all customers believe they have entered a treasure cave. Marble floors and pillars, gilded bannisters and trims, fairy lights - it all combines to turn the space into the inside of a glaring white disco ball. I longed for some muted colors and corners, someplace less white and gleaming and glaring, but maybe that's just my personal taste.What I can commend them on is adequate signage - everywhere you look are signs directing you to the subway lines, the movie theatres, the aquarium, the shops, the food courts etc. There are also plenty of automated info screens that you can use to search for a place - and in plenty of languages. Very tourist-friendly.But - no indications as to how far you'll have to walk, and believe me, you will have to walk quite a way. Also no indications about restrooms except one. Most of the shops were still unpacking and setting up, and those that were up and running had an eager air about them. I'm not sure what they are paying to rent space, but I'm sure it will be reflected in their prices.As for spaces where a person can just sire down for a moment and rest before tackling the rest, not in evidence! Unless you enter a restaurant you are not going to catch your breath unless you sit on the floor. If you have such a large space, you need to provide such an amenity.Is it worth a visit? Yes, possibly to visit the aquarium and the movie theatre. Will it have stuff you can't find anywhere else? Maybe, but it doesn't look like it at this stage."
45,4.0,"Spend a day at Lotte World theme park. Take the subway to jamsil (line 2) station. Check out deals online, don't pay full fares at counter. Rides for young and adults."
46,4.0,The indoor park is more attractive than the outdoor one.  It is huge inside with loads of games suitable for kids and grown ups.  Plenty of choices of food at reasonable price.  The souvenir store is a disappointing though...
47,4.0,"I went on a Sunday (probably should have avoided the weekend) but managed to ride all of the adult attractions in a day & really enjoyed myself. Yes the wait in the lines can be quite long but there is wifi & sometimes you can get bumped up the line if you are flying solo.I really recommend the French revolution, Atlantis & Comet express rides if you are into roller-coasters. The food onsite was rather average although the treats (icecream, etc) were good."
48,5.0,"It was like Disney but smaller, it was nice though, I was a bit sick that day but was able to enjoy most of it"
49,4.0,"Ok actually I haven't been into the amusement park. I am afraid of them...I have sat at the rink for hours on end, several times! I am afraid to skate but I have sat there mulling my existence and other worldly matters while watching children learn figure-skating and speed-skating. It is indeed very therapeutic to watch them get better and better with each passing minute. It is free for anyone to head to the rink, sit there and watch for free. You can see glimpses of the amusement park from the seats and several times a day, they will have parades there. Near the rink there is a 7-Eleven, a Lotteria outlet, a Chinese restaurant and a Japanese restaurant.Perhaps someday I will learn to skate and try out this place myself. [Hopefully the cute rink staff I was watching will still be there.]"
