0,5.0,"Really great place, superbly lit for Xmas. Very popular and thus quite busy. You can walk a good 5km or so and there are a numbee of displays along the way."
1,4.0,Great river walk.  Went after dinner and everything was lit up.  Every block had different art pieces.  My favorite was the lantern section.  Got a bit overcrowded in some areas and not as many stairs back up as I would of thought
2,3.0,"Was totally blown away with this ""new"" attraction when i chanced upon it 5 years ago.Its still nice, but i suspect the landscaping & other exhibits seems to have suffered from maintenance budget constraints.I did manage to visit the Cheongyecheon museum. Great place to spend an hour or two. A bit difficult to get to since there's no metro station nearby, but easy enough by taxi or bus. (Get your ""free"" costume picture taken at the photo machine near the entrance door on ground floor. They can even email the picture to you, though for some reason, it does not work for gmail. My friend got his photo on yahoo mail.)"
3,5.0,"Great view for refreshing , weather is good, water is cold, there is a fish .Some street singer is playing some korean songs."
4,5.0,It is a canal walkway below road level with running water in the middle. Pedestrians are evacuated when the water level upstream is too high and needs to be released into the canal thus flooding the canal and the pedestrian path on both sides of the canal. There are plenty of greenery as well as benches and nice theme sections at different sections of the canal. A good relaxation and exercise stretch when in the dongdaemun shopping area. Worth a visit.
5,5.0,Must see! In middle of crazy shopping there is a great restored stream. Beautiful access and tranquil area. Worth stopping and seeing fish with a coffee!
6,5.0,"A 10 km stream in the city of Soul offers relax for everybody - healing stress, cooling area, reading, nature lovers - simply enjoy it."
7,3.0,"We walked past Cheonggyecheon stream to get to Gwangjang market and it seemed to be quite unkempt. Heard from my Korean friends that during winter there are lighting decorations, guess it’s the wrong season to visit."
8,5.0,"A narrow water stream, nice to walk next to it or chill for a bit. Its nice in the morning and night too."
9,5.0,"In the high rising buildings , you can find these kind of natures. Good to go and stay in downtown and walk by the river."
10,5.0,It's a beautiful stream right in the middle of downtown Seoul. I've been there several times. Both day and night. During the day it's a great place to take a relaxing break while sightseeing in the downtown area. It's below street level which keeps down the street noise. You almost forget you're in the city. I especially like it after dark. It's a great place to sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. It's lit with colored lights and images projected on the walls. There are many bars and restaurants in the nearby neighborhood so you can eat then take a relaxing walk along the stream or just sit and listen to the burbling water.
11,4.0,"The stream is a place where you can relax, especially on a warm day.Grab some drinks and food and then just chill. We were there on a Sunday when there were musicians and market stalls close by. The stream starts next to a very cool sculpture and rainbow coloured building - a good landmark to look for."
12,5.0,"Strolling along the stream in the evening was our favorite experience in Seoul!  What a pleasant setting filled with people enjoying the city.  It seems to go on for miles, so you can walk as long or as short as you would like.  Until you take the steps down to the stream, you won't get a sense of the place, which is a refuge from the busy city surrounding it."
13,5.0,"It is a pretty cute area, where you can even dip in your feet in the water. Nice and wide sidewalks to stroll around, ideal for all kinds of travelers, specially at night when the sun is setting."
14,5.0,"Loved taking a leisurely stroll along this urban creek. Its highly developed and right in the middle of the city, plenty of performers and couples dot the shore well into the evening. Though access down to the shore could be easier, as there are specific points you can use, because it's below street level."
15,4.0,"When shopping in Myeongdong, take 5 minutes to walk down the stream for a mindfulness moment (and great photo ops). I wouldn’t say it’s a must do when in Seoul but it is lovely."
16,4.0,"When Seoul is hot and the traffic and confusion on the streets is too much to bear, just find the steps (or occasional elevator) which lead to the cool, quiet Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can wander from City Hall all the way to Dongdaemun Square and along the way enjoy the ceramics depicting ""King Jeongjo's Procession to the Royal Tomb."" And if you find yourself missing the noise and confusion, just take the next flight of steps back up to ground level."
17,4.0,"Started from the start and walked about 4 kms. The first few hundred meters are excellent, after that there was the prominent smell of sewer gas. Nevertheless, better than walking on the street."
18,4.0,This is an amazing urban renewal project turning an otherwise unsightly drain into a beautiful stream and park. The water looked shallow and clean. Both sides of the pedestrian walkway were well paved and landscaped.We approached Cheonggyecheon after exiting Dongdaemun metro station. It was close to midnight on a week night: there were some people sitting by the stream and a few joggers. Absolutely peaceful and such serenity compared to the noisy traffic above.A fantastic place for a leisurely stroll in the evening.
19,3.0,I was really looking forward to seeing this stream but when we got there was a bit disappointed. No art to be seen - just a few traffic cones! Glad we saw it though and still cool to have a stream in the middle of the city that is peaceful.
20,4.0,What a great illustration of the talent and commitment of the korean people. Turning an old piece of infrastructure into this amazing public space. Could not believe how clean it was and how big the fish we  saw in there were ~ 1 to 2 feet
21,4.0,This is a relief in the bustle of the town. A nice walk along a stream with waterfalls and many plants and trees.
22,3.0,If you’re out of things to do this a nice break from the commotion. It’s a peaceful area to walk in. With flowers and a stream. They turned an old canal in to a lovely walking park.
23,5.0,"Nice to escape to this perfect place and stroll the full length at whatever pace takes your fancy. Take in the atmosphere, people watch or track your pace and do it as a workout. There is something for everyone and I loved it."
24,5.0,These days it is hard to imagine how this space was before the previous road was demolished. It was worthwhile overcoming the various objections raised to thwart this project that has now clearly much improved the urban environment
25,5.0,This is special - very relaxing to walk along this little stream that flows through the heart of Seoul
26,4.0,"A nice way to spend some time, walking along the stream.  Very quiet and relaxing - with the busy city above"
27,5.0,Such a pleasant way to spend an evening strolling along the river. There are murals and buskers along the way as well as a digital light show. Highly recommended for your visit to Seoul.
28,5.0,We talked the stream just after lunchtime on a sunny day in April.  It was lovely.  Exciting and relaxing at the same time.  Everyone - from families having a picnic to the ubiquitious office workers on their cell phones - was out enjoying this lovely location.  I see from the reviews that people who walked with stream in the winter were disappointed.  So the season may make a big difference in visiting this lovely site.
29,5.0,Each season is different decorations. Very relaxing here a good place for couples to walk together get some breeze alongside the canal.
30,2.0,We visited this in the day and it was just ok. At night time with the lights it would be a lot prettier a so I suggest you go then.
31,5.0,"The stream was clear and clean. There’s nothing much to do there apart from taking photos of the scenery and yourself, as well as taking a walk by the pavement beside it. Although there’s not much to do, it’s still a must visit in Seoul."
32,4.0,"it was a cold night, therefore i guessed there were not so many people along the stream. the stream and walking paths are very clean,there were exits along the stream, so that you can stop anytime and find the nearest subway station."
33,5.0,Saw this on TV how they demolished the elevated highway to revive the stream.It was a nice experience to see it up close. The colors after winter may not be that good but the crowd was fewer.
34,3.0,"Walked along this stream during our recent visit to Seoul. It was winter, so not much going on. It was just an interesting break to a busy city. We understand in spring/summer, there are lights and various activities along the stream, so definitely worth a look then."
35,3.0,"It's beneath the streets, beautiful and relaxing. If you want to avoid the busy roads and traffic, take this peaceful side walk."
36,5.0,We were there during winter. There were Christmas lightings and really beautiful. Good for jogging and brisk walks. It is very clean. Some part of the walls describe the history of this stream
37,2.0,"On Seoul official Instagram, I saw a gorgeous photo of the Cheonggyecheon Stream with beautiful lights decoration at night. So I decided to visit the stream. However, I couldn't find the beautiful lights decoration even though I walked for quite a distance. I searched for the lights at many parts of the stream - from Jongno to Dongdaemun. Couldn't find the lights so I gave up. Disappointed."
38,1.0,"it was advertised that the schedule for autumn lantern display was until november 18, my mom and i went there on our last night on november 10 bearing with the chilly night weather, not a single lantern in sight, we also bumped into a few foreigners who are wondering saying aloud ""where are the lanterns?"""
39,4.0,"There's a nicely paved sidewalk on both sides of the stream here. The stream is pretty cute and clean. You can cross over to the other bank by walking across stones that have been placed in the stream. There are some nice plants, small waterfalls, etc."
40,3.0,"The stream is decorated and lite for Christmas lantern around the week of Christmas.  The stream was strung with overhead lanterns and yule-time lighted figures was setup throughout a length of stream.  There was also some folk dancing and a setup where people could light lanterns and float them down the stream.  Of course, there was the usual food  booths.  Fairly busy with lots of local people attending."
41,5.0,What an enjoyable stroll we had with lights and decorations! Our walk was delightful and we were able to stop and take pictures along the stream.
42,5.0,We were so lucky to see the Lantern Festival!  This is a man made walkway with a stream of water that is under the traffic and is 5 miles long.  It is a well planned space for a busy city.
43,4.0,"Yes, I've been here before in 2009. Still, I'm amazed at how the people have kept this stream clean. Hats off to you! See attached pictures and notice the clear water and wildlife. There are CCTV cameras along the stream, too."
44,5.0,"We walked for about 1 mile along this stream, which features a narrow park-like setting on both sides, and found this space to provide a lovely respite from the city’s noise andhigh-rises. Part of a program to provide green areas in Seoul, the area opened in 2005 after the removal of an elevated highway and roads that hid what was left of a stream below. To keep it running now, water is pumped from elsewhere to maintain a steady flow. Cheonggye Plaza near Gwanghwamun Square in north-central Seoul marks the starting point, A tall modern sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggeu signals the plaza. Titled “Spring,” the work displays alternate red and blue spirals and resembles a thin Christmas tree.We descended steps that lead to a walkway, where the immediate view is a wide waterfall to the right, which plunges into the stream. No vegetation appears in this section, but greenery, including trees, soon comes into view. Footbridges and stepping stones sometimes gave access to the opposite side of the stream. Flowers arranged in boxes and pots on walls brightened the area. Nature kept our attention, and we hardly noticed the tall buildings in adjoining neighborhoods. Only a few people wandered here on this Saturday morning, and we much appreciated the serenity."
45,5.0,This is a great little walk and at the moment it’s hosting the lantern festival and a good place to grab a drink or some food and sit in The Sun
46,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is a quiet peaceful path along a small river in the center of Seoul.  As you are below street level car noise is much less.Crowded during the Seoul Lantern festival, but beautiful to see all the unique designs.I great way to walk away from traffic"
47,4.0,We visited at night as everything started to light up. if you're after a pleasant and peaceful stroll along the river it's nice.
48,5.0,"I love this stream. It’s very clean. Very serene, especially if you get to go there when it’s not busy with a lot of other tourists. Great place to relax and enjoy nature after walking to see palaces/museums/sights the whole day. Such a peaceful place to be especially in busy Seoul City."
49,4.0,"I saw this recommended in a travel guide and as it was not far from our hotel we spent an hour or so wandering along a section of the stream. What a pleasant surprise to discover this  in the middle of the commercial district, a real oasis of peace and calm surrounded by trees and occasional artwork.Sadly we didn’t have the chance to return in the evening but it must be lovely when all the lanterns are lit up."
50,5.0,"A great place to visit if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Seoul for a bit. I was able to relax and revive here. The path is well constructed and very pleasant to wander as much as you desire. The sound of the stream trickling past is relaxing. Some flowers adorn some of the side parts of the stream. Lit up at night, the stream has a different ambience again. Stepping stones along some parts of the stream create lots of fun for kids and adults alike to jump from one stone to another. The depth of the stream is not too deep, but keep a watch and hold your kid's hands to prevent an unwanted fall in the water. No cafes so bring your own water to drink.Many steps at various points to access the river, and occasional ramps provide good access. I loved it here!"
51,5.0,Really just an outdoor park space to hang with. Maybe eat or drink while you are there. Interesting from a revitalization perspective but it really is just a quick walk.
52,4.0,"Walked this a couple of times, and the bubbling waters provide a nice break from the surrounding city. Believe this used to be an actual road which has been converted. Plenty of fish in the water........but not one single duck to be seen."
53,5.0,"Our hotel was right next to the steam (New Kukje, stay there!), so we spent some time walking up and down to various places. Lovely place where many locals go to escape and relax. Beautiful at night."
54,5.0,Just amazing walking during nighttime when light ambiance are perfect. Calming to stroll alongside the stream and look at some of the light show displayed on the wall side.
55,4.0,This was a great location to get a small respite from the bustling city life.  It was clean and beautiful.  If you are looking for more than a walk along a stream you will be disappointed though.  There were nice cool places to sit and take a break and I even put my feet in the water (although I am not sure this is permitted).
56,4.0,"Great way to stroll the city without traffic.  Lighting at night makes you forget you are in a busy city.  We used the canal to get from one area to another.  Lots of people during the day enjoying lunch, too.  We even saw a heron chasing a fish!"
57,5.0,"Some years ago the city decided to tear up a road as there was a stream underneath it, and now it has been developed into a beautiful place to walk. There are fish in the stream, plants by the banks and a few sculptures. Walking along the paths, either side of the stream, a few meters below the surrounding area it is quite peaceful and many of the noises of the city cannot be heard. What a wonderful development."
58,5.0,"It  is well worth seeking out a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream, we were fortunate to be staying one block away from the stream and had time for two walks, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, both times it was wonderful to escape the busy Seoul streets.  The stream is well used by locals getting out and about for a little fresh air and exercise, it was relatively peaceful even though up above are roads.  Along the wall of the pathway are signs letting you know were you are in relation to the streets above, distances and some interesting art installations.  We also loved to see large fish in the stream, hopefully a good sign of water quality, as it looked clear."
59,5.0,"Seoul has more than its fair share of linear parks, but this one takes the cake in terms of being useful and beautiful.  There's stepping stones across the stream, there's sitting areas, there's painted ceramic tiles, waterfalls, trees and shade.  There's directional signage to the nearest metro stop at each exit stair from the Stream.  Not many garbage cans, not for bikes, more for walkers, no vending machines if you are thirsty.  Occasionally, there were swarms of gnats.  Water is so clean you can see variety of fishy inhabitants."
60,4.0,"Its a narrow sream yet relaxing and very silent. When i first put my feet in the stream ,i never thought many big fish live here,take some bread with you and try feeding fish and after a moment you will be surprised!"
61,5.0,The first time I have been here with my boyfriend. The place so beautiful and romantic. In here many many couples. I was happy there with my boyfriend. We were also eat something around ( street food) very delicious ☺️️
62,4.0,"Walked along a short stretch of the stream one evening. Interesting and lovely place, mostly for couples to stroll and spend time together below the city streets. The entire stream is quite long so we just had a short visit on the side nearer to Myeongdong."
63,3.0,The stream is a little green oases in the city which makes it pleasant to stroll along at night but unfortunately it also smells like sewer at certain places.
64,3.0,"I was here walking along the river years ago. At that time, it was very beautiful. At this time around, in year 2018, it was not well maintained. It does need refurbishment as there is still a potential."
65,5.0,"Clearly a popular hangout. It is a beautiful spot, especially right now with the lanterns. Looks amazing all lite up at night."
66,4.0,"Every now and then some events are organised here.We went here many times: new year celebration,  lantern festival etc."
67,4.0,It’s great that Seoul was able to clean up this stream.   Some fish up to about 2’ swimming as well as some other little ones.   Pretty green area below street level thru the city with stepping stones at intervals to cross from one side to the other.   We walked from near Jongmyo to the JW Marriott.
68,3.0,"Nice area to walk through. We went at sunset in the beginning of spring and it was pretty chilly when we went so we didn't stay for long.There are murals on the walls with plaques about the history of the area. There are also stepping stones across the stream, which is quite nice."
69,3.0,"It was a very nice park, a good backdrop to the surrounding urban area, very clean and filled with people. It's a good place to take a walk or sit and people watch but not really much else. Restaurants and shops line the edges so that helps too if you want to take a nice walk after dinner, but that's about it. Stop by if you're close or have the time in your itinerary."
70,3.0,"When reaching Seoul, we've been told this place is a must seen. All i can say, its a nice place, but over hyped. Recommend going there but without a lot of expectations."
71,4.0,"This canal has undergone refurbishing and beautifying works from what it once was to a place where people gather for a stroll and to just unwind. It's very clean and there is no foul smell. During festival seasons, this place will be decorated accordingly and will be much more impressive than on normal days."
72,4.0,"If you want to walk through the city, without having to cross roads and deal with traffic then this is a perfect place to walk along.The stream and plants make it very pretty.  It’s quiet in the morning but it’s a popular place for city workers to spend lunchtime, so gets much busier later in the day."
73,4.0,Beautifully done & environmentally friendly way of showcasing the stream that runs though Seoul CBD. Incorporated into everyday life an option for locals & tourists alike to take a break from the hustle & bustle to watch & listen to the sound of flowing water.
74,5.0,"When you have done a whole day of walking in the Dongdaemun area, this spot is idyllic for rest and people-watching. As with most of Seoul, this park is well-kept. There is ample room for people to sit and enjoy the scenery. We went here in different parts of the day and observed that it never gets too crowded."
75,3.0,Imagined this place would be somewhat more special. Just a rather boring canal/stream. Decent if you want to go for a walk before heading to insadong
76,5.0,"We really enjoyed the lovely river walk.  It was winter, so probably not as pretty as it must be in the summer, but the sound of running water was very relaxing.  Great lit up at night, and loved the mural of the royal processional with the music and sound of the horses."
77,4.0,"We had been there in December, was decorated by a lot of light. We passed by during day time and it is not beautiful as night time."
78,4.0,"We were lucky to visit when the Lantern Festival was on.  My impression of what the Lanterns would be was a little off track, but it was really interesting and a pleasant and safe place to explore.  It seems like they use it a lot showcase things such as the lantern festival, new year, art works etc."
79,4.0,"An unusual and invigorating walk along a beautifully planned and well executed stream through the heart of the old city, especially in February (11 degrees below zero!)."
80,4.0,"We walked a portion of this stream.  Since it was during the Christmas holidays, it was decorated with holiday lights and Santa Claus.  We went during the day.  It was pretty quiet and peaceful.  We enjoyed walking along this stream without having to worry about the car traffic."
81,4.0,"The river is very long, nice for walking and relaxing. Location is close with the road and can be visitted by many access along the river. The river can be enjoyed by visitor at all season, especially at night time while we can enjoying the light with full color here."
82,4.0,"Located only 5min by foot from DDP, this renovated stream provides a pleasant walk and a break from bustling Dongdaemun whether you're walking up river or down river (east or west). There were several crossing points along the river where one can traverse the rocks that come above the water surface. Clean, clear water with fishes and plants, shouldered by several outdoor art pieces, this place is also good for kids."
83,3.0,"Please observe that depending on what time of the year you go here it can be completly desolate. (just a walking path next to the stream in the city) You have to check out Seoul tourist website to see if there is an even going on here or not. Depending on the even it can be amazing or quite meh. The lantern festival is usually great, the kimchi festival did next to nothing for me. Sometimes they have some art installations which were very nice."
84,5.0,It only takes a little detour from Dangdaemun or Myeongdong to see this. A most pleasant spot. Go down and take a short stroll - a great break in the middle of the huge city
85,4.0,"This stream sits right in the middle of a busy business district with many tall commercial buildings & busy traffic. It is near Gwangjang market as well.However, because the stream is many feet down from road level, it is quite peaceful & is like a park. It is a long walk though & was pretty hot in the afternoon. The view  above from below is quite nice, with all the tall buildings jutting out.Colorful lantern-like characters decorate the different sectors of the stream. It will be much nicer at night when it is lighted up.This is a good place to relax with a nice unhurried stroll."
86,5.0,"Currently there is a lantern festival at the stream that makes it extremely beautiful. Even without it, it would be a very peaceful stroll but amazing time to go now to see the Winter Olympic decorations!"
87,2.0,"Although this was a great idea by the city of Seoul the area nearest Dongdaemuen market is not an attraction of any sort. The part of the stream that we saw had a lot of litter, people were constantly spitting everywhere, and the bridge we walked over looked like a parking lot for motorbikes. We went because we saw the beautiful ads for the streams so it was a big disappointment -- the city has made such a big effort but has not taken care of it."
88,5.0,We love this cosy & nice breezy stream. Can take a lot of nice pictures here. There is also a wishing pond which you can toss a coin and make a wish. Can even sit down to rest and relax to chit chat or enjoy a cup of coffee in your hand.
89,4.0,A contrast to the hustle & bustle of the city. You could be in the countryside. We wondered along here to get to a market. Well worth fitting into your days itinerary
90,5.0,"Maybe considered an odd choice for an attraction, a stream in the middle of the city, but that's exactly the point - a ribbon of fast flowing water where a decade ago there had been a highway. Stroll for a few meters or walk the full 10 kilometres for some relaxtion away from the hustle of 10  million people."
91,5.0,This area is a good place to walk around and people watch or grab a bite to eat. There are lots of people and shops
92,4.0,Its a good place to take pictures. Easy to find and walking distance from our hostel. Good place for a joggers too
93,5.0,First did the walk along the river during the day.  The river has Crystal clear water which is so rare to see in the middle of a city.The waters are full of fish and birds and plenty of greenery along the walk.During the night they have light shows and buskers along the walk. Lots of couples enjoying the Walk and just a stone throw away from night life.
94,5.0,"We walked along the river from the western edge over to Gwangjang Market and back again on a nice October afternoon. It's a lovely thing to do. It's a really relaxed place full of families and couples having a lovely chilled time. It's not stunning, but it's a lovely oasis in a hectic city."
95,4.0,The stream running through Seoul was restored in 2005 after a process that took about two years. It greatly enhances the aesthetic value of Seoul.
96,5.0,"If you're looking for a nice distraction from the bustling Seoul City, this is it. You can take a pleasant stroll below street level watching the stream flow sometimes peacefully and other times strong. Murals, historical plaques and other items line the length.If you're looking for exercise as well, then this also works but wear comfortable shoes. We walked about 5 miles and enjoyed it all. At night lights and additional fountains come on, unfortunately we didn't have chance to be there then. Best of all this is a free and enjoyable attraction."
97,5.0,U can walk above and below along this stream. Lots of little quirks to see along the way. Surrounded by coffee shops and restaurants. Well lit for early evening walks. We were there during the Arts Festival so there was heaps to see and do. Great for children.
98,5.0,"We ended up giving up on transportation and walked back to hotel or to the city alone that stream. So nice and relaxing, even when it's quite crowded it's still enjoyable. Thank you Seoul for cleaning up and opening this stream for people."
99,5.0,"The river has been covered earlier but reopened. Walkways on both sides of the stream, nice plantation. All just in the middle of Seoul."
100,4.0,"Nice little stream to walk next to in the middle of the city. it is long, clean and peaceful. The art on the walls with the explanations is also very nice. Little benches and rocks to stop and sit on. :)"
101,5.0,This is a beautiful walk at daytime or in the evening. It felt very safe. We would sit and listen to the street musicians or watch families.
102,4.0,The concept behind the stream is very investing... built where a failed bridge was. Path is very smooth with multiple was to access. We took the subway then walked rest of route on foot. You are able to see many bridges and can go down to stream front and even cross on skipping rocks.
103,3.0,The Cheonggyecheon Stream is actually 10.8km long and was transformed into an eco park after a  restoration project. We walked here from our place of stay near Jogno 3 station after dinner just before it got dark. There were pathways beside the stream and many people were walking or jogging using these paths.  The Seoul lantern festival is held here for two weeks in November but we were too early as we stayed in October. Quite a relaxing place for an after dinner walk when it is cool.
104,4.0,"If your in the area you can't miss this little gem, 30mins walking along it fun, and there are heaps of artworks to look.  It is fairly close to the centre and you can walk here from the centre."
105,4.0,"In the middle of town is this small stream, but about 6 kilometers long.Very relaxing.Many possibilities to sit down and relax."
106,5.0,"We found this and used it every day to cross the city and get to sights.  What a fantastic project to have a river walkway created right in the city.  It's peaceful too, very few people around.  Lots of insects though :-)  Great for a relaxing walk."
107,4.0,"This was less than a 1/2 mile from my hotel so I ran on it in the mornings I was there. Quiet, peaceful, no cars and not to many people out early walking."
108,4.0,"Went to korea fr the first time and we were lucky to have stayed nearby this river nearer to DDP. This place was walkable and even though its a looonngg stretch .. Make sure to note where you wanna go from the walk as you will be absorb by the walk and forget the correct exit to where you wanna go . I made a mistake by thinking it was a short river to enjoy that when i asked how to get to where im going, i was advice its 2 subway stops away and about a short walk.. Hahaha, Hubby and i are not athletic nor the fit type .. But we were continuously walking and only reach our location about 45-55minutes later .. But the walked there was beautiful with the cooling stream and fishes to distract  us from the early summer heat. We particularly love crossing the river on the blocks of rocks thats place strategically to cross the river...However, if your lucky or have thought ahead.. it seems there are always something going on at the river head near dongdaemun on the weekends.. When were there , they had fashion show for the oldy mouldy's and young at heart adults and even a musical talent show.  Either way check the place out... =)PS: this is very close to the famous "" Grilled Fish Street in Dongdaemun Market"" . A must visit i must say ...!!=)"
109,5.0,"Beautiful place if you look for some place for either romantic, but calm date or just want to walk alone.Little piece of calmness in fast and never sleeping Seoul~~"
110,4.0,"We ended a tiring shopping day with a walk along this stream right in the middle of the city. The people coming down to see the water were delighted to take their shoes off and sit on the steps that line the bank, dangling their feet in the cool water. There were couples there with little picnics, a high school tour group, a grandfather with his elementary aged granddaughter, senior citizens on an evening walk, and European tourists that walked by, crossed the stepping stones or put their feet in the water during the hour we were there. As it got darker, lights under the bridge came on and we realized it was all orange . I think the other bridges were different colors. Just north of this (1 block) is a temple and a whole lot of restaurants! Good food too!"
111,4.0,"We walked down to the stream and walked along a couple of kilometres of it. It's a very picturesque little stream with many stone crossings and platforms for sitting on and contemplating ! The history behind it is very interesting as well, particularly about the historic bridge and the history behind the stones used in its construction . Little man made oasis in the middle of Seoul!"
112,5.0,"This stream is one of my favorites in Seoul.  I have been there many times and photograph it a lot.  If you like to photograph the fish in the stream, the birds, the flowers, the bridges, the combination of a stream and the city, the people, the entertainers and waterfalls you will be happy there.And on both sides of the stream are markets, old and new.  I recommend going down the stream to Dongdaemun.  There is a building there that is one of a kind and a remarkable design.  Take your widest lens with you.  And this stream and Dongdaemun is not only for daytime walk, but not less interesting at dusk and night when the lights turn on.  How Seoul lights up at dusk is experience I have not had elsewhere."
113,4.0,"After a visit to Gwangjang Market, we decided to take an evening stroll along the stream. It was a Friday night and quite a few people were out and about. At one point, there was a duo performing on one side of the stream with their audience seated in tiered seating on the other side of the stream."
114,4.0,We spent a nice hour an half following the stream. Incredibly clean and well maintained saw some interesting birds and wild life.  A very tranquil way to spend and hour or two in a big city
115,5.0,We stumbled upon Cheonggyecheon stream the first time while walking through Dongdaemun market district. Unfortunately there wasn't much going on at the time in terms of festivities. But it was a great decision to reopen this to the public as it can only be associated to Seoul. Would love to visit during traditional festive period.
116,5.0,The Cheonggyecheon Steam is a great way to make one's way through part of downtown Seoul. Recommend starting by taking the metro to Jonggak on the blue line and going east along the stream from there to the city wall near DDP. Relatively shady in places.
117,5.0,"Start at the beginning of the waterfall in the evening.Great fun, beautiful under water lighting, romantic, enjoyable, nice highlight of trip to Seoul."
118,3.0,A stream through the the heart of this metropolis makes a great stroll and the walkways make it very easy and accessible for all. There are a few things to look at along the way. The stretch we strolled did not have much and mainly cut down shrub and grass.Perhaps other parts are better or another time of year?Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
119,5.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream represents the city's river of life in more ways than one. This 10km stream not only revitalize the city centre with its innovative design, but provides the perfect relaxation to the people in the city, be it the stressed out office workers, hyperactive school kids, fitness-driven joggers, restless elderly folks or the weary tourists. I would recommend dipping your feet into the clear running water at the Gwanghwamun end of the stream (during the summer!). An almost heavenly feeling!"
120,5.0,"We went at the sunset so we can see the stream at the day but also at night. It's a very nice place to just walk along the stream, and eat there. There was a street food market when we went there which was really cool but unsure if its all the time like that."
121,5.0,"This stream area runs for miles through downtown Seoul. It is a lovely, green area to stroll, sit, people watch, sketch, chat with a friend. It is also a great place to run as you are below streetlevel and out of reach of car exhaust! Just watch out for gnats and mosquitos in summer!"
122,4.0,This was a very enjoyable walk through the city. Used it twice going to and from our hotel. It was very pretty with birds and murals. Signs explaining history in English.
123,5.0,Went to this location in a warm afternoon and this place is just off the subway. Take the stairs down to the stream and park yourself close to the water fountain. That starts at random and the mist can be pretty cooling. It's also a nice walk along the stream if you can be there before noon as the afternoon sun can be a bit hard in you.
124,4.0,"After lunch at Migabon, we started to head towards this stream and was in for a pleasant surprise we found it right in the middle of city scrappers. The sound of the water cool you down during hot weather and we even chanced upon a local produce market. Nice walk."
125,3.0,"A nice little walking canal.  On the day we were there, a group of high school students was cleaning the canals.  Very clean place."
126,5.0,"This stream is fantastic, do look up on some brief history of the stream because Seoul actually demolished a highway to reveal this gem. We saw all kinds of fish along the stream including catfish! Spend a good amount of time here to truly appreciate the wildlife. The locals will be right there along with you admiring the streams beauty."
127,4.0,nature set up right in the middle of the city. great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul without leaving the city. there is always something going on in and around the stream as well. very beautiful at night.
128,5.0,"We walked the entire stream from the city end until where the museum is. I think the entire stretch will take 2 hour stroll. Walking towards the city was more 'scenic', though not natural, as there were more things to see and better maintained. Walking to the museum we passed Dongdaemun area and see the remains of the highway that once covered the stream."
129,5.0,"This walk can be made from and to many place. It is actually a walk on the river edge of Seoul. We did it from dongmyo to dongmaeum in the morning. Not many people, you can do it from one metro station to another or go on until the next. You can cross at anytime there are many rock bridge.To do for a romatic walk or for a run the morning"
130,5.0,This is a great example of how transform a city.This canal is situated in the city center and it brings peace and calm in the middle of the frenetic Seoul life.
131,4.0,"Strolling up and down the Cheonggyecheon Stream and the Cheonggye Plaza is a very relaxing thing to do.The whole area has a very calm, slow and relaxed feeling about it. When you take the few steps down to the stream you feel like you left Seoul. The water flows slowly down, past a lot of art to enjoy.People just sit around and enjoy the calm and quiet atmosphere here. There are a few tourists, but it's mostly locals or national tourists that flock here. Which I think is nice.There's a good numbers of restaurants, especially around the Cheonggye Plaza with the eye-catching Spring Sculpture. A really great thing to do. Seoul is quite walking-friendly. After this you could easily walk to the Palace and then to Insadong (which we did).Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
132,5.0,"I went there accidentially, it's easy to find, left the Admiral Yi Sun Shin behind and walk down to street then turn left at the second street. Its locates between line1(dark blue) and line2(green) You can go to Gwangjang Traditional Market where its likes a center of Korean traditional food. You would face to flying insects groups when you visit there so late afternoon!"
133,5.0,"this is one of the most visit spot in the heart centre of Seoul. near Gwanghwamun palace, Insadong, Myeungdong, so you could easily access on foot of those spots. walking along the stream brings us a fresh and peaceful moment. really enjoy walking here."
134,3.0,"They had a water parade when we arrived which was nice. However, it made it Super busy and difficult to walk alongside the stream. There's not really a lot to take in and it doesn't really take you anywhere."
135,5.0,A lovely stream six kilometers in the middle of yhe city that makes it a most impressive project built by the city for the people of the city. A must.
136,5.0,"Real urbanistic victory! It is a real stream located in the downtown of Seoul and full of different nice spots to relax and enjoy the peaceful atmospere in the middle of busy city. Big fishes inside, herons walking in bushes, unbelievable! Surely worth a visit!, strongly recommended"
137,4.0,It's a peaceful place if you just want to take a walk or sit around. Calming effect just by watching the stream flows.
138,4.0,Excellent planning to create a cool and interesting place to walk.  We had just missed Buddha's birthday so as well as coloured lanterns there were lots of other interesting statues and objects created on small islands in the stream.
139,5.0,Amazing how many people gather at The Stream both day and night. Great to see so many families and young people getting together for a picnic or to talk.We walked a couple miles along the sidewalk and it was much cooler that at the street level.The statues at the beginning of The Stream light up at night and are interesting to look at.
140,5.0,"Walking area along a stream. Great at night with the lights, etc. Multiple places to get in and out. It's free."
141,5.0,What was once covered over by a street has been reclaimed as a beautiful park and steam in the heart of Seoul.   Well worth the visit if you are in the neighborhood.
142,4.0,When my visit there is deakobbi festival... along the stream there is food truck selling various food from various countries.... other are selling souvenirs and hand craft... we are lucky we can experience such fastive season along the stream...
143,4.0,"We walked it during the day for about an hour and a half. It's very popular with locals taking a break or eating lunch. Plenty of fish to observe in the stream, some good street art and other informative pieces"
144,4.0,"Take a romantic stroll hand in hand with your loved one along the banks of the stream  and enjoy their company amidst the cool night air, the gentle sounds of a babbling brook, beautiful night lights, interesting wall motifs/decorations and even a spot to make a wish. There is even live entertainment provided by bands or solo performances to set the mood and delight your ears.The beginning of the Cheonggyecheon stream houses a man made waterfall and not to far off from there, lies a spot for visitors to make wishes by tossing a coin in the stream.There is an interesting mosaic of a Historic Royal Procession documenting the visit by the royal king and his entourage. It stretches on for quite a bit and the plaques describe the different members of the entourage displayed.Test your eyes out and try to find the king.If plan to walk all the way to the end, please take note that the stream stretches on for a long distance,. However, there are many places for you to sit and rest along the way.Overall a nice romantic and relaxing place to visit especially recommended for couples."
145,4.0,We struck out in lunch hour and it was busy but such a calm from the hustle and bustle above. Take a pick nick and find a spot to enjoy.
146,5.0,Chanced upon the stream walking from our place in Myeongdong to Samcheongdong-gil road. Its very clean with pathways I could only imagine would be great for jogging at any time of the day.We passed it again coming back to our hotel and decided to stay and walk down as far as our already tired legs could. It was very calming and a nice place to just sit and relax in conversation or be alone.Shame we did not get to see it at night though.
147,4.0,This is a nice place to at least stop for a few minutes and enjoy. A peaceful place to walk in the Centre  of a bustling metropolis.
148,3.0,Cheonggyecheon is man made stream. You can enjoy a nice walk durning the night and see some colorful lights under the bridge. It's a great place to visit but there isn't much to due there except to walk or watch the water flow down the stream.
149,5.0,This was a pretty little walk on a spring morning. I only wish we had arrived a few weeks later when the trees and flowers are in bloom. I would also leave time to walk the entire length. A nice option to walking at street level.
150,5.0,"It's a nice long stroll that passes by many areas. I stayed in Hotel Nafore which is near jongno3 and often walked back using this stream. It is man made with some interesting lighting features and some parts with lots of plants growing to make it look like nature. I went at the beginning of spring where many plants haven't started blossoming but I can imagine if you went at the peak of spring or autumn, it should be quite beautiful. Walk at night and it is quite romantic."
151,5.0,"Great for a tranquil long walk along a waterway in the middle of the city. There are often festivals along this waterway. When I was last here in November, they had a lantern festival here which was awesome."
152,4.0,"Love to take a walk here, had a very long walk with wife and both of us enjoy the peaceful water flowing atmosphere, plus the coolness temperature (April)."
153,4.0,Pleasant to walk through the city on these pathways even in deep winter. Well maintained and interesting walk with regular opps to go go back up to street level. Busy in evenings so it felt safe. Suitable for strollers but toddlers will need closer supervision.
154,5.0,"Built under the ground level in the heart of Seoul, the Cheonggyecheong Stream is a beautiful man-made 10km pathway running from west to east of Seoul. Took an late night walk here after exploring City Hall, this place is a romantic getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city where couples can sit by the stream, chatting, eating some snacks or take an endless walk till you stop.Coupled with lights and some historic decorations on the wall, it is an interesting experience and something I'll gladly do over and again when I'm back in Seoul.Very accessible with many metro stations along the stretch, so you can alight at any of them and reach this stream very conveniently if you happen to be near it."
155,4.0,"The stream is a pleasant way to walk from one place to another in Seoul away from traffic and crowd. It offers good photo opportunities throughout its entire stretch. I usually like to go for s troll along the stream after having a meal at Gwangjang market. It can get pretty cold in winter right beside a huge body of water, so bundle up if you need to!"
156,5.0,This is a perfect way to get a quick escape from the noise and crowd in Seoul. Looking at the flowing clear water with the ducks and fishes just relaxed my mind. It is amazing to know that this place was once very dirty.
157,5.0,"I was surprised to see this calming stream of water gushing through the step rocks in the middle of the road in Seoul.  The sound of gushing water sends shiver to my spine and it felt so relaxing.  After a busy shopping day, we dropped by here again just to relax and take pictures."
158,4.0,"The stream makes for a lovely stroll in the evening, when it isn't so hot. The area is clean with plenty of spots to sit and people watch and take pictures. While it is situated in the middle of busy streets, that it is ""one storey"" below means you are still able to escape from the city buzz. There are also a few spots where you can hop onto the rocks from one bank to the other."
159,4.0,"Nice place to have a walk (evening is better). It's kind of calming. At the start it's much nicer, with lights and different stone arrangements.. further on it's still ""raw""... And it's longer than you expect."
160,5.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a good place to go within the concrete jungle to somewhat get away from the bustle of the city.  It is a soothing, relaxing place to take a slow stroll making us realize how beautiful nature is."
161,5.0,"This was one of my favorite stops in Seoul because you not only get to have a nice, relaxing walk next to a beautiful stream but also people watch some locals enjoying it as well. It cuts through the bustling city of Seoul in such a beautiful way and if you walk to where the water fountains with lights at night, it's even more beautiful! You can sit on rock along the stream, benches by the fountain, or anywhere really. Dip your feet in too if you'd like! It's very long and right by practically everything! Must must must do!"
162,5.0,It is pretty amazing to see that Cheonggyecheon Stream is in the middle of the city.It was crowded at the beginning of the stream but walking further down led to more space. It's a nice place to take a break from a long day of tourist exploring. It's a little artsy with some nice murals along the stream. While there may not be something to do here If you plan on visiting bring a snack and relax along the river as I saw many people do.
163,5.0,"it was snowing as we got to see it and even then you can imagine how lovely it would be on a warm day when you could just sit there and listen to rushing water. It used to be a mostly covered and neglected water way that was uncovered and re-opened in 2005. this offers a lovely walk of about 11km's. The stream, 22 bridges span it, runs into the Hangang river."
164,5.0,"To call Cheonggyecheon Stream a stream is like calling Martin Luther King a minister or calling David Bowie a singer, it has such an influence and long lasting effects on the economic, social and environmental terms it should really be one of the world's wonder.Lovely place to restore serenity to the system and have a romantic stroll with your loved ones.  Valentines day coming up, bring a bunch of roses!Up there with the Eiffel Tower and Central Park!"
165,5.0,"Walking distance from Gyeongbokgung Palace, City Hall, Myeongdong and Changdeokgung Palace. Can easily reached by taking the metro and stop at City Hall station, Gwanghamun Station or Anguk Station. Prefer to visit in late evening as the scenery will be more outstanding. You can take a 10minutes walk to Myeongdong later for shopping and great street food."
166,5.0,"This stream was developed as a scenic and pleasant walkway through central Seoul a few years ago.  The water is fresh, and since the stream and walkway is lower than the city streets, it removes you from the noise and congestion at street level.  One can spend a couple of hours hiking this easy and pleasant walkway along a delightful stream."
167,5.0,"A very clean and relaxing view of the mainstream right in the heart of the city. Everyone will enjoy a calm breeze specially during autumn and spring season, perfect for long walk and you will discover many great food stalls and shops along the way."
168,5.0,Walking on the stream and seeing locals exercising and strolling was one memorable thing I did in Seoul.
169,4.0,"We walked into this by accident. We did plan to go but we were just walking though and saw it. Its a nice little stream which you can get away from the street hustle and walk by the stream, which is a bit more peacful."
170,4.0,"Smack dab in the middle of bustling downtown Seoul is a stream below street grade where people walk, run, relax and just ""be.""   It is well landscaped, well maintained and seemed very safe (at least during the day).  The weather was not great so the walk was shortened but suspect you can go many miles on one side, and turn around and return on the other.  Crossovers are frequent enough to make reversing not a problem.  A gem in the city."
171,4.0,"One can't underrate the magnificence of this Stream, of how one emboldened Mayor decided to transform a wasteland into such a majestic piece of work.  In winter time, particularly during Christmas time, there's LED and lighting presentations, and it does transform the stream into a winter wonderland.  In normal time, it's a wonderful place to reflect and to simply watch the world goes by whilst listening to the drones of the waterfall.  After many visits to Seoul, this, to date, is still one of my favourite spots in Seoul.  It simply is."
172,3.0,It is a nice place to chill and koreans use it to have a break from the busy city. Nice walk along the stream.
173,4.0,"The stream is nice but honestly a bit 'meh' during the day. Just a stretch of water. Granted this is in winter and the trees were mostly dead and no snow to make it more exciting.However, we gave it another crack Boxing Day and stumbled across the Seoul Christmas Festival. Now this was worth seeing. Amazing lights and decorations reflecting on the water gave the place an amazing atmosphere. Combined with music, vendors and couples everywhere, it was excellent."
174,3.0,"Running through the middle of the city, this stream is worth a look, but not worth going out of the way for. It's nice enough but nothing spectacular. That being said, I'm sure it's a much more worthwhile stop in the summer when it can provide some refreshment from the heat. But it winter it's definitely optional."
175,5.0,"A delightful stop on a hot muggy day in downtown Seoul. This interesting attraction which was as part of a Restoration effort by Seoul City. The once hidden Stream is now resplendent, clean, well lit in the evening times, and accessible by several Subway Stops...a great local for a sultry summer evening...with romance in the air."
176,4.0,If you feel you want to change your mode just go there after sunset walk for sometime then try to put your feet in the stream and you will not regret it.
177,5.0,"Make sure you walk along the stream, it is very peaceful and gets you where you want to go without all the hassle and bustle of the traffic."
178,5.0,"The rebirth of this once almost-dead stream is a source of Korean pride! Not only does it infuse nature in the middle of the city, but city dwellers use it for rest and recreation."
179,5.0,"Read about this stream online and decided to see it ourselves as part of our Seoul itinerary during our summer trip in August. The stream was indeed crowded with locals relaxing by the stream, kids playing with water while parents are having a small picnic. Even though it was in the summer, it is still pretty windy walking along this 11km long stream.  While walking along this stream, we also discovered Avenue of Youth, near Jonggak Station, a dining area with mostly youthful locals and good food.Overall, a good place to chill and enjoy soaking your feet in the freezing stream water. When in Seoul, follow the koreans."
180,5.0,This is a wonderful amenity in the centre of Seoul which creattes a leuisurely riverside walk or enrgetic run free of trafic and noise other than a babbling brook
181,4.0,"Can't imagine a highway being demolished and a filthy river being cleaned for a nature walking route. I was a bit sceptical and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. With the Cheonggyecheon Stream, I was totally converted to believe that the ugly can be turned beautiful if there is a will.  The walk was pleasant, the water in the stream was clean, there were fishes in the water and birds in the air. Truly an amazing work."
182,4.0,The stream was clean and calm and I found it a joy to walk down deep in my own thoughts. Great for some photo taking as well.
183,5.0,"This creative place, a combination of nature and architecture, is perfect for a nice stroll. Consider it as a part of your visit to Seoul."
184,3.0,"A nice walk after eating at the nearby Gwangjang market. It is a perfect place to work off the calories along the stream. Now do not expect anything raging, it is a slow running stream with fishes and ducks. So quite scenic. Only drawback, there are lots of tourists... We did not come in the evening when the stream is lighted up but it is highly recommended."
185,3.0,"The lighted lanterns are well worth seeing, but I had the impression that they were going to be spectacular, and I did not find them so. The setting is attractive. There are a lot of large lighted lanterns that are more like parade floats placed in this attractive stream in the middle of the city."
186,5.0,"Following many employees during their lunch break, we went down the staircase to see this green area inside the city with a small river flowing in the middle of it. There are many plants, a few bridges made of stones sticking out of the water, long murals depicting an historic procession and a small waterfall. We really enjoyed this relaxing walk."
187,4.0,"Perfect place for a date. Relax enjoy some food, check out this beautiful stream in Seoul. Take the subway to Jongno 5 ga or walk down from the DDP. When I was there they were filming a commercial so that was cool."
188,5.0,It's beautiful area in Seoul to spend your time in many good coffee shop. I suggest you guys to go to Jongkak station exit no.5. Then you can walk along the road. When you see the big building on your left hand side. You will see korea tourism organisation next to citibank building (im not sure but around there). You can go inside that buulding to wear free hanbok at 5fl. From the down stair you will meet sungjungki who is popular korean actor. Hope u guys enjoy.
189,4.0,"Special experience at Korea, lantern festival at this area during my last visit to Korea. Please beware if you are going with kids as the lantern is along the drain."
190,4.0,"We passed by this stream multiple times during the day which looks like just another canal. However, at night it was totally transformed due to the Seoul Lights Festival happening in November each year. Most of the lightings features Korea organizations or companies, and historical stories, and a few from other countries."
191,4.0,"It's nice to walk around in the evening. You can walk to Myungdong to city hall, insadong to Jongro. We highly recommend coming here. It's quite nice to relax and also to take a look at the events and art displays they have there."
192,5.0,who would have thought the stream at night looked so charming and romantic with dim lighting setting and the sound of the stream flowing...definitely a must go to get away from the busy city.
193,5.0,One of the best ideas I saw in a big city such as Seoul. It keeps the  nature in the busy city very effective. Worth to see it!
194,5.0,This is a must-see in Seoul. We were lucky to be staying relatively close so we went almost every evening. A lovely place to walk and people-watch. On our last night the Lantern festival had just started so we were lucky to see that. Definitely recommended.
195,5.0,"We went during the Lantern Festival which seems like a very popular time for locals and tourists to visit. The lanterns were absolutely beautiful and it was such a pleasant stroll along the stream. It was a weekday evening and already quite crowded, we had to wait for our turn to take pictures in front of the lanterns. I visited two years ago in the winter during the day, which felt extremely different. It was freezing cold with not much to see at all. But it was still a very serene walk so definitely check it out during the day if you are looking for a quiet walk in the core of the city."
196,4.0,2016 Lantern festival was showing this week so we spent 90 mins walking along the stream enjoying the shows. it;'s a nice walk without the lanterns and very popular with locals who sit and chat along the stream
197,5.0,"Apparently, this was underground untiil recent times. Now, it flows in a concrete walled canyon, about one story below street level...so it is nice and quiet when you walk down there. Lovely...for the middle of a huge city."
198,5.0,"This reclaimed stream goes through a central part of Seoul.  The entire area was very clean, including the water and stream bed, the walks on both sides, and the benches.  I found the section starting at Dongdaemun and heading West to be much more appealing than the section heading East from there.  I also found the path on the North side much nicer than that on the South side.  Many parts of the southern path are uneven and, though the walking is not difficult or dangerous, it just requires more attention.  That is important because there is some wonderful art along the path with the best being on the North walls.  Although there are lights at night, they were not very bright and there were not many people."
199,5.0,This could be the most impressive civil improvement in the world. Gorgeous art. Natural settings in the heart of an urban area.
200,5.0,"Truly a respite area for Seoul! Quickly removes one from the hectic pace of city life and the overwhelming amount of shopping that goes on. A peaceful, relaxing, quiet getway running through the city. A brilliant idea whomever conceived it and a very positive attraction for the city."
201,4.0,Gorgeous place in the middle of scyscrapper area. Great expecially by the night with all those lights.
202,5.0,"It is also the shortest way to walk from city hall to Insadong or Dongdenmun.If you have kids, you do not worry of the moving vehicles 🚗 and waste time waiting to cross at the traffic lights.  Kids can run 😜...wild..that's kids enjoyment and adults to wish for.   We can enjoy all the beauty below the bridges, arts, paintings, recycle works...etc.  The sound of the water is therapeutics and soothing.  I would prefer to walk from city hall to  dongdenmun instead of taking the subway a web of underground endless walk.  Putting your aching legs to the water is soothing"
203,5.0,"This is a very lovely and peaceful place to enjoy with friends, family or that special someone. During the day many families come here and enjoy putting their feet in the water and hopping around on the many stones in the stream. At night you'll see several couples taking a walk or sitting under a bridge and enjoying the beautiful atmosphere. If you're in Seoul in May you should absolutely check this stream out and enjoy the thousands of lanterns put out for the Lotus Lantern Festival and Buddha's Birthday!"
204,4.0,It a very nice place for relaxing where you can see the well designed river tracking with lightning at night. Also by walking on the Cheonggyecheon you are going to cross the Seoul city from west to East.
205,2.0,"It's really just a steam in the middle of the city.  I wouldn't go out of my way to just go see it. If your shopping in the area of Dondaemun shopping, you'll most likely walk by it on your way back to the subway. Only suggest to walk by it if you are in the area for a little rest break or to take a picture. We only stayed there for a few minutes."
206,5.0,"Such a lovely place to hangout. It's very romantic, a lot of couples have their dates there, sometimes there are artists singing and it's simply beautiful especially during the evening. You can have some snacks and drinks or just take a walk along the stream."
207,5.0,"I've discovered spots around Seoul all week where one can briefly escape the busyness of the city. This is one of them!  Just a few steps below street level, you'll find a greenway of flowing water and random artwork.  You obviously still hear some city noise but it's definitely less if you were walking on the sidewalk.  I didn't see any benches on the portion I walked, but I did see people sitting on rocks by the water.  I definitely recommend this!"
208,4.0,Walking the stream up to the palace was a nice walk.  You get a sense of a bit of history of Korea.  There is a statue dedicated to an admiral that fought the Japanese and one of the Kings of Korea as well. A very pleasant stroll.
209,4.0,"This is a long stream, good walk way, it is close by Dongdaemum, the stream is very pretty at night when the light are on... take a walk, its nice."
210,5.0,"It is refreshing, in the middle of all the traffic and high rises to have this stream to walk by.Impressive how the government decided to retrieve a piece of Seoul,s past.I recommend to visit evening and day time but If you do not have much time go in the evening. The lighting is wonderful."
211,4.0,"If you like to walk, this would be a perfect thing for you to do in Seoul.We walked from in front Marriott in Dongdaemun toward the end near Gwanghamun Gate. While it was quite far, the walk was nice and relaxing with plenty of spot to have a nice rest on the river.Is it a ""must see""? Well not for the typical tourist who just want to see a flashy attraction, considering this is just a chill walkway along the river. It was more of a nice activity if you're the kind of tourist who like to explore through a nice walk."
212,2.0,"I set this as one of the places to see unaware of how it operates.Its more like a chill out spot in the city and not exactly an ""attraction"" that you must see.The access to the stream was closed when I got there at night. I went there at night thinking it would look nicer when lit at night. The entire stream is not lit during the night. Only the origin point which is at cheonggyecheon plaza is lit at night. The rest of the stream are basically a stream with a bunch a trees.Its too bad I went there after going to gwangjang market and had to walk about half an hour all the way up the stream to the point it was lit.Do feel free to give this a miss. Not exactly a must see attraction. After a few minutes of photo taking and u wonder what're you doing there.Its in walking distance to Gwanghwamun gate. So feel free to drop by if you're near.Bring your own coffee or chocolate drink from 7E or CU  to chill there."
213,5.0,"A great place for walking, or just sitting and having a chat. Very child/family friendly. Very nicely ""reconstructed""."
214,4.0,"nice stroll of a warm evening, see the locals cooling their feet in the very clear waters of the stream walk as far or as short as you like"
215,4.0,"We walked past this stream on many occasions.  Lots of people come here to relax - have a stroll, couples spending time here and on a Saturday morning the families would bring a picnic mat and the children would be playing or colouring.  In the evening the stream is lit up and looks pretty."
216,4.0,"If you are ready, you can walk for 10km through this ecological Stream. Nicer during the night but also more crowded."
217,5.0,The place is nice for walking. Clean and refreshing. Bring the bird's food if you want to play with the birds :) :) :). Nice for family walk and children.
218,4.0,This is a beautiful stream which reminds me of Punggol waterway park in Singapore. We visited here in the day but i guess this place will look even more pretty at night when the lights are on. It can be romantic in the night as well.
219,5.0,"This a lovely place to walk along, below the level of the road, in the center of the city, which was easily accessible on foot from our hotel. What a great idea to create such a place. Somewhere to go to be quiet, or a nice way to walk across part of the city instead of walking by the roads."
220,4.0,This is such a small stream but the setting and design are extraordinary.  It is easy to see why this is so popular.  Don't miss it.
221,5.0,Nice place. Underneath the bridge locals sit to sing and talk. The river as well looks beautiful. Good place for a date with someone.
222,5.0,We walked from the start of the stream to Dongdaemun.  As soon as you get down to the stream you feel separated from the city.  It turns into a very nice and relaxing stroll.  We planned to walk from the start to the next subway station and then subway to Dongdaemun.  But ended up walking all the way to Dongdaemun because it was so nice.  Took maybe 45 minutes due to stopping along the way for photos.
223,4.0,It is so rare that there is such comfortable & relaxing walking area found in Seoul downtown.  It is original a underground stream and now become a public waling area for the public.  I like its night view. It is a very good place for lovers and family.  I think a MUST visit in Seoul.  You can't find similar place in Asia.
224,4.0,Just go here and take your foot to the stream and relaxing. Love this place. So many locals here. Must go
225,5.0,Walking in the depth of the stream would have you forgetting that you are in the city since the high walls block off the high rise buildings. Nice to see people just enjoying the nature and a safe place for the kids to just enjoy playing especially on a hot day.
226,4.0,A lovely place to walk during the day. It stretches quite far so you have to remember that you have to walk back or get the subway. There are bridges along the way to cross sides and art works as well. Many people were at the start of the stream at night sitting by the water which is lit up with lights.
227,3.0,"If you are bored and have no where else to go might be a good idea. Dont prioritize it to other attractions, good for a walk at night"
228,5.0,Very clean and beautiful stream in the middle of hot and crowded city. It's nice during the day to cool off and nighttime to relax.
229,5.0,"The city recently renovated this area after years of negligence and pleading. There are interesting sights and creative artwork along the path.  Obviously, it is much more pleasant during the Spring and early summer months before the heat wave roles in."
230,5.0,"This cool, fresh, green and clean stream crossing the city west to east, from Sejong-daero to Dongdaemun and beyond is a triumph of urban renewal. People freshen their feet in the stream below the bridges, large fishes swim upstream, herons wait for their lunch, grandmothers lead grandchildren in the mild thrill of stone hopping and river crossing, small groups assemble for picnic, piped classical music accompany you in the segments where nothing else happens and horse hooves on the pavement can be heard as you follow a long ceramic picture of a colorful royal procession. The whole experience is amazing. Over three days, we did follow part of it three times"
231,5.0,"Walk the main streets between Myeong-dong / City Hall and Insadong, to take in the vibe of the city and stunning high rise and history of the place. Then walk back along the stream and take time to ease warm tired feet in the cool relaxing stream... Perfection! Or just walk to the stream with your lunch or to relax for a while and cool your feet in the balmy Seoul summer heat!It's charming and an oasis amidst high rise offices. With various pass points where you can cross the stream without having to head up to a formal bridge, be sure to wear flip flops so you don't have to worry about wet feet! It would be amazing to have this by my office in the West End of London!!!"
232,5.0,"We had been shopping in the Dongdaemun area one evening and we decided to check-out this newly-built urban waterstream feature. It is lovely even at night. We visited late at night and there were plenty of people there, some wading in the water. It seemed popular with locals and tourists alike. This area is easily accessible by subway."
233,3.0,"Locals are here to catch the cool next to the water, even u can see fish in there. right next to the gwangjamg Market, if u just feed full u shld come here have a walk and then challenge the next shopping area."
234,5.0,"Great place to go for a stroll and enjoy nature in the heart of Seoul day or night. Very clean and serene.  If you visit during monsoon season, be careful, because the entire canal fills up very rapidly.If you benefited from this rating, please click the helpful button."
235,4.0,"If you have the time, take a leisurely stroll along the stream or dip your feet in it, watching the locals do what they do. It can be very calming amidst the hustle and bustle of the metropolis. During festivals, lanterns and other decorations are put up along the stream, making it more colourful than usual. At night, it is also lighted up. The length of the stream makes it quite accessible from most of central Seoul, so do set some time to check it out if you're in the vicinity."
236,5.0,It's where the nature meets human structures to create harmonious atmosphere between the two forces. It's where the nature thrives right in the heart of a busy city and people come to get a piece of calm mind. I went there both during the day and night but the vibe you get at night time is just magical with the soft vibrant lights luminating the river. It is one of the most romantic places to go in Korea.
237,5.0,"Had a walk down here between the DDP and Gwangjang Market. Beautiful little stream to walk down and to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city, even if the stream is ironically right in the middle of the city.Perfect place for an evening walk or a morning run!"
238,5.0,"at first you will find it strange to see a stream in the heart of the city. but when you walk beside it, you will feel very  comfort and the wind blow through the stream at night. It was also quite with some environment light. There are some local law that not allow people to drink beer in this area. so if you would want to buy some drink and find a good spot on the side just like what i have done, you would better to bring a bag with you, so that you can hide the drink inside. Many couples siting on the side watching the water flow. and at the end of the stream, there is some kind of lighting show with many different colore. I would strong recommend this activity after your dinner. Be sure to bring a jacket with you too as sometime the wind blow stronger along the way. I am lucky that I meet my local friends  from an app call TravoAsia. my local friend Yon Pak told me all the stuff about the attraction and was kind enough to buy me some local beer. Thanks Yon. and when you come to Hong Kong, i will treat you a local meal."
239,5.0,"This is one of the surprise in Seoul.  An urban stream making good use of space and resource.  It's very pleasant strolling down the stream in the evening with the sound of water, the colourful light and the crane meandering along the stream.  During the weekend, there's dancing and music performances.  Not to be missed!"
240,4.0,Cheonggyecheon is an 8.4 km creek flowing west to east through downtown Seoul  and eventually emptying in to the Yellow Sea. The stream was opened to the public in September 2005. There is a walking path along both sides of the stream and it is quite enjoyable to stroll along the stream.  This is a great place to people watch and take photos.
241,4.0,"Commencing near the Seoul City Hall Cheonggyecheon Stream winds its way for approximately 8 kilometres through the streets of Seoul (for those who know Seoul better, from Gwanghwamun to Dongdaemun). Plenty of things to see along the way, with the occasional waterfall, symbolic tile wall(s) or seats to sit and relax on. Formerly buried under a highway the stream was renovated in the early 2000's. It has become one of the scenic icons of the city. The controversy with this stream is the need to pump water to keep the stream running!"
242,4.0,"If you've had enough of street food and markets specialising in stationery or shoes or fashion or anything else your heart desires and your wallet can afford then this stream is a haven of peace to stroll along, to sit next to in the shade and listen to the sound of flowing water."
243,5.0,"we strolled along for several kilometres after dinner one night.........it was very relaxing, despite the cool night. we felt very safe and it is well lit along the path."
244,4.0,"Recommend that you get a free-guided tour with the Korea Tourism Organization.  The waiting point is in front of the metro stop near the stream. The tour will go on regardless of the size of the group.  Mr Lee, our Korean guide who spoke good English led us on the 2-hour tour along the stream.  It was a good walk, taking in sights of the occasional egret or shoals of carp in the stream.  You learn how the stream was uncovered, the history behind the long mural tiles, the beautifully painted flood-gates and the buildings on both sides of the stream.  We had good conversations with Mr Lee about Korea, its economy, even K-Pop and the global craze for anything Korean."
245,5.0,"Easily accessed on foot from many hotels. Is a place where you can walk and rest while being in Seoul. . There are some Laser shows with sound besides sounds of 779 horses of a caravan that was composed of 1,779 persons. There is even a show with Fog and music."
246,5.0,After shopping in the market we choose to walk along the path towards our hotel. It is a wonderful oasis in the middle of a very bustling city.
247,3.0,"Sorry, but I thought this looked like nothing more than a large gutter in the middle of the city.  The grey, drab cement was not relaxing.  The water was dirty and there were a lot of people cooling their feet in it.  Some nice hanging flower baskets stretched across one section, which looked good.  The waterfall area close to the giant ""shell/icecream"" at the beginning of the Stream area was one of the better parts.  Adding more rocks, pebbled areas, artworks, etc. would make this a nicer place to visit, but I'm afraid I wasn't impressed."
248,5.0,This Cheonggyecheon stream is a great place that one can walk around. The water is clean. You can see great arts in the wall in some areas of stream.
249,5.0,"I lived in South Korea for four years and whenever my husband and  I visited Seoul in Summer (which was often) , and had time to spare, we visited Cheonggyecheon. Its a pleasant stroll and perfect for people watching. Lots of couples and families on the weekend. Not an outing on its own, but If you're in the area, why not."
250,4.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a creative, man-made water way in the middle of Seoul. It is designed to give residents and visitors a casual, relaxed, open air experience. The stream features food vendors and displays. On our recent visit, we were amused by an egret catching small fish. Great for kids. Close to shopping and dining."
251,5.0,"One of my favourite spots in Seoul, even if it tends to get a little crowded. Thanks to the canal and the colorful lights reflecting back on it, the area has almost a European-feel to it, or at least definitely romantic. On summertime there are live performances and buskers all around, which just adds to the charming mood. You can sit in a cafe and enjoy people watching, or just take a walk along the canal. I always feel relaxed here, even when it gets lively. Couples (too) will love it!"
252,3.0,"Went during the warm days and not as fun as winter time. No decorations like during the holidays. When it's hot, you can't enjoy yourself there. One positive note going during the day, less people. If you want a really good memorable experience then go during the winter!"
253,2.0,Its kinda boring and no lights and lantern on display during winter. So not much to take pictures on.
254,4.0,My wife and I dropped by this stream late at night. There was a singer there and the stream was relatively well lighted up with relevant themes of the season.Mostly couples and groups of young people were sitting down by the stream enjoying the cool of the night.  It is indeed refreshing to see the younger generation enjoying their time together there.  There is just something 'young' about the atmosphere.
255,5.0,"Despite it is daylight, it is very beautiful! Nice and relaxing! It is possible to see and feed fish! It is a nice touch of green for this city."
256,3.0,"After visited palace and Insadong we decided to have a walk back to our hotel in the afternoon, accidentally we found this place well i found this place not really interesting, I am not really sure in the evening but u can find a lot of coffee shop bar and restaurant in that area."
257,5.0,"Really nice walking along the stream with lots of flowers and plants exhibited in different ways,   grown in bottles,  tyres,  buckets etc.  Highly recommend."
258,5.0,"An open sky sewer converted in a river canal, crossing miles alog the city, nice to start from insadong and walk to Dongdaemun."
259,5.0,Far from the maddening crowd. A respite from shopping and eating. Watch out for all the different art exhibits/installations. And special art events at night.
260,5.0,"Dongdaemun shopping area.  I came here to shop and realized I almost miss this place under the bridge.  If you are not paying attention to your surroundings, you will not realized this is the Cheonggyecheon Stream.   I only knew of this place by watching too many KDramas.  Its a lovely place for couples to come and sit around.  I came at 5pm and it was quiet and not many people around."
261,5.0,"I absolutely loved walking Cheonggyecheon Stream during my time in Seoul. Step down into the recessed walking path and it's easy to forget you're in one of the most crowded cities in the world. Returning back to the surface is disorienting, like leaving a dark movie theater in the middle of the afternoon.This stream features lots of interesting architectural features, fountains, and walkways. During the day, it's a welcome spot to relax and enjoy nature. In the evening, it's the perfect spot for a romantic stroll."
262,5.0,"The stream is nice in the day, slightly cooler than walking at street level and youre away from the traffic and bustle. But at night its really great. Seeing the lanterns lit up, listening to the music (which is either from surprisingly talented buskers or via CD depending on where abouts along the stream you are) and enjoying the mist effect which adds atmosphere. Its a nice romantic walk if youre in the city on a couples break!"
263,3.0,"If you happened to be in the area, I would recommend a visit, I didn't find it extremely worthwhile as a 'must go'. I was there during sunset and on a weekend, it was crowded and the river smells a bit stinky."
264,3.0,"This is just another stream or open drain good for a walk to relax after hours of cloth & clothes shopping.The attraction is when they hold festivals with lanterns etc, when the weather is fine.There are some stepping stones under bridges when tourists stop for photos with murals in the background wall.This leads to some popular street hawkers in Insadong"
265,4.0,"This urban stream through the city is good for a nice walk. It is more ""romantic"" in the evening when the sides are lit up, and makes for a good photo op if you have a tripod. Even better if you happen to time your visit around Buddha's birthday in May, when the stream is lit up with Buddha lanterns. You shouldn't come here just for the stream but it is very strategically located near a bunch of sites and restaurants, so the Stream is hard to miss."
266,5.0,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream flows for a few kilometres. Take a peaceful stroll to enjoy it. It should be viewed during the day and night, as there are lights and sounds which add to the pleasure of the Stream.On one side are many tiles explaining an historic procession."
267,5.0,"We were delighted to find a children's boat race happening during our visit, which made our walk down the stream even more enjoyable. The stream is used by many of the locals as a lunch break walk. During a hot day, the stream area was about 10 degrees cooler than the streets, and has a bit more shade. Definitely a must-see during the warmer months. We walked from City Hall to the Bangsan Market area, which is an interesting place to wander around and see all the different shops."
268,3.0,"Many people come here for lunch break and it is was nice on a sunny day to walk along and people watch too. There are some interesting art pieces on the wall along the road which are free, one is a reconstruction of the kings army. the stepping stones and mini waterfalls are very pleasant to see in the middle of the busy buildings around it."
269,3.0,we went in the morning. probably no special decoration during our season. a bit of wall decoration about the tribe of king's outing.
270,5.0,This is a lovely way to walk through Seoul. The stream is designed into different parts to give the feeling of a real outdoor experience. Lots of bushes and greenery. You can cross over via big stones.
271,5.0,What a beautiful sight! A relaxi g place to go for a stroll in the middle of a busy city. It's a bit crowded during the lunch hour. The local business men/women take advantage during their lunch. We went back for the evening light show. It is worth 8 minutes of your trip.
272,4.0,"It's quiet and tranquil along the stream. Can't believe we are just below the street level of a busy boulevard in central Seoul. The sound of the flowing stream and gentle lighting makes the place looks magical at night. We walked past groups of youngster joking around, couples walking along arm in arm and families taking an evening stroll. Nice way to end the day"
273,5.0,"If you can, go here during the lantern festival in the fall. My husband and I spent over and hour walking down the steam marveling at the beautiful lanterns shining on the dark sparking water. After walking down the stream, we walked 5 minutes to a bustling street with tons of great street food, restaurants, and shopping. Even if you can't make it to the lantern festival, the stream is gorgeous all year round!"
274,5.0,"We went for a very long walk, following the course of Cheonggyecheon Stream in the evening and into the night, ending up at DPP, but the stream kept going.It was very pretty in the afternoon sunlight, and there were plenty of locals enjoying it.Note - it's all concrete - this is not a ""natural looking"" stream with dirt banks.  But it's nice all the same.Well worth a stroll."
275,4.0,Place is nice for couple to walk around the stream or just sitting along the stream. The surrounding is a financial district. Big tall building. Stream is best to go at night.
276,4.0,"My encounter with this stream and walking path by it was in Dongdaemun.  It elicits a faint resemblance to the walk along the Seine in Paris but without the river.  It's really just a shallow and relatively narrow stream.  But, it's really pretty peaceful compared to the street scene just above it.  It was actually a very nice walk for the one city block that I walked.  There were no crowds, no bad smells, no trash and it was sort of landscaped with trees, shrubbery and rock placements in the stream. You get up and down to the walkway (paved) via stairs.  If there are elevators, I didn't see them."
277,4.0,"This place was Nic and clean to walk, to hangout with friends. Many festivals were held here, but you will find out so many photographers taking their job around the canal, of course, shooting at girl models."
278,3.0,"After visiting the palace walk toward Gwanghwamun, passed through the statue not very far you will see the big purple/blue shell structure on your left. That is where I started the walk, feel refresh once seeing the waterfall walk a bit further less than 10 meters, there is a spot where you can throw a coin into a hold in the middle of the river, to make a wish. Once you get tired from walking there are plenty of exit to a subway station. Try to make it to the light show in the evening if you have time."
279,3.0,A Nice walk through the city but nothing out of the ordinary unless it happens to be the lantern festival.
280,4.0,"This is a nice place to walk, particularly for couples! It's probably even better in the warmer months, but it's certainly nice in the winter, too!"
281,4.0,Is quite unique as it located in the middle of many buildings . It is11km distance . Definitely  a nice place for couples to hangout there . The scenery at there is worth a visit
282,4.0,This was in walking distance from the Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace and is worth a visit while in the area. You can take a leisurely stroll around the stream and there are large stepping stones you can use to cross the stream to the other side.
283,3.0,Pretty picture but not worth it if you are going just for this. reachable at different spots so do find the one nearest to where you might want to visit.
284,4.0,Great view across the stream. Came across the stream while travelling to dongdaemun. Nothing special
285,4.0,"Having visited Insadong, we walked the short distance to join the stream. I wasn't sure what to expect but I enjoyed the easy walk towards city hall and the ice rink. Although it was day time, we could see the Christmas lights that were dotted around. I'm sure in the evening this is a cute place to walk with a date - very korean!"
286,3.0,"I was a bit disappointed when arriving the site to find it was just a water pipe with a band playing music; totally unlike those found in the picture.  Perhaps, I went to the wrong section just adjacent to the Dondaemun and missed the beautiful section at the other end."
287,5.0,i visit different sections of the stream when i visit Seoul as this is a excellent example of greening the urban space.
288,5.0,"Located near Jongno; this lovely, man-made steam flows seven miles across Seoul. What makes this attraction so special is the innovative design and creative development which makes the stream so unique. Simply take a stroll alongside this wonderful steam and marvel in the beauty of it all.A must visit in Seoul."
289,5.0,This stream is located in the north of Seoul and good for walk and can see many tourist site including dongdaemun market
290,5.0,"Been there before christmas, they have just decorated it with lights. it was really beautiful. You can see the local having fun there. There are many cafes and restaurants around."
291,5.0,Went on a quiet Saturday afternoon with great sun reflecting from the water...see families with small children with shoes off jumping in and out of the water just enjoying the water float and lovely sun; see couples talking just enjoying their time together.  It's so different from a few blocks over in busy bustling shopping area of Myeundong
292,4.0,What a really cool concept. Revitalize an inner city waterway and make it an attraction. Plenty of strolling to be had and it just makes the CBD a better place to be.  The large shell / spiral sculpture named 'Spring' at the head of the stream is an awesome art work and landmark
293,5.0,"We went at the end of the Lantern Festival and were able to see the interesting ""Floats"" of historical and regional themes. Also the tile replica of the Joseon dynasty emperor pilgrimage to father's grave. Well worth the time for a peaceful walk right inside the busy city."
294,4.0,"Nice and clean stream. If you visit in November you can see the lantern festival, its beaitifull and romantic for couples :)"
