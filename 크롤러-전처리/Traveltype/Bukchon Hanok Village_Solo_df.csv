0,3.0,Not sure this place ought to be on the map of places to visit. Followed the walk proposed and did see some old houses and lots of old roofs but when you looked carefully the walls of the ‘old’ houses proved it is brand new houses most of them.
1,4.0,"A traditional resident area. Nice to walk around. I went to an observatory at someones house, 3000won incl tea/coffee, just follow the signs. It was nice and behind glass in the sun so great to warm up at! Also fun shops with handmade stuff around."
2,4.0,"The village is in the residential area, you have to be respectful and not make too much noise. You can walk around the village and see how beautiful the houses were built."
3,4.0,"I joined the Bukchon tour by guides Nayoung and Jenny. Both volunteers were passionate about sharing the Korean history and culture with the group and I had a good time. They initially refused my tips but I insisted. Keep in mind that these young people are not professional tour guides so things could be rough on the edges, but I enjoyed hearing what their lives are like in Seoul."
4,4.0,"This was my 2nd visit here and I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more this time as I was on my own and able to wander around the way I wanted to. Bukchon is a hillside village (almost) of traditional hanok (Korean house) with lots of wood, attention to detail and character. It makes for a lovely contrast between the old and new with views across the rooftops towards modern Seoul. It's definitely worth a mooch around, but be aware that there are very steep slopes and steps so it's not ideal for those with mobility issues or indeed those who are unfit.Bukchon is a short walk from Cheongyecheon/ Myeongdong."
5,3.0,"The architecture is beautiful,  without a doubt. Looks new too, which I guess is expected because you don't expect a 600 years + building to still be standing without work done to restore it. I enjoyed walking in the less popular alleyways where I had the time and space to reflect upon the history of the people who lived here way before my time.Now- these are also people's home and the many signs posted on the walls remind you this, and to be quiet. And even though no one said anything to me it reay felt voyueristic and sorta intrusive.  (I saw 2 or so elderly women walk past tourists on the steps of their houses to get inside). I tried to imagine how I'd  feel like if day in, day out, I had to contend with throngs of tourists taking pictures outside my house. I imagine during the warmer months, opening a window is neat impossible what with the  hoarders of strangers milling about.  Should you go? Depends on you and what you feel comfortable with."
6,4.0,"On a hill between the two famous palaces, this area is very pleasant for a 1-hour stroll around traditional houses. There are a few eating and coffee places."
7,4.0,The Hanok village is conveniently located near the Gyeongongbuk Palace and its definitely worth visiting after leaving the palace. It recreates the “authentic” Korean experience and has a lot of souvenir shopping opportunities. I was unsure of photo opportunity though so I didn’t snap.
8,4.0,Visited this as part of a hop on and off bus tour and spent about 45’ there. Interesting but very touristy... and I found it difficult to watch and understand the performances... but the garden is nice and there are good restaurants nearby!
9,5.0,"If you want to experience this area without throngs of tourists, get up early and walk around in the quiet before 10am.  There’s and easy map with a route to follow for beautiful views of the traditional rooftops and the hills surrounding Seoul.  Gorgeous in November with changing leaves. Fun to watch the area fill up with local tourists wearing charming traditional outfits and posing for photos everywhere!  Easy to get to the places from here too."
10,3.0,There were too many people and I hardly had the chance to snap a decent photo. A very touristy place indeed.
11,5.0,"Spent only 20-25 mins strolling around the traditional village area, but ended up spending another couple of hours enjoying few roads that has all small art shops that houses very pretty range of artwork, postcards, souvenirs, paintings and more! Prepare your cash! The neighbourhood is very peaceful, walk slow and enjoy your quiet time here."
12,4.0,"I liked walking around this village and soaking up the cute architecture, but also the idea that these little walkways have been walked up & down for many many years. Get up to an elevated spot and clock roof after roof in the old style - nice!"
13,5.0,"After visiting the palace, I continued my walk and ended up here at this ancient portion of town, where I believe the homes are about six hundred years old. I walked the alleyways to get a real feel for the homes there. In this area you will also find cute shops and some restaurants. I felt very safe walking around by myself."
14,5.0,"The neighborhood has the largest collection of privately owned hanoks, or traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs, stone floors and amazing wooden doors, in Seoul. It’s located on in a hilly neighborhood nestled between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace which are both walkable for this location. While I strolled through Bukchon Village up, down, back and forth it may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops. These are neat little places to get a look inside on of these beauties majority of them be historically updated renovations but they kept it to the err of time. I really enjoyed my time even while it rained. Remember people still live here so a quiet ordinance is in place and is patrolled."
15,5.0,Nice place walked for about n hour n then left for palace which is near by old traditional houses n people still live their so u need to b decent by not disturbing them n making noise or knocking doors Lots of art houses traditional shops and cafes
16,5.0,"Probably the quaintest part of Seoul, this neighborhood is a great place to spend a Sunday morning. Wander up and down the hill and look at the beautiful old houses with incredible details. There are cafes, small shops, and galleries dotted around for refreshment or a spot of shopping. There are also shops renting our Korean national costumes, perfect for an IG moment!"
17,4.0,"I visited this place in the afternoon at 1630hr to avoid the morning tour groups. There were pockets of visitors exploring this area. It is a general uphill walk to view the traditional houses in narrow lanes, called hanok, that dated back to the Joseon Dynasty.Most of these houses are private residential, hence there are many signs as well as staff to remind visitors to lower their noises. Some of these hanoks operate as souvenir shops, restaurants and tea houses. Well worth a visit together with the nearby palaces."
18,3.0,"If you like long walking, looking at old buildings. Then this is for you. I don't think it's really suitable for people who have difficult in walking because some place as hilly. In order to visit this place, it is very near to Anguk station. After visiting this place, you can also go to Unhyeongung Palace which is around Anguk station as well"
19,4.0,"The village is located on the hill, so you have to walk up a bit. To avoid being lost, you can get a map from tourist information before entering"
20,4.0,"Some dress in the hanbok costumes to do Instagram photos. It's just very picturesque with the hanok houses with tiled pagoda roofs, beautiful doors, walls, flowers, etc. Walking up the alleys there are lots of tourists and one needs to respect the residents and keep the noise down. This traditional Korean village is between the palaces and so worth walking around in to just see the beauty of this architecture."
21,4.0,"Great to visit traditional village and see that these homes are still lived in.  A lot of them have been turned into tea houses , souvenir shops etc. There are some that offer workshops in various Korean crafts. Beware- it is all uphill."
22,4.0,"This historic area is definitely worth a visit while you're in Seoul. I went on a weekday, so it was less crowded than I've heard it gets at the weekends. You'll encounter many people walking around in traditional clothing they've hired for the day - this adds to the atmosphere if you set your imagination to work! The village is hilly and very pretty in the springtime, with some great views over nearby areas of Seoul. The village is still a residential area and offers a contrast to the modernity of all the high-rise apartment buildings, and a link to the past."
23,4.0,"Great to look at, you feel you've stepped back a century. Other than that novelty bear in mind it's a residential area so doesn't really have anything other than the experience of the traditional houses (from the outside only) to offer. Great photo ops."
24,2.0,Not bad but not a lot to see. Fairly packed with tourists even on a rainy day. Expected more to be honest.
25,3.0,"This is people's housing area/resident. At same time they do business such as rent Hanbok, tea/coffee shop, souvenirs.. You can spend sometime here and need to walk up to high slope across all the street. The scenery here is beautiful. You can take few pics on how this unique street looks so traditional and beautiful. I guess for me, its a bit too hype on this place but for me i would give just a average review. Actually nothing much u can do here.. Surrounded by buildings."
26,5.0,It was like being transported back in time. Definitely a must just to observe and admire the architectural feats alone. Take the time to explore this cultural gem. You will not be disappointed!
27,4.0,Visited the village in the weekend and it was very crowded with tourists taking pictures in traditional clothing. The houses looks great and are obviously still inhabited so visitors are requested to be quiet!
28,3.0,This was part of a tour and it's lots of traditional houses in a specific part of Seoul. The houses are not open to the public and before you go you are asked not to make too much noise as its residential. There are people there  with signs saying don't make too much noise. You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically. It would be nice if one hone was on view.
29,1.0,"I feel like this is more a tourist trap than a tourist attraction. Tourist trap because many local businesses overprice their food and drinks, and products.If you want to get the true feeling of a Hanok village, visit the one in Jeonju. Less crowded and great restaurants."
30,5.0,Highly recommend this place for great photos in your hanbok (traditional Korean dress) There are a few store that allows you to rent these costumes for 18000KW for 3hrs. Please take note that you are only allowed to try on a costume twice. Every other time thereafter you will be charged.Visit the palace and try traditional Korean food at reasonable prices. So many cool places to take the perfect-shot.
31,5.0,Take the free map at the information center and they tell you which route you can take to see nice houses and cafes.
32,3.0,I am not reqlly a fan of korean novela but I reqlly want to go here and wear their suit. It was a great experience though there’s a lot of tourist who are taking pictures still I m still hooked.
33,5.0,There are a famous destination for touristActually there still an houses for the local peopleA crowded place..Every door is noted “please be quite.. dont disturb..”But too bad the tourists is cannot read and dont care... talk aloud.. laugh aloud..I just can psssstttttt....hffffttt too bad
34,3.0,"Local old Korean style houses, nice to walk through for a while with interesting small shops and craftmanship stores but not that impressive"
35,5.0,"These heritage homes and streets are nicely preserved and presented.  It's  nice to explore and sample Korean life.It seems to be the number 1 selfie location for Koreans, hire a traditional costum, and join them."
36,4.0,I lived next to bukchon for 18 months. Nice place to wonder around and see some traditional Korean style houses. Just remember people live here so it's not a tourist attraction in the true sense of the word. Be respectful when visiting.
37,4.0,I really liked that the people hired to work here had one job: to keep things quiet. It made a world of difference.
38,4.0,Joined a free walking tour by the Seoul cultural organisation. The area has a lot of traditional restaurants and some specialty shops. This village is around 600 years old and still has some of the traditional Korean houses for homestay or visit. Quite an enjoyable walk with a nice view of the city and the palaces. I prefer shopping around this place than the famous Gangnam area where all the big international brands are.
39,5.0,"Our guide was a retired military man, and he gave us a wonderful tour of this area.  He was very knowledgeable, and was able to pass this on in an interesting way.  I highly recommend Seoul City Walking tours, they truly are free and provide a great way to see the city."
40,4.0,"I took the subway and get off at Anguk station, exit 12 I believe?? I walked straight and saw the area that is Bukchon village. Once you get out from the exit and walk straight, that whole area is Bukchon village. To get to the main area, you must keep going straight and walk for another maybe 10-15 minutes until you see the CU convience store and then turn right. There, you would see a bunch of traditional Hanok houses, and it was very interesting. I recommend to come here, if you like to experience a traditional feeling of Korea. Around the area, there are things to do and see. You can experience many traditional arts and crafts, there are little shops in every corners for you to dive into, and immersed yourself into what you like to do. There are many restaurants and gift stores nearby too. Also, you can wear and rent traditional Hanbok and wear it, while you go around your business in seeing the Hanok village. Overall, it was a great experience, and I sure would go back."
41,4.0,It was an amazing experience that you still could admire the traditional architect of old Korean houses. The village is a residential place with many lovely souvenir shops and tea houses. Be quiet and respect people who live here.
42,4.0,"Great place, unique architectureEnjoyed the visit, people wearing local costumes.Enjoyable trip!  Rafael"
43,1.0,"The village has nice traditional Korean houses. However, they are suffering from tourism. The houses are mostly occupied but families living in them. But tourists are not letting them live happily and with privacy. There are signs by the residents (see photos) indicating that they are suffering. There are signs on most doors asking people to not open doors/knock on them. There are also staff with yellow vests asking tourists to be quiet as they visit the village. Yet, I witnessed so many people talking loudly, knocking on doors and trying to go inside, and many other disturbing behaviors. This is unsustainable and unethical tourism. There are many other places in Korea where you can find that style of architecture. Do yourself and the village a favor and skip this place - let the locals live. I would’ve skipped if I was aware of this problem."
44,2.0,"Well-maintained and surely different from 'Seoul' but crowded with boutique fashion shops, coffee bars and such taking away the charm of an ancient place."
45,5.0,I enjoy visiting bukchon hanok village when in Seoul. It is easily accessible from anguk train station. Though be aware that there is a lot of walking in some quite steep areas. People live and work in these houses so in the evening they have staff posted asking the many tourists to please be quiet. At one part there is a street if interesting stalls and eating places . A lot of people dress in national costume to take photos here and a lot of wedding photos are also take here. Take your time and wear good walking shoes and visit some or all of the open dwellings whilst meandering throhgn
46,4.0,This is a residential area in Seoul and one should have that in mind when visiting the place. It is made of small private homes with history boasting 600 years. The houses are small made with wood and stone on a very peculiar architectural style. Some were turned into small restaurants and coffee shops giving you a chance to see the inside of the houses. Some locals wearing yellow jackets can help you through the narrow streets. The visit should not take long and it is definitely a spot you should not miss.
47,3.0,It’s a good place to go if you want to wonder and browse. There’s plenty of food options in the area. If you’re short on time you could give this place a miss.
48,5.0,"I visited the Bukchon Hanok Village to experience the traditional Korean Houses which are said to be well-preserved over 600 years. It was an amazing experience as you can still appreciate the traditional architecture of old Korean houses first-hand. But I have to warn you that the route is quite hilly and sometimes you can get ""lost"" if you are not mindful enough. But the real challenge is its hilly path. If you are up for an adventure and is fit enough, this is a must visit place in Seoul. To go there just take Subway Line 3 (Orange Line) and alight at Anguk Station and use Exit 3. It will take you there."
49,5.0,No visit to Seoul would be complete without a stroll through the Bukchon Hanok Village.  Wander through the hilly neighborhood and imagine what it was like walking in Seoul hundreds of years ago.  You can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean formal dress) for both sexes at numerous rental places nearby to wear for a few hours or a day to enhance your Bukchon Hanok Village experience.  The best photo opportunity is at the top of the hill.  It will be obvious where that is once you ascend the hill.  At the top of the hill you’ll see handmade signs leading you to the  “Bukchon Overlook”.  This is not an official overlook but simply an older gentleman  who charges admission to look out from his top floor about 6 stories up.  He serves you a drink and there are some nice photo opportunities so it is worth the 3000 won IMO.  He also has a cute parrot.  I got a kick out of his business acumen because he does attract numerous tourists.
50,4.0,It is nice and cute to walk in the little streets. Nice artshops in the area.However after 1hr you have seen everything.
51,4.0,"Well worth a walk around this area.  As people live there, you must be quiet.  Really liked the architecture.  Easy to find."
52,4.0,"Bukchon is the natural link between two palaces and therefore a natural stop over. Rich in small exhibitions, artworks, old historical houses. Plenty of cafes, small shops and restaurants. Go for it!"
53,4.0,Is was advertised that it is open until 9:00 PM so by the time I arrived at 6:30 PM most of the local artist studios were closed. But the main road has dozens of restaurants and other food establishments open. Come earlier!
54,4.0,Seems like place where artisans like to set up shop. Unfortunately I was unable to explore further as there was a heavy downpour.
55,4.0,"There is not much to see here, but it's a great walk around this area.After you see the palace which is closeby, you can then visit this attraction."
56,4.0,A traditional Korean village inside the city. They have preserved the heritage. You have to walk up and you can take photo with the headless traditional figurines n front of the village!
57,3.0,I think this is a nice place to go once time but I think this's enough for me. I dont think this is the old village. That's the new village build by the old style.
58,5.0,This old village is a perfect spot to see the city on the horizon during the sunset!There is a bit of climb to reach it but is totally worthy.
59,5.0,"A really beautiful neighborhood with lots and lots of traditional style deigned houses on a steep hill slope. This is actually a residential neighborhood so visitors are requested to keep the noise down you will see people holding signs advising visitors to respect the residents and not make noise.The village basically opens to the public at 10am at which time I am told lots and lots of coachloads of tourists arrive and the place changes into a busy and bustling area. Fortunately I left me hotel in the very early morning and arrived there shortly after sunrise when there were zero tourists. However, actually visitors are not meant to be here so early but I was alone and making no noise at all.Along the many lanes can be seen beautiful architecture with ornate roofs and wood details. Views of Seoul Tower can often be seen in the distance. This is definitely a fantastic place to visit and should not be missed."
60,4.0,It was so nice to see traditional houses of South Korea. It's well worth visiting and in a really nice area of Seoul. Lots of nice restaurants around too. Highly recommended.
61,4.0,"Went here to check out the traditional architecture, definitely enjoy checking out the area! Enjoyed seeing what a traditional village would look like. There are a few different shops, didn't find it crowded and its a decent enjoyable walk."
62,5.0,Very traditional houses surround this area.Take 1-2 hours waking around here without any destination.Enjoy the houses and atmosphere here.這個地方有很多傳統的房屋。花個一到兩個小時在這邊沒有目的地與目的性地亂走，好好享受這邊的房屋與氛圍。
63,3.0,"is great place, really. but i only give 3 rating due to this area is residential, not really some place u can go as you like. at first, i was though this is a heritage site but in fact this is a residential area, it make me shocked. hard to imagine i living in a house where there is a ton of people walking around my house everyday looking (peeking) into my house. so, it is really a great place, but please be considered to visit this place due to privacy problems."
64,5.0,was there with hyeyoung ...lovely place lots of tiny shops and alleyways great place for photo opportunities ...but keep in mind that it’s still a residential area and people remind you to keep it low!!!!!a couple of hours are possible if you plan to have lunch there ...would be apprehensive for people with knee back problems as the rounds are a tad steep !!! comfy shoes are a must !!nice places to enjoy coffee or lunch
65,5.0,"it’s good to walk around:)there’s lots of small shops and great Hanok.It was so impressive I think, and I do recommand you to go here"
66,4.0,"While I believe that the area is well preserved and stunning architecturally, the atmosphere is kind of destroyed by the large posters saying, 'No Tourists'. Make sure you keep quiet, especially in the morning as the locals don't particularly want you there. Aside from that, it's a very beautiful and historic area of Seoul and I do believe you should visit."
67,3.0,Nice to see and ok for half day - yet too commercialized and full of shops ... logistics is good and helpful info points are everywhere — is a should do when visiting Seoul
68,5.0,I spent a half day wandering the streets and lanes of this beautiful village. A great place to just wander and get lost to experience traditional Korean buildings and homes. Be prepared for a few steep hills.
69,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village located adjecent to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Great place to find Korean architecture with no entrance fee. It was peaceful to walk and explore the narrow streets of Bukchon and view from the top was just magical. There are shops were you could rent korean traditional dresses. Guesthouses are available for rent within the village. You may visit the traditional craft experience centre and attend the workshop with a small participation fee. As it is a residential area therefore, strict policy on noise and littering needs to be followed.Visiting hours are restricted to 10 am to 5 pm Mon - Sat Quick Tip: Make sure to wear comfortable shoes as the sight is pretty hilly and takes couple of hours to explore it entirely."
70,4.0,"In my imagine , Bukchon Hanok is ancient village ( as Old architectures something ) . It was modernized by all new painted walls and become a tourist spot . Nothing i found is exceptional here :)ㅠㅠ one tip : if you had a good camera, wear hanbok and pose thousand of photos by your ways :)"
71,4.0,Lovely hanoks to admire but it’s good to be really quiet so as not to disturb the residents living there. If we put ourselves in the shoes of the residents we wouldn’t want our day to day life to be disturbed by tourists either.
72,4.0,The village has been very well maintained.  It is a great place to walk around and see the Hanok houses. An easy walk from the two main palace attractions.
73,4.0,"i dont know if there was anything else going on when i went but the was hardly anyone around, which made for a really nice relaxing atmosphere as apposed to a crowded crazy one. the area is so nice and the small cafes and shops were all really cute too~!"
74,4.0,I would plan at least a half day to spend in Bukchon - such a beautiful area and hard to believe you are still in Seoul when you are there - lots of uphill walking so bring your sneakers! Plenty of little boutique shops and cafes - perfect for a relaxing afternoon
75,3.0,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is undoubtedly on a lot of tourists radar during their visits to Seoul - but a lot has changed! I stopped by here after visiting the nearby Palaces, especially as Lonely Planet recommended it as a ""must-see"" part of Seoul. However, due to the high volume of tourists, the residents inhabiting the village (it's one of the last areas you can see this traditional architecture) make it very clear that loud noise, pictures, etc. are not welcome or appreciated. I personally just walked through to appreciate the area, but couldn't stay very long as a result. If you want to go, it is a really special part of Seoul, but do keep the ""warnings"" in mind."
76,5.0,"Amazing how did the village still kept it’s old look and modernized at the same time ... I would really advice people to visit the village however, it would be very much appreciative to be quite as the people are negatively affected by tourist and kept silence is something really good, the architecture of the place is well maintained I loved the place ManalOman"
77,4.0,"Even tho locals don't like you visiting as they feel it's invading their privacy, it is a beautiful street with lovely traditional houses worth seeing. Just be mindful that people live there and dont make too much noise."
78,4.0,"What's not to like?  It is interesting, free, sandwiched between other sites you are likely to visit and a good place for a nice stroll.  It is much more pleasant and less crowded than the more frantic, packed Namdaenum market."
79,3.0,There’s not much here to see. It’s worth a 30 minute visit if you’re in the area. There is one street where you can take a picture.
80,5.0,You can walk around the streets and look at all the cute shops that the area has to offer. I found a place where you can drink some traditional Korean beverages. It is a little bit expensive but the drinks are great so I would just go for it and enjoy the experience.
81,4.0,This is a hilly part of Seoul amidst two royal palaces. Clean and safe but seems that - according to many notes on houses - the residents do not feel very happy about the many and loud tourists.
82,3.0,"I was expecting more but it was just nice. You should get a map from the tourist info guides (red t-shirts) before going in, the map has got recommended walks withing the village. From a Tourist Information Office near Anguk Station I also got a map of the area. Insadong Street and Changdeokgung Palace are close by, I even walked here from Gyeongbukgung Palace. So it's not a wasted journey if you do not find the village that interesting as there are other tourist places to visit within walking distance."
83,5.0,Having ancient houses in a modern city is an amazing combination. Love the view of modern seoul from an ancient village. Lot of Interesting thing to explore and take nice pictures.
84,4.0,actually i don't stay in city of seoul quite long time & always went to countryside in my short tour in last autumn. but i take this bukchon hanok village. easy to reach here & area was quite big actually. some place was crowded but some quite. good for viewing historical korea house. spend a day here to walk around & take picture. enjoyable.
85,4.0,"The houses More interesting to look at. However, there were signs asking tourists not to come in because it was disrupting their lifestyle there. And many signs asking people to be more quiet."
86,4.0,Lots of cool shops ranging from inexpensive to high end.Full of cafes and restaurants as well as museums and art galleries
87,4.0,"Though I felt bad about walking around in this area because of all the sign telling tourists to keep their voices down and not disrupt the neighbourhood, since this is a residential area first and foremost, but it was still a really worthwhile place to visit. It did feel a little closed off though because every house had high walls and gates or bars to keep tourists from trampling around."
88,5.0,"Visited during my Essential Seoul Tour. These are the original Hanok houses. Some are open for visitors, art galleries, you can take a peak inside (shoes off first)."
89,4.0,"Would recommend to visit when you're in Seoul, the view from the hill is pretty nice, and seeing many traditional houses is really something, when i visit, there are many tourists taking pictures, a little bit crowded, it's a residential area, so it's better to not make any noise while there."
90,5.0,"Greatest views of the city. Great historic village. Wonderful cafes and art scene. Get a feel for how the elite lived hundreds of years ago. It is still an active residential district , so be mindful and respectful for people who live there. Visit the tourist center at the base of the hill for a local map and what not to miss. Great tourist tips from friendly staff."
91,3.0,"You can see some nice traditional streets and houses (hanoks), but it can be a pain to find them. The so-called ""observatory"" is just a small top-floor apartment where you are asked to pay to enter - however the old lady is kind and gives you ""free"" tea, coffee or juice. You can only enjoy the view through windows.If you have a day for it, visit Jeonju for a real hanok village!"
92,3.0,"Nice houses. But way too many tourists. Need a fair bit of walking to get here. Other than taking OOTDs, There's a tokudu museum in 1 of the houses. Very interesting information about the past death rites of the Korean. Admission is free, takes less than 1/2 hr to see. Worth it to go in to take a look."
93,4.0,"It is pretty nice but touristic. To me, it doesn't has an original character. It's just for tourists who walk around and take pictures. If you have time, you should go there. If not, you won't miss anything. Seoul has a lot of beautiful places..."
94,5.0,The Village is quite big for Traditional Korean Village.  People are still live in the Village so that make it unique.
95,5.0,A must visit! So much fun walking all around town and seeing the true Korean culture! Good Times....
96,5.0,Quietness all around. Cozy tea or coffee shops. Arts boutiques. Private houses well maintained. Ancient and elegant ambience. Not to miss.
97,4.0,Spent sometime walking through the village and and is interesting to see the wooden houses. It's pretty close to a metro station is one the things to do in Seoul.
98,5.0,Feels stepping into 700 years ago in the heart of modern Seoul. Small houses preserved and all renovated and converted to small shops and restaurants and B&B. Nice walk and exploring time.
99,4.0,"Beautiful place to spend a afternoon, looking some designs, art, color and great coffee shops. U can wear a traditional clothes there and walk around."
100,4.0,"It was nice to see the place and the street but I was expecting  more traditional  houses and the life styles  of people. But this place become  more touristic  and less traditional ,  but it's good to see it"
101,3.0,"Worth a quick wander to see the old houses, and enjoy views of old-and-new side-by-side. Rather full of touristy shops though."
102,4.0,Really a good place to go. It is a real houses so you shouldnt make noises there because the neighborhood..Come here and rent hanbok.. You will feel like in historical drama
103,4.0,This place is so cultural. Many traditional architecture houses and tea rooms. You can have many good photo spots here.
104,5.0,"I highly recommend visiting the village, although it is set apart from the rest of the tourist area. I took a free tour offered by the city's tourism department, which took me to two museums, gave me some history of the city, and had great views! The day I went was quiet, although the guide said usually there were a lot more people. There are also some places to get Korean street food, some traditional tea houses, and a few shops with clothing and souvenirs."
105,3.0,"This is a residential area with some korean themed houses, there is nothing much else to do in this area. I wouldn't not make it a priority."
106,3.0,"I went there to kill some time during a layover of my flight. It was easy to get there by underground and then to have a nice walk around the area. It’s actually a residential area which still bears the traditional style of old times Korea. Unfortunately you can’t enter the houses since they are private, but there are some photogenic spots and also some nice tea houses and shops."
107,3.0,"If you happen to be around, it’s worth it to stop by for a few pictures, but there’s nothing that special to do.Somehow I feel that the people around prefer not to be disturbed by tourists."
108,5.0,Samcheong dong is a quaint neighbourhood just east of Gyeongbokgung palace. It's filled with small cafes and restaurants; art galleries and museums as well as boutiques. Here you may also find some colourful murals and interesting art installations. You can walk through Samcheong dong en route to the Bukchon traditonal Hanok village which is very close by and a great way to experience some Korean culture and history.
109,3.0,"The are is neat. If you're looking for a nice walk, then this place is worth going to. The pictures basically capture what you'd see so you won't miss much not going. It's a little hard to find the right alleys so make sure you get your hands on a map that shows you the route that you need to walk. You can find one at the cultural centre or with one of the tourist helpers that stand around some intersections."
110,4.0,"More authentic than Insa-dong, BHV offers a few quiet walks along narrow lanes, mostly car-free. A nice rest from the busy capital, and an interesting way to discover a more authentic side of Korea. A bit hilly, wear good shoes. Be sure to grab a map at the visitor centre.The closest station in Anguk."
111,5.0,"Came here early before I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The area is so photogenic, everywhere is a photo spot. As it is a residential area, there are signs urging tourists to keep the noise level down. It is a refreshing experience seeing how old Korean houses look like and comparing it to the high rises that they have now."
112,5.0,This area is gorgeous and very historic.  People still live here.  It tends to get very busy so plan to go in off-peak times.  It’s great to be able to see such a preserved piece of Korean history.
113,5.0,"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon, which literally translates to ""northern village,"" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture,.... a must see in Seoul."
114,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village was amazing! Filled with quirky shops, delicious food and traditional architecture. It's surrounded by palaces, galleries and museums so if you plan your day you can walk through Bukchon whilst visiting palaces and galleries."
115,4.0,Viewing old traditional houses gives you some nostalgic feel to the the culture. Traditional architecture of the Hanok house  acquaints the visitor on the wisdom of how the hanoks were built with surrounding materials available with a view of the family as a basic social unit and the how the community lived. And it is a good contrast with nearby vibrant Samcheong-dong area and Seoul’s cafe culture.
116,4.0,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is a charming village with lots of traditional Korean houses called “hanok”. Some of these houses go back to the times of the Joseon Dynasty. Bukchon lies north of the Cheonggyecheon Stream. At the time of my visit, various tourists hired local costumes and dressed up in the traditional way. There were a few shops selling souvenir items and snacks. The village has guesthouses and tea rooms. In essence the hanoks are like small culture centres where you can learn and gain experience of traditional Korean culture. It would be best to take the metro to Anguk station and walk from there. Admission is free.You should aim to spend between sixty to ninety minutes here."
117,4.0,"The Hanok Village is neat to see, but if you come just as an attraction itself it might be a bit  disappointing.  Since it is so close to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Insadong you should try to visit all of these things as well as the Hanok Village as they are all within walking distance.It was neat to see the buildings and there are shops where you can dress up in traditional dress and take pictures along the way as well.Things to Note:1) Keep your voices down as it is still a neighborhood where people live2) There are wonderful tea houses, I recommend you stop at one for the experience and the view.  An example would be Cha Masinuen Tteul,  located along Bukchon-ro 5 na gil3)  There are several must see views while in the Bukchon Hanok Village.  ""Bukchon 8 Views"" is where people can fully enjoy the beauty of hanoks and the alleys in the area. Seoul has nominated eight different views and has set up ""Photo Spots,"" from which you can easily find delight in the surroundings inside of Bukchon in order to develop the area as a Seoul’s most representative cultural tourist attraction. Reserach them before you go so you don't miss one :)I would probably allocate an hour or two at the most to the village if you include the tea stop."
118,3.0,A pretty area to walk around but it might be best to go with a tour as that would be more meaningful.
119,4.0,"A few places where you can see traditional Korean houses in Seoul. Very good place. The residents are still living, but the Chinese tourists are lousy."
120,5.0,"There are lot of shop offers cheap hanbok rental as u wish to wander around the alleys and take cute picture. Its advisable to not make noise as this alleys now become residential area. Take time to walk around as enjoy the fine architerature arts. And there also convenient store, cafe and galleries around."
121,5.0,"You can get lost in the Street of this very cosy place, really feeling to be in a village and not in Seoul"
122,3.0,"OK residential area to walk around in and grab pictures. There will be some small exhibits, cafes, and vendors around. Avoid during humid or hot summer days, there's a serious lack of shade and a ton of uphill areas."
123,2.0,"I heard so many good comments about this place. Once I got there, I got very dissapointed. Its a little town in the middle of Seoul but nothing to do around. There is a few restaurants and shops but nothing interested. Definitely I wouldn't go back to this place. It was boring!!!"
124,3.0,"Korean travelers seemed to enjoy this the most.  It was interesting to see the architecture, but it is a small area and is flooded with people. I feel sorry for the residents!If you only have a couple of days in Seoul, this should not be one of your stops. The tea house where you turn right off the main street is a gem of a find though."
125,3.0,"Strolled around here, and yes the houses are beautiful, the narrow streets are cute and the craftsmen are nice, bit all in all my opinion was that it was overrated. Of course, this is not 'how people used to live in the old days' (fortunately): this is an idealized one-dimensional (and yes, very cute) view of the past, in ultra clean, perfectly restored Hanok houses loaded with gift shops (which says enough... :-))."
126,4.0,Started an early walk to Bukchon. Don't expect to see anything much as most places are close before 9am. Nevertheless a good walk without the normal crowd when you are early . Some cafes are already open at 9am
127,5.0,"Bukchon is a fun area to walk around in. There's a lot of cute stores and restaurants along the main streets, but it's also fun to explore some of the more residential streets further north/uphill. There are some great views and lots of picturesque traditional homes. I recommend ditching the maps (resistance is futile) and not worry about getting a little lost."
128,3.0,"I was quite disappointed with this place ... it's nothing more than just visiting rows of homes built centuries & decades ago. I was expecting the place to offer greater authenticity, culture & history ... but instead there are modern shops, cafes and private homes with 'Silence please' notices on their closed doors (obviously constant flow of tourists is not quite welcome here). I didn't even get chance to see the inside of a home in this so-called village. Be prepared for the uphill (literally... some of the roads are almost like 45 degrees!) and downhill climb ... so you'll need strong leg muscles and good walking shoes ... no heels! And certainly not for the elderly. Personally I'll advise my friends to give this place a miss ... it's really nothing to shout about."
129,5.0,"It is well worth a wander through this historical residential neighbourhood containing over 900 traditional Korean houses or hanoks. The narrow streets meander through the relatively confined area and contain many small artist and artisan studios, the odd traditional tea houses and a range of curio shops. There is very little traffic so it is easy to lose yourself in the exploration."
130,5.0,"Hilly walk with sweeping views and small workshop places where you could take a class or just watch others crafting away. Cool to see so many dressed up in hanbok (traditional clothing). Find the library and take a break there, too."
131,4.0,Good place for a 3hr tour. Most residents are already used to the invading eyes of tourists peeking into their homes. Uphill/downhill narrow streets . Outside of the hanok village are many good restaurants including touristy ones. A great place is the steak house just at the road junction at the entrance to the billage. You can't miss it.
132,4.0,one of the old quarters of seoul where the traditional houses have been renovated. it gives a good view on the living conditions of wealthy Korean families in oldersn times.
133,5.0,"Seoul's largest concentration of Hanok, traditional Korean homes that dates back to the Josean Dynasty. It's a busy tourist area, but it's still a pleasure to get lost in the streets here admiring the patterned walls and tiles roofs contrasting with the modern city in the distance. Many operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses providing visitors an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse in traditional Korean culture. Anguk Station Subway Line 3 Exit 1/2."
134,3.0,"This area is often described as a 'living-museum' but that oversells it. The walls in the area are plastered with posters advising where you cannot take pictures and constantly telling you to stay quiet. I understand this is due to the fact that people live and work here but then there are stalls exploiting the tourists who are playing music out loud to attract people. A strange place which, though not exceptionally busy, still a tourist spot through and through. Not that much to do or experience."
135,4.0,I love this place. I visited Bukchon Hanok Village right after GyeongBokGong in my rented hanbok. I felt a different vibe walking around in my hanbok. Should give it a try ( you wont be the only person walking in a hanbok).
136,2.0,"Be smart to avoid becoming one of the non-sensible tourists who just follow what most others did....unless you are a westerner who has never visited the east and seen nothing about Chinese/Asian-styled temples or architecture online.There you could only see the walls mainly, and some roof, that was all. Not a big area, just two to three small streets. It was rather ridiculous (for me at least) that so many tourists went there and caused disturbances to the living residence, thus there were many notices reminding tourists to keep quiet now. While there was not much to see or not easy to get any surprise, one worthwhile thing you can do is perhaps renting a set of ""Hanbok"" (Korean traditional clothing) at a cheap price of W10,000 and then take photos. But better do this in the early morning, or more and more tourists will be there."
137,5.0,"First of all - it's residential area, so don't talk loud and behave nicely :)Second of all - try going there in the early morning if you want to avoid crowds and take pictures of empty streets. Otherwise wait and queue.Third - if you come early, be prepared that most of cafes and shops open there around 10 to 11 am.Overall definitely worth a visit if you want to see traditional culture and buildings."
138,5.0,I went on a free walking trip to Bukchon village on June 18 . It was luckily a small group of 6 and we had 2 guides Ms Jua and Ms Diam. The tour started on time at second exit of Anguk Station and lasted about 2 hours. It was informative and interesting and very enjoyable if it was on very sunny hot Seoul day.
139,5.0,"Really cool, small, historic houses in the middle of modern Seoul.  Definitely worth stopping by for some great pics."
140,5.0,"A great area to visit. Wonderful traditional Korean homes with very interesting architecture. A nice walk from the city if you leave somewhere around City Hall, Soedemum or Myeongdong areas. A nice choice of restaurants and specialty stores in the Bukchon area."
141,4.0,Super nice and pretty village. There are still people living here so tourists are told to be quiet at all time. It is better to follow the suggested path to walk so you won't get lost. Worth visiting!
142,5.0,"walk around this neighborhood is so great.surrounded by mountain and the house in this neighborhood actually very traditional.and yes people do live here, its not just an attraction of empty traditional house.just take ur time and get lost in this area.wonderful"
143,3.0,"I visited other traditional villages in South Korea that were much more interesting.  I believe a couple craft shops were open, but aside from architecture, there really wasn't much that interested me."
144,5.0,Another place you have to experience -its a total contrast to the modern skyscraper Seoul and thankfully it have not been bulldozed down....
145,3.0,Is good for picture taking. Otherwise nothing special at there.Nearby Gyeongbukgong palace. Beside that there is few souvenir shop around.
146,1.0,"Title says it all, this is just a collection of 'traditional' houses. Nothing really special as the houses have a very modern feel about them. Lots of toerists in traditional Korean dress which about sums up the authenticity of this place. Skip."
147,5.0,"This quaint and charming neighborhood situated in the center of Seoul is truly a sight to behold. With 600 years of history, and architecture and culture not found elsewhere in the capital, this is indeed a ""must-see"" on your Korean Itinerary."
148,4.0,"Lovely historic buildings and houses make this an interesting place to visit. I was not able to locate the tourist information office that was marked on my map so I was really unsure of where to start. There are some maps up that show the premier spots. I was a bit concerned for the people who live here as floods of people are loudly trekking through their neighborhood, taking pictures of their property and sometimes even entering their homes as their were many signs up identifying private property."
149,3.0,"There are only a few sections of the village that are worthwhile. Otherwise, it is too modernized (people actually live in those houses). I guess I expected a isolated neighbourhood frozen in time. Bring a map with an itinerary so that you dont wander needlessly."
150,5.0,I enjoyed walking around here. the walk has an inclined pathway and it was difficult for me since I went here at the end of my DIY trip for the day! Best to go here in themorning when you ahve full of energy. But everything is worth it. Very Korean at all aspect. These are actual private residences so always keep quiet while touring around.
151,3.0,"A part of Seoul with old houses. As these houses are private, you can't enter them.Beware of the art shop in the beginning of this village - they try to rip-off you.And also beware of a private observatory on the top of the hill. You can see signs to this private observatory which leads you the wrong way. Better to go up to a long street where many free lookouts are available."
152,5.0,Took me back to bygone days.Do visit the information centre first.Volunteers give free tour.Pick up a very useful map to help walking round the area.
153,5.0,"I've been there on a transit tour by Incheon airport.It's a nice area with an old houses. Most of them are residences, so you need to be quite"
154,4.0,This is definitely a highlight if you are in the area and seeing the palaces either side of it. You won't spend long here since there is only a couple of streets that actually contain the old houses but they are very photogenic.
155,5.0,"quiet and beautiful village, remind you and give you a picture of an old Korean people's villages, beautiful experience within this village,there are places to buy souvenirs"
156,5.0,"This is a real residential area which are not specially made for tourists.The owners of the houses are still staying in the house. Therefore, tourists are always being reminded to be silent.A must go in Seoul to experience the old seoul culture. Quite a bit of up hill and down hill walk but definitely worth the visit."
157,3.0,See the traditional style of houses which are still lived in today. Many have been converted into shops & studios but plenty are still lived in. There are some nice views over the city from the top of the hill.
158,5.0,"It was raining but still fun to be walking along the ancient alley.By passed some shaggy old gift-shops & fragrant house that leads to a hilly pebble route to the hilltop. The view is fogged by pollution from China so the post-card view is not there, still there are old architecture and natural landscape that's worth the walk.TO enhance on photography & free entry, rent traditional Hanbok from Insadong  for 4hrs 10,000Krw which will definitely bring memory and joy looking at them years later. ALSO, Hanbok-wearer has free admission to UNESCO sites: Gyeongbukkong, Museum, Village... etc"
159,5.0,The traditional houses in the hanok is very well an inspiration for building designer bunglows in today's era!! I liked it very much.
160,3.0,Alight at Anguk stn exit 1/2. Pretty much a distance(to me) from the station. There are maps nearby to facilitate the search. U can take pictures but be silent pls. There are a few convenience stores on the way.
161,5.0,"You can get a sense of days gone by when you stroll around Bukchon Hanok Village - A Hanok is the name for a traditional Korean house and there are some 800 of them in and around Bukchon.  You have to hunt for scenes where there are no electricity lines, tourists or other modern paraphernalia for your perfect photo.  You do get a sense that many of the properties have be restored with modern materials and the area seems gentrified with trendy art and food outlets in and around the village to cater for the tourists."
162,5.0,"A dream come through to visit this village. It was a lovely walk around the many streets of the village and taking pics at the famous spots no.5 and 6. I even located the hanok used in the kdrama ""Personal Taste"". Best to go early to avoid big tour groups. I got there before 9:30am on a Sunday and it was not crowded yet. It would be great to stay in a hanok style accommodation for my next visit to Seoul!"
163,5.0,"Must visit!Located very close to the palaces and Insadong, i recommend to spend one day in these environment, plus the contemporary museum.End your day in this particular area to experience the nice upscale street stalls..dining was great."
164,5.0,"A good place to go to visit an actual residential area of Traditional Korean Houses. You just need to keep quiet though as posted on the signs within Bukchon Hanok Village. Not an easy place to pinpoint though, I wandered around a bit before I was able to find the place."
165,3.0,"This district is packed with over 900 hanoks, traditional Korean houses. It retains the city's old appearance. It has bceom a popular filming location for movies and TV dramas. As it is still a residential area, so please respect the residents there. They do hanbok rental, traditional Korean clothing. So you can wear the hanbok and take pictures in front of these traditional Korean housing. Many retail shops selling survivors. A little bit pricey since it is tourist attraction place."
166,4.0,Its good to see the architecture of the traditional homes. You can even take pics of yourself in a hanok traditional wear) in some stores. I wish i could've spent a night in a traditional home but they are quite expensive! Would love to go back to see it during the winter covered partially in snow
167,5.0,"Bukchon is a place that you must visit while in Seoul. It's a neighborhood where you can see several traditional Korean houses. It is a residential area, so be respectful and try not make too much noise. I went early in the morning, around 9 and there were very few people there. It was great to take admire and take amazing pictures. From there you can see N Seoul Tower and it is amazing to see the contrast of the city around it.To reach the neighborhood stop at Anguk station, exit 6. Stop at the visitor center where you can get more information and map to explore the area and go to the top of the hill to see the cluster of houses. There are some houses that offer stay and tea ceremonies I did not participate."
168,4.0,"I love this place. I love culture and traditional houses in Korea. Walking around, there's a combination of modern and traditional buildings. It really reminds me how important for us, not to forget our roots."
169,4.0,"Come there must be silence, its beauty and amazing view there... you may try to rent at homestay there to try experience living korea traditional houses"
170,4.0,"The experience was one of ""uniquely fun"" walking along these narrow streets flanked on both sides by traditional-styled houses or lovely compound walls (with roofs above as is the style unique to Japan & Korea) while pretty frequently having to negotiate the upward & downward slopes along the way (""steeper slopes"" on the left side than on the right side of the main street Bukchon-ro that divides the Village into two parts).  And while some might just do a simple walk-around, I suggest checking out some 'workshops' which are on the right side of the Village (got to my first workshop after walking up for about 10 minutes to the right from the main street, followed by three more workshops including one for embroidery called The Han Sang Soo Embroidery Workshop and one for calligraphy or designs), and do keep in mind that they're not museums but places where people are actually doing stuff and where tourists can ""partake in"" their activities (not sure if you need like a prior booking for such though); and on the left side of the Village, be sure to go all the way to the far end where there's like a terrace with a railing from which there are great views of the mountains (not too far) and the city's skyline (somewhat distant).Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is where to get off, and the best exit is Exit 2 with just about a 5-minute walk straight ahead on the main street Bukchon-ro after coming out of the exit and you'll be right at the area where a right turn or a left turn will lead you up to the corresponding part of the Village (so yes, the right side for the 'workshops' and the left side for the lookout terrace at the far end as mentioned above; and my suggestion is to do the right side of the Village first, then cross the main street to the left side, then come back down from the far end on that side where you'll get to like a ""shopping street"" below that kind of intersects the main street after a few minutes' walk bringing you conveniently back to near Anguk Station for leaving the Village)."
171,5.0,perfect to do on the same day: the Palace Gyeongbokgung; Hanok Bukchon and the Buddhist temple. I really enjoy because it's like an outdoor architecture museum but actually people still leaving there.
172,4.0,I used to take a walk from Myeongdong through Insa-dong and Samcheong Dong to reach here.Actually not very far but you can find the Korean’s life along this walk.
173,5.0,Great to walk round the old buildings. Interesting shops cool cafes and eateries. Sometimes a bit up hill but great to visit.
174,5.0,"As cute as it sounds, this place does not have a main entrance that says 'Bukchon Hanok Village'. You just get to Samcheongdong and get up at any small hills that you see. The area around this place is somewhat magical and hard to believe. It was cold when I was there, leaving slippery icy roads to conquer. Lots of people with large cameras and hanbok. You will find coffee shops and perfume houses along the way. It was only a 15 walk up and down depending on how long you spend your time in the hills."
175,5.0,"This is not a place to rush. Plan to be around for an hour or even more. Eat from the street stalls or from a local restaurant, then explore the streets and alleys with your camera at the ready. The tour buses mainly unload here in the afternoon, so try get here in the mornings."
176,5.0,I visited this charming little village with the Korea airport free tour. The village that once only inhabited by the nobles are all about narrow alleys and traditional houses with typical roofing.
177,5.0,"This is a great place to see the real Korean village.  it is a steep climb as some of the streets the branch off the main street are usaually up hill.  There are traditional houses, shops, cafes...  f you go high enough up you will have nice views looking over Seoulthere is also a small Korean temple that I ran across.  it is pretty small and you have to go upstairs.  This is a great place to walk around and get lost.  sometimes the people that live there will have their doors open and you can see in.  don't go up to the door but just look as you are passing by.  great architecture"
178,5.0,"My favourite area in Seoul! Down the hill is a lot of cozy streets filled with trendy shops and cafeterias! While coming up the hill you'll find yourself within streets among old traditional houses! Don't forget to look back while walking up, some streets boost amazing views over the city center!"
179,5.0,Cute replica of old Seoul. Some houses are inhabitat by locals or foreigners.Reminds of Disneyland but everything in Korea looks like that nowdays
180,5.0,"On the advice of local friends I visited very early in the morning and walked up from Anguk Station. Although not too busy with visitors, there were already other people arriving so I can only imagine how crowded it gets. The houses are beautifully preserved and give a good insight into how Seoul may have looked during the Joseon Dynasty.  I loved just wandering along the alleys noticing the roof details, intricate doorways and courtyards.Although Bukchon is a preserved village rather than a reproduction tourist attraction it is, not surprisingly, commercial, with many of the houses converted into galleries, guest houses and tea rooms but you can look beyond it and just appreciate the history.I visited very early in the morning and was able to wander around at my own pace and not feel too intrusive.  Be prepared for a lot of walking up sloping streets!"
181,4.0,"It is said that Mandarines in pre-modern days dwelled here. Surprised to know that traditional dwelling were still kept in the area that is very close to the center of Seoul.Location is convenient,only taking subway for 5-10 minutes from the City Hall or Seoul Station, even though transtion of subway is required.Area in itself is not so big. had little steep ways.There had Constitutional Tribunal besides the area.Some shops held splashy signs before the facade, which broke atomosphere.When I went, other visitors are not so many, so I was able to walk around with keeping my pace.One house that seemed to have got renovation for exhibiting for visitors,where I entered and walked around inside, saw many traditional Korean daily items, which I did not know how to say, as pots for Kimchi cooking and traditional Korean style heater."
182,4.0,"Great place to observe the palace from behind the walls. Its a long walk/trail about 60 minutes to complete the different observable areas or landmarks. A few up slopes and down slopes. The place also houses museums, hands-on workshops. On top of that, quaint souvenir shops and cafes and eating outlets. You can get the map from the tourist information centre in the area. The observant point is quite breathtaking.Be sure to be quiet as you walk with your friends or families as it is a residential area. You won't want to disturb the residences there."
183,5.0,An hour walk in this area is sufficient. You can enjoy the beautiful architecture of houses.  Will definitely stay in one of the guest houses here in my next visit to Seoul.
184,5.0,"This district is very nice if you know where you're going, or if you have time to explore. It's not huge, but you might be disappointed. There is a famous street there, though, so make sure you see that one at least. The street goes uphill/downhill depending on where you are. Sometimes there are so many tourists there, so it might get a bit annoying. Bukchon is a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung palace (did I spell that right?). Also, sometimes people offer to let you inside one of their old houses there and give you a tour for a price. In my opinion, Bukchon is a must-see in Seoul. Not overwhelmingly fun, but just beautiful."
185,4.0,I absolutely loved wandering the winding ways around this neighborhood. Quaint and delightful. Fun to walk about exploring. Caution to be quiet and respectful--this is someone' home!
186,5.0,Nice walking around a traditional village with fantastic views over the city. Found many places you can rent the traditional clothing if you was with your wife so I would recommend this. Just respect locals by keeping the noise down as it is a residential area :)
187,3.0,Love this place and its old school houses and the quaint of the surrounding. Good for a late afternoon walk which I did - but suggest for you to go early in the morning if you prefer quieter moment with less of a crowd and people appearing in your pictures from time to time. If you don't mind people appearing in your pictures then you can go anytime. But just 1-2 hours in this place should suffice. It's quite a small area I feel. :)
188,4.0,Definitely pick up a map before you start that identifies the walking route. It's worth it. My highlight was when I stepped into the doll maker's house and was worth it to see her craft. I even bought three of her dolls since they were very reasonably priced. Every piece was unique.
189,5.0,A bit overloaded with tourists-nonetheless quaint! It really doesn't photograph well-not sure why! Lots of coffee shops(coffee v expensive in Korea & weekly American!) to laze in-often with no nibbles! And craft shops & workshops where you can drop in for an hour and play
190,4.0,"I did a self-guided walk, having picked up a may fro the local TI storefront.  It was an enjoyable afternoon and was a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of central Seoul."
191,4.0,Nice area in historical part of the city with old fashion/traditional style Korean houses. There is suppose to be several highlighted view points but streets looks very similar and i am still not sure if we actually found the right spots. Can be crowded with tourist (in this case just check the parallel streets).  Anyway it is worth to see it once you are next to the palaces. Btw it is not a museum and people are still leaving there.
192,4.0,"A collection of traditional hanok houses in one area.The nearest subway station is Anguk (line 3 orange line). My suggestion would be to plan visiting Insadong,Gyeongbokgung palace and Bukcoh all on the same day as they are all in the same area.Be prepared to walk a lot. Before you get to Bukchon, get an area map from the tourist information center ( the is one near the entrance of Insadong street, not far from the Anguk station). This map will show the side streets where most of the hanok houses are located.Mind you, some of them are on a steep hill.Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, otherwise you may not enjoy this at all.Always carry a bottle of water with you.If you are not a history buff and you have only limited days in Seoul, I would suggest that you can avoid the palaces and the Hanok village."
193,5.0,"You can serve Bukchon as an maze request game. First, head to the tourist information counter to take a full map of Bukchon. Then, started to fullfill the request to view all the 8 legendary scenes. After that, once you are successfully, reward yourself with a coffee at Sam cheong dong which is beside Bukchon. Perfect i should say!At the end i am sure you have explored Bukchon upside down! p/s: Scene 5 , 6 , 7 is crowded with a lot of people. It is harder to take a non people picture."
194,5.0,"It's really cool to be able to walk through a neighborhood straight from the Korean past. These old homes are preserved from before the modern age and show how the Koreans used to live before Western influences. At first, I was annoyed by all the older ladies walking around trying to keep everyone silent, but after seeing how some of the tourists acted there, I could see why. Remember, people actually live here so try to remain quite."
195,4.0,There's hardly anything much else to do. Lots of closed doors and security locks. Just make sure you have the legs for the rolling roads.
196,5.0,"Walking around this area of traditional Korean housing is simply delightful: it's well preserved and maintained. I thoroughly recommend getting off the main streets too as it's a lot less busy and there are little exhibitions, temples and shops to discover."
197,3.0,"Not quiet what I expected. The houses looked nice but that's about it really. Also didn't help that it can get very crowded being a tourist destination, making the whole experience a bit underwhelming. If you're close to the area then go for it but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
198,4.0,"Great area to wander around. Go off the main roads and get yourself lost a little, you'll easily find your way back. Plenty of cafés and places to eat. It's very popular, so be prepared for plenty of company, particularly at weekends. Lots of couples in traditional hanbok dress add to the atmosphere and the views of the old hanok houses against the background of high rise modern Seoul are fabulous.Walking out of Bukchon, you're only a stones throw from Insa-dong."
199,5.0,"The Hanok Village in Bukchon is Korean traditional houses. It is famous and one of must go to visit attractions in Korea. The Hanok Village is on the top of the mountain, so you need to walk a long and steap road. Although you will feel tired, it is worth when you arrived at the Hanok Village.  A lot of tourists dressed Korean traditional clothes – Hanbok, they took pictures in this beautiful places like a Korean. I am regret that I did not rent hanbok to try. It will a good experience. Also, I saw a foreign TV show came to there. They introduced the Hanok Village and interviewed the local resident to introduce the history of the village. Walking along this road, you found the air is fresh and the hanok is total different from each other. Each house have their feature and culture.  I really recommend this place to take a visit in Seoul. However, our voice should as low as possible. We should not disturb the local residents."
200,5.0,"Lovely village. You can't miss it.  Just wander around the winding streets that some times turn into sidewalks that can end up as stairs. Don't worry if you end up in a dead end, just turn around and find another path. Charming area with innumerable cafes and tea houses on the main street.  Do make sure you get off the main street, though."
201,4.0,"What I found interesting is, this village is located in the city, integrated with other element of the city. It is surprising when you walk in the pavement with a busy traffic and the next turn you take bring you to the traditional taste of Korean home.I learned that this area is visited by tourist massively, but I was there late afternoon so I only encounter 2-3 people, which is amazing. This is basically a residential area, so you should respect them and keep your voice low."
202,4.0,"If you want to see how korean traditional houses & village looks like, you visit here bukchon Hanok village. There are over 900 houses packed."
203,3.0,"The area of Seoul is lovely - and unique.  Most of Seoul is in the process off renovation and Bukchon still has some of the old feel to it. Jump into the alleys for proper food.  If someone is beckoning you into a hole in the wall sort of restaurant, go in.  You will be in the right place.  The pictures on the wall will assist you in choosing something to eat and you will love it.  Best food anywhere"
204,5.0,"You can choose to go with a tour or like me - walking free and easy! It is a great area full of hanoks (traditional korean houses), boutique shops and cafe. I was planning to spend half a day but turned out enjoyed for a good 5-6 hours walk with breaks in between. It was great to take a break with some ice tea and Korean snacks in a hanoks cafe.For photography lovers, you may take more than half a day like me. It was great walking round to take photos along small alleys, definitely a great trip! I enjoyed getting lost in the village although I had a map with me. For those who love to stay in old houses, there are lots of guest houses too For the cafe lover, absolutely a place to go with traditional atmosphere with some Korean tea and snacks.For those who go with tours, please lower your voice because this is still a residential area with residents. Unfortunately many tourists were still making lots of noises - even the tour guides were loud, not exactly respecting the residents. Tips: Please visit early and plan for your route if you want to avoid the crowds, I managed to avoid it.Also, you may want to bring/ purchase electronic fan if you travel during Summer like me."
205,4.0,"2 years ago, I tried to come here from Samcheongdong and omg it was so steep. This time I tried from Insadong/Anguk stn and it was so easy. Get out from exit2, wait for the green bus no.2 at the stop across the street from Starbucks and get off at 북촌한옥마을.돈미약국 (Bukchon Hanok Village/Donmi pharmacy) to save 10 mins of walking up the hill. From the stop, cross the street and just follow the crowd. From the photospot no. 4(if I remembered correctly) which is the observation point, you can walk down to Samcheongdong using steep staircase or the not too steep/far walkway. After that you can roam around the street. if you turn right you will shortly arrive at Kyeongbok Palace. If it's too much of a walk, after you reach the ground, just cross the street and take the bus to the palace or the main road for subway stn."
206,4.0,"If you are interested in getting ""lost"" in a folk area in Seoul, Bukchon Hanok village is a good chance to do it. You can see how a Korean village did look like, how the ceilings are/were made, the entrance doors of the houses and so on. I would recommend to visit the ""sample"" of old house shown in the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center."
207,5.0,"When you come to Seoul, Buchon Village is the little place that really traditional and if you love korean drama, this place is really like location for Korean Drama. But please do not make a noisy since this village still home for korean citizen."
208,5.0,Is near Sophia guesthouse I look around nice village town. A lot shops to look around. Night time is the best to shop around.
209,5.0,"The area is very cool.  Go to the main information centre first, they will give you a map with suggested routes.  It is best to follow the routes as determining the best route yourself could get tricky."
210,4.0,"Take the Orange Metro Line (3) and get off at Anguk Station. Take exit 3 and walk. You can access Insadong, Itaewon and Bukchon in the same visit. The National Museum is close, as are a few of the palaces. Keep in mind, this is a residential neighbourhood and people appreciate your silence."
211,5.0,"this is a must see/must wander through area in Seoul. Easiest to do it in conjunction with a tour to one of the two big palaces. Its a lovely district to wander through, some great coffee shops and also some lovely small boutique stores and jewellery shops. you feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle and some lovely photo opps."
212,5.0,I really enjoyed walking the streets. I entered up through the back up some narrow stairs and wound my way down the lanes heading in general direction of the Main Street. I walked there from G palace. Some beautiful old quiet streets of you wander off a little.
213,4.0,"Get your sneakers on as it's a hilly area, sometimes very steap too. Besides there many little shops for souvenirs but also tiny restaurants for a meal. Lots of hidden gems, take your time to discover them. Many hanoks to gaze at, however do respect the residents!"
214,4.0,"It is a very quirky place to be, lined both with modern shops and renovated traditional-style houses. It is essential to step into the alleyway offshoots and spend some time at an interesting cafe. Don't arrive until at least after 10 or 11am or else everything will be closed. Come in the afternoon for Bukchon at it's most lively and bustling."
215,4.0,It is a beautiful place to walk around and get a feel for the traditional houses and see with what care people take care of it and live in history. For me it was a good display that modern and old can live side by side without being out of balance. A minus can be that you have steep climbs. I went there with no expectations and what I saw was simply put beautiful.
216,4.0,"This neighborhood of streets and alleys are filled with hanoks, traditional-Korean houses, that either serve as personal residences, guesthouses for people to stay in, or shops.  I found the Bukchon Cultural Center one of the days and was able to make one of the art projects they had with a third-generation artisan.  She was so skilled and quick that I was thankful for her.  The urban explorer loved this, going down alleys to dead ends, turning around and having to go another way, happening upon a mural here, a cool coffee shop there, a lovely restaurant that served a bibimbap dish that was tasty, and so on...I'd go back to Seoul to explore this area more!"
217,5.0,"Loved the whole Bukchon area as it had several quirky cafes and shops mixed with traditional handicrafts, traditional houses (Hanok) and was such a mix mash of sights and sounds. There were many dressed up in the hanbok (Korean costume) to take photos also. Do climb (yes the slopes can get pretty steep here) to the vantage points for awesome views of the Seoul tower and mountains."
218,4.0,"I have lived in Asia for more than a decade and have traveled all over the region. To find such a well-preserved, clean, neat, tidy and interesting reconstructed ancient village is a delight. People do actually live in this village (lucky them!) so being quiet and respectful is a must. My local friend brought me here and we had many photo ops wandering the little streets and ducking into shops. I wish I had more time to experience this little gem.The shops sell items we foreigners really want, which is also a wonderful surprise. I was able to clean up in the souvenir department just in this one area.  Coffee shops and trinkets galore. Enjoy!"
219,5.0,"Beautiful architecture and great winding streets.  I visited Bukchon on a Saturday afternoon in April and it was very busy, but it was beautiful.  There are a lot of hills to walk so wear comfortable shoes.  This is a great location to see the traditional korean houses."
220,5.0,What a sensational place to visit best in Seoul. Old historical area of seoul. Not far from metro station. 6 stops Seoul station line 3. Fine local food in area.
221,3.0,"When u have done too much shopping, it would be nice to walk around here. Quiet Street and I am having some traditional Korean tea here."
222,5.0,"Give yourself a day to enjoy the many art galleries, shops, great eating and beautiful old village of Bukchon. The architecture is a stunning mix of old and new. A beautiful heritage area worth the protection it has been afforded. Heaps of tourists there so don't be surprised by the request from residents to not step in their doorsteps and for silence when you're looking around."
223,5.0,"For backpackers or any travellers who visit Seoul, I very recommended this place. If you love to take a walk by foot there are many to explore in this area. Take subway and stop in Anguk Station, at first you can cross or shopping for souvenirs in Insadong the just walk by foot about 5-10 minutes to Bukchon if you go directly but I bet you will stop couple of times because on your way to Bukchon you will see some interesting art galleries, museums, or old churces. From top of Bukchon, you can see the city view. You can take a rest and have some coffee or liquor and enjoy the fresh air. You can request free tour (check in internet, many volunteers offer free guide) or like me, I just like to explore by myself."
224,3.0,"Little 'fashionable' shops and where the trendy young people of seoul like to flock, but expensive by local standards. It has a nice feel and interesting little boutiques and cafes"
225,5.0,Enjoyed walking around and seeing great history! There are a million photo opportunities and a shop and restaurant that caters to anyone.
226,4.0,"I went here in the evening, but I wish I'd arrived even an hour earlier, to see more of the nearby shops open. It's a lovely section, but quiet--this is not the place to bring kids to roam the streets. Duck into any one of the tea or coffee houses nearby and enjoy great people watching as well. Well worth a detour in your itinerary to wander through."
227,5.0,"It's a residential area so please keep quiet whilst visiting! Go grab a map at the tourist information desk and follow the route, went during dawn and got to see sunset among the way. Stunning!"
228,5.0,"I would suggest for anyone to get a tour (one of those free walking tours), and let them bring you around the village. I had an awesome 2 hours walking around, taking pictures, listening to the history and taking in the beautiful surrounding. At the end of the tour, you will most definitely have a workout... as they have quite steep hills on certain streets, and the village in general is on a hilly area."
229,3.0,"a nice look into the living standards in Seoul 500 years ago, however the renovation is demonstrated and does not contribute to the authentic spirit of this place. good preserved, sometimes overcowded"
230,5.0,"This place is amazing! So glad I decided to come here. After coming out from the subway, I go straight to the tourist center to get a map of this area. There was a suggested route which lead us to some buildings/ houses with history. The route was beautiful and is like in the old movie. Sometimes there will be people wearing hanbook passing by and made this feeling of unreal stronger. Along the way we get to visit nice shops, craft shops and nice cafe. I bumped into a cultural shop where after paying 10000 won, I get to wear hanbook for one hour. Such an amazing experience! The end of the route brought us to ChangDeGung. Really enjoy the whole experience and would come back here again."
231,5.0,I just walked from my hotel to that place. It's lovely to walk around and see how people live ans shop in Bukchon. It wasn't sunny when I was there but it was really great!
232,3.0,"I loved this place because it's very artistic and you could take a lot of pictures, you will also fall in love with those old buildings."
233,2.0,"Some nice old wooden houses, but too touristy for me. All houses where fenced so not much to see for me. I would skip this if you have just one  day."
234,4.0,Lots of traditional houses as well as nice contemporary architecture around the area. It definitely deserves a visit.
235,5.0,bylanes of the old crisscross with the touristy and this up and down long walk deserves both aimless strolling and a useful local walking tour to catch what you may have missed in terms of vantage points and historical value.
236,4.0,"The Hanok houses are all very well preserved, pleasant walk with really steep slopes at some parts. I feel really bad for the people living there, even though there were lots of signs reminding people to keep their volume down, some groups are still very noisy. Please be considerate!"
237,4.0,"Nice old buildings. Many of them now functioning as guesthouses, galleries, cafés etc. Quaint charm."
238,4.0,"It's a great place to go for a stroll, but just be weary that there are plenty of hills in the area to get to a nice view point"
239,4.0,Very nice to see the different houses and styles and craftsmanship. Seems like a very expensive neighborhood nowadays. Lots of embassies in the neighborhood. Walking distance from the great palace . Nice places to have coffee and/or lunch.
240,3.0,"If it is hot, there is not a lot of places for shade. There are a lot of places to eat and souvenir shops which is convenient. However the Chinese tour groups are very noisy and distracting. It's a nice area to walk around but try not to go in the middle of the day when it's hot."
241,4.0,Nice peaceful village.A must if visiting seoul to see the experience the traditional culture of Korea.
242,3.0,"I went here for the old traditional house but the place did not really match my expectation.Yes, there are houses, but it does look that old. It is a hilly walk up so may be i havent walk far enough to see the good thing."
243,4.0,This neighborhood has the last of the original houses of Korea. I found it fascinating as much of Seoul has high-rises and modern buildings. It's residential mixed with retail. Lovely homes provide insight into the history of Korea. Don't miss the smaller family-run shops and restaurants intertwined with the homes.
244,4.0,"This neighborhood is very pleasant. Nice views, old houses, nice coffees and small museums or shops everywhere. Very different from the rest of the city. No longer very authentic though but still a good idea  for spending a couple of hours"
245,5.0,"go early in the morning to miss the tourists. Beautiful buildings, gardens and architecture, wonder enough and you'll get a good view of seoul and find a street full of street food for a snack before moving onto the next location."
246,5.0,I'm not one for shopping so I can't comment on the many boutiques dotted around. However the setting is perfect for strolling around. If you pop into a tourist information office (easy to find) they can provide you with a map with an easy to follow walking route through some of the more beautiful areas. Besides the buildings there are also some good views of the nearby vistas. This is a good place for photos.
247,4.0,"This is a great place to stroll around and see some traditional Korean architecture. But get here early to avoid the crowds, especially if, like me, you want to take photos of the buildings without hordes of people in them."
248,4.0,To find this island of tradition in the middle of an exploding Seoul was a nice experieince. The wooden houses that once were all over Korea can still be seen here in this living museum.
249,2.0,"This is a small residential area full of small, traditional Korean houses. Basically, you follow a stone path up some alleyways past some doors of about 100 small houses. Then, the path ends and you're back on normal Seoul city streets. Not much to see here."
250,3.0,"It's a residential area made of preserved hanok homes. There is a tourist strip along the main street, and a few renovated homes as cheap museums/arts centers, but other than that it really is a neighborhood. Nice, quiet, and quaint. But not somewhere I'd seek out again."
251,4.0,"Very interesting to check out the old town from Joseon Dynasty.  Buk chon (North Town) is village with old Koreab traditional houses built around in 1930s.  In Bukchon village, there are 8 different spots to check out different views to enjoy the old town."
252,5.0,"Part if the world heritage .. The houses are scattered, will have to talk little and get lose often but it's enjoyable experience after all"
253,4.0,"I was staying in Anguk for business and had a few hours to spare. I was recommended the Bukchon village and was not disappointed! Very quaint, older Korean buildings in a traditional style. Really enjoyed this little 2 hour stroll around..."
254,4.0,An area full of traditional Korean houses which have been well maintained.  Make sure you wear good walking shoes as it is very steep.
255,5.0,This place there are a couple of traditional houses kept. Have to walk inside the smaller lanes. However this is still occupied by the local residents so can't go in and visit it. However if wanted to experience the traditional houses there are a couple of guesthouse. Can visit one of the high school located uphill. What a nice atmosphere to study in the school.
256,5.0,"Seoul is busy, lack of quiet places for your own time. This is the right place. Lots of great architectures and streets with foreigners allow you to be your own."
257,5.0,This hanok village reminds me of the hutons in Beijing I love the way there is such a relatively big area so well preserve and alive (people live in the centuries old houses) in a quite impersonal city as Seoul. Definitely worth visiting and having a traditional tea in our of the amazing tea houses
258,4.0,"Lovely traditional Korean homes. Wonderful to wander (and get lost) around the tiny lanes. Lots of photo taking opportunities. Bukchon is growing in popularity, which means that more and more tourists are heading here. Wish they would respect the residents’ privacy and keep noise levels down. It would also make for a more tranquil experience as they explore this lovely traditional neighborhood."
259,5.0,"This is a nice area to explore in conjunction with the visit of some of Seoul's palaces. Perhaps not quite as nice as Insadong though to find good food, but plenty of little restaurants nonetheless. It is often very crowded though, so don't expect a quiet traditional Korean village, at least on the week-end."
260,5.0,"In the whole city during my time ther i found myself at everytime walking to here, it is because it's a calm neighberhood, old houses and the smell of wood, don't forget to get this Guide from the Tourist Information and Go to all the mention Spots, you will get the best Shots everDo it in the morning you will be alone there and perfect for shooting, the afternoon gets busy again Enjoy it"
261,5.0,"Bukchon and Samcheon are in the same neighborhood and are worth a trolley about (but not in the snow since some roads are steep). You needn't follow any particular route. I have been many a time and I am still pleasantly surprised by some of the little alleyway treasures. Also very near Changdeokgung Palace, so a good combo. Get off at Anguk Station exit 2"
262,5.0,Avoid the crowds while not getting in the way of those living in these wonderful homes. The architecture of these old homes is most impressive.
263,4.0,It was nice to see old houses and this village was able to preserved their houses. This is a residential area but they allow the public to roam around and have their pictures taken with the traditional houses as their background. But be mindful with noises as the residents do not like to be disturbed.There's no fee when you visit the village and it is just 40 minutes walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace and few kilometers away to Insadong Market. Don't mind the long walk as the place is very nice for walking. Just enjoy the scenery and the culture that the Koreans has to offer.There is also a shop allowing the visitors to try the traditional Korean costume with a fee at the Bukchon village.
264,4.0,"After visiting all city palaces don't miss this historical neigbourhood.Good for strolling in galeries, arts, shops, restaurants in the heart of Seoul.No visit to Seoul is complete without this place.Spend here some hours starting early morning and having you lunch as well."
265,4.0,"watching sunset here is one of the most memorable time for me in Korea. sitting in R coffee shop (near the edge of the hill) and had a very nice, heartwarming conversation with So Young-the lovely shop owner. her tea is so good and she boils it 3 times for me :)"

267,4.0,The whole neighborhood consist of traditional korean houses or hanok. There are volunteer that gave us map showing several location that is the best spot to took pictures. The area is very quiet and calm. Very relaxing
268,5.0,"This place is awesome. If you want to see how old korean house style, you can come here.The architecture is awesome. This place is famous place for korean drama shooting."
269,5.0,"Bukchon area, especially the Hanok Village is a must-visit place IMO. You can walk around, sightseeing, and if you have the map, you can seek for the recommended photo spots and take some insta-worthy shots! Do mind that LOTS of walking is involved and the area does get crowded at times. And because the hanok(s) are private properties and people actually live there, we are not suppose to visit after 6pm, if I remember correctly :)"
270,4.0,"I spent a pleasant few hours wandering around here. While the traditional houses are interesting, I was happy just soaking in the local flavour and enjoying the delicious street food. Gets quite crowded late afternoons on the weekends."
271,3.0,"Its history is 600 years long, but the area is so well-preserved and so full of tourists, art shops and guest houses etc. that it felt like a very nice walk in the Korean version of Disneyland."
272,1.0,"Really?  What's the big deal? Yes, you can see the glimpse of old neighbor hood, but it really didn't do it for me.I definately would not recommend people, i'd rather visit one of the palaces."
273,4.0,I've always wanted to see the various styles and it was quite quiet when I visited. The views are also good from the vantage points. Unfortunately I wasn't able to look inside a house but they looked really quaint from the outside.
274,4.0,"The two best pieces of advice in visiting Bukchon are:  Ignore many of the “recommended walk routes” you find, particularly in guide books.  They would be better called “If you walk in and around this general perimeter we’ve laid out, you’ll see Bukchon”.  Go to the “Images” option of most search engines and type in “Bukchon”, you’ll find alternative, much more detailed (and perhaps better) walking route maps.  Get an early start (getting to Bukchon by 8:00 – 8:30 A.M. is recommended).  The area is surprisingly small and the streets very narrow.  By 10:00, it’ll start to fill up with mini tour groups and other tourists with cameras to the point that any pictures you take will be mostly of other people taking pictures.  This is especially true for the north-west section of Bukchon.  [If it’s just you and the occasional resident walking their dog or walking to school, you’ll know you’re there at the right time].  If you’re staying close by, it might be a good idea to visit it until crowds start to show up, then leave and pick up where you left of the next day.Finally, not to be preachy but keep in mind that you are, for all intents and purposes, in these people’s front and back yards."
275,5.0,Bukchon Village was truly incredible and I was able to experience what life used to be years ago. As you visit you're required to speak on a minimal tone of voice to not disturb the people living in the area. Within the village you will be able to find souvenirs made by the locals.
276,5.0,although it is a distance (around 1km) from subway and need to walk uphill. It is worth to go there and walk around so you can see the old style houses and feel the culture. scenery up there is nice which you can see folk museum from top view.
277,4.0,"Loving this place! Not just the traditional houses, the surrounding area is such a lovely place to visit. I wished that I had stayed in one of the traditional hanok guest houses here, it would have been a good experience."
278,5.0,Found a free walking tour and went with a very nice lady guide. She showed us all the interesting spots. A nice tour for sure
279,2.0,I was really excited before going but in reality it's just modern versions of old houses in a residential area.  Some good cafes and shops in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to go there (I was staying near by).
280,5.0,This old city is amazing nice.....many old buildings with many very nice shops and galleries everywhere
281,3.0,"A steep and winding road up a hill. The buildings are old, but only 100 or so years. Gives a bit of an insight about traditional homes, but crowded with tourists and a little over rated."
282,3.0,It is fun to walk around the area. Especially the little craft shops inside or the small cafe's. It is close to the palace!
283,3.0,"This is a nice area to walk through if you have time. Except for one house open to tourists, the rest seem to be private homes which seem to be nice but of which tourists can only have a peek through fences."
284,5.0,"Cozy houses show the old times of Seoul. Impressive views of the city and you can appreciate the contrast between old Seoul and Modern Seoul. Be prepared to walk, since there are many steep streets."

286,4.0,"This was a really nice place to stroll. There is a tourism office that provides maps and the buildings are lovely to take it. There are shops, boutiques and cafes all along the way to make the walk more interesting.Be sure to stop at the craft center - it is a fun diversion!"
287,4.0,Get a feel for a traditional Korean village and home.  Narrow streets and alleys so it's easier to walk than drive.  Stay in a hanok to get a real flavor of Korean tradition.  Great breakfasts!
288,5.0,"This large area is suitable for slow strolls and lots of picture taking.  Make sure to get a pamphlet with the 10? views of Bukchon and get the cameras ready.  You can see many traditional styled buildings and alleys.  Many of the hanoks can be rented as a house stay for a reasonable price. There are many hanoks converted to restaurants, tea houses, museums, etc...  The wall through the views are very hilly.  Don't do it in a hot day.  At places up high, you can see good views of the surrounding areas and mountains."
289,4.0,"different style of the traditional korean house are right here. but you have to walk up and down to see all different house, sport shoes is better"
290,4.0,"Bukchon Village with winding streets, traditional building, shops and restaurants is a nice place to spend couple of hours wondering around. If you have an extra time it is worth seeing."

293,4.0,"Explored around the traditional Bukchon Hanok homes area today. The area is surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine,and is home to hundreds of traditional houses that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Very colorful neighborhoods and many of these hanoks operate as coffee shops, cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses. After exiting the subway at anjuk, just  look for the Hyundai HQ and head up the hill. So much to see."
294,5.0,"Good place for walking, sightseeing and shooting photo. Near anguk station, can spend a lot of time there then visit the Gyeongbokgung palace."
