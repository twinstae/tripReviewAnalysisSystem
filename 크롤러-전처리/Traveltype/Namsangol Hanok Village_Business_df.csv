0,5.0,I didn't have high expectations as I went to Bukchon Hanok Village before; so reckon it'll be similar ie cafes housed in traditional houses etc. But at Namsangol Hanok Village (NHV) surprises me at every turn. First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village. We also came across a gentleman who is a falconer and told us many information on this ancient heritage of korean falconry. The cafe nestled in the middle of the village is also very quaint and the souvenirs are worth looking at.

2,5.0,Beautiful partly reconstructed ancient village showing the way of living centuries ago.Very interesting vor historically interested people
3,4.0,good walking streets.  Preserved the tradition.close to the palace.  It is very nice walking in to this place and taking pictures in the traditional attire
4,2.0,"If you have time and want to see some traditional houses, then I suggest to visit the Bukchon village and not this sort of reconstruction which is only a turist attraction. The only positive thing is a park inside where families and children could play together in open air space."
5,5.0,A short walk from the Chungmuro subway stop on the #3 line. Take the #3 exit from the station.This is a collection of historic buildings many of which were moved from their original locations. Spent half a day enjoying the Village and the grounds.
6,5.0,To have a look at the traditional Koran architecture it is recommended to visit Namsangol Hanok village and enjoy in peace a stroll through nicely lined houses and a park.
7,4.0,The background was really great for photos and it was interesting to see how the Koreans lived long time ago.
8,4.0,"Are you interested of traditional Korean houses and performance? You can experience traditional houses, traditional performance in a city for free! Taekwondo experience program for foreigners is held at 11 a.m., 2 p.m., and 5 p.m. on Wednesday and Saturday every week, and if you visit the village on weekend when the wedding reenactment is taking place, you can watch it."
9,4.0,Always love to look back to times that can still be vividly remembered for some of the older people of the Peninsula. Sometimes the traditions of the past are too easily swallowed up by the thrusting assertion of the modern. Well worth a visit.
