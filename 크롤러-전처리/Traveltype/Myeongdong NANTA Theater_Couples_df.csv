0,5.0,The show is very nice. The best part of the show is on the interaction between the performer and audience. Highly recommended to watch it.
1,5.0,"Performance was powerful, beautiful, fun and really enjoyable for my wife and I.  We booked the VIP seats located in the middle of the lower section (Row I) and had a Central view in seats 7 and 8. No Korean was required to enjoy the show. We spent a bit of time trying to find the building in the middle of the busy Myeongdong shopping street, and got some help from the tourist information folks who walk around."
2,4.0,"Entertaining and great performance. My husband and I enjoyed the show! If your time are more flexible, go for the non-peak hour show for good discounted rates.. We got 50% off for VIP seating zone."
3,5.0,It was my partnerâ€™s first time at a play and she thoroughly enjoyed herself. We spent 90% of the time laughing. It was one of the highlights of our Korea trip!

7,5.0,Really good fun with audience participation and lots of laughs from everyone at the show. Would recommend to anyone going to Seoul
8,5.0,"We had a great time watching Nanta.  It is a live, mostly non-verbal show that includes real knives and flames.  The percussion and theatrics were very entertaining.  My husband was selected from the audience to participate.  He was a good sport and would normally not volunteer.  He had a great time and now we have this wonderful memory.  Worth the time and cost of admission."
9,5.0,I went there with my boyfriend on his birthday. We would highly recommend the show for both adults and children.
10,2.0,"The show was ok, but not at all worth the money. Maybe itâ€™s better in  other places or with other actresses as it is so famous."
11,5.0,Fun story line - told through slap-stick humor and music.  Similar to a Blue Man Group type of show.  Safe for all ages - great fun!
12,5.0,"The show is Super entertaining and exciting , recommended to go, one of the best show I watched ...."
13,5.0,"So entertaining, I could not stop laughing and I loved the interaction with the audience. If you are visiting Seoul you have to go and to NANTA Theatre!"
14,5.0,Absolutely fantastic hilarious amazing show.. Nothing negative to say about it. Go see it go see it! Five stars âœ¨ actors are sooooo talented!
15,5.0,Went to the show expecting it to be silly. Well it is but in a really well way. I thoroughly enjoyed it and even got to play a bit in it after being randomly selected in the audience. It was fine and they were really great on stage and made me feel at easy. Was great fun and would recommend it to anyone to go watch :)
16,4.0,"Great way to spend an evening in Seoul. Funny, energetic, and understandable whatever language you speak.Note: the theatre if on the 2nd floor of the building so a bit tough to spot."
17,5.0,"Fun, exciting, exhilarating, amazing in so many ways. Brilliant show, worth a visit. Itâ€™s hilarious, interactive and so much fun!"
18,5.0,Laughed for the entire show. So good. Couldnâ€™t recommend it more. Definitely a must. Perfect for everyone.
19,4.0,We went to the NANTA show in Myeongdong.  It was a cooking themed theatre production where a team of chefs at a restaurant are given a large wedding dinner order to make on short notice.  So they hurriedly try to fulfill it.  Itâ€™s supposed to be a comedy.It was fun and funny at times.  Thereâ€™s minimal speaking in it so it works if you speak Korean or you donâ€™t.  We enjoyed it and itâ€™s not too expensive so worth a try if you want to break from shopping in Myeongdong.
20,4.0,"I guess, this is a must do when you are in Seoul. Good family fun and well choreographed show that will definitely entertain."
21,5.0,"My wife and I were selected to participate, and we received commemorative photos to treasures our memories of the experience. Simply an amazing production and amazing cast. I wish you guys come back to the UK again as I wish to bring my friends along."
22,5.0,"A different kind of theater experience! A must do in seoul!!Very funny!! Great for kids too!! Small theater, you can sit anywhere and have a great view!"
23,5.0,This is a very entertaining show and I find this worth every cent I paid. The actors and actress are very professional and their performance really made my evening an enjoying and memorable one!Highly recommended !!!
24,4.0,It was an entertaining show for first timers to Korea... sometimes you don't need words to put on a good show.
25,5.0,"Me and my wife decided to stay in Myeongdong area of Seoul because Nanta is on top of my list to see in Seoul, and oh boy they did not disappoint. If Boston has the Blueman Group, Seoul has Nanta. It is very original, and so hilarious. I never realized that the kitchen and several techniques of food preparation can become a hit show and you could die laughing watching it...they even have a school for it, you need to be a Nanta school certified before they will allow you to perform. I hope the can tour around USA someday... I want to watch it again!"
26,5.0,Booked it online via their official website to see better discounts. No need to queue in line since it was pre-booked and paid. It was a good show even for foreigners! It was funny and a bit interactive especially for those in the front. The location was easy to go to since it's in the middle of the shopping areas.
27,5.0,Great performers who created a real fun experience for all ages! One of the highlights of our visit to Seoul.
28,4.0,Very entertaining! Enjoy the Rhythm of the percussion. The performance was very unique. We also like the dance and music.
29,5.0,Went with my 84 year old aunt and she really enjoyed the show.  She said she's never laughed so much.  The show is nonverbal so there is no language barrier.  Very interactive and entertaining.  Highly recommend and hope to see again with husband next visit to SKorea.
30,1.0,"Not funny, poorly executed, excruciating audience participation section. Itâ€™s not cheap but does allow you to sit down for 90 mins. Kids seemed to like it. Maybe we had high expectations?"
31,5.0,Don't miss the chance to see the show when in korea.Entertaining with surprise element towards the end - keep a lookout!
32,5.0,"The NANTA show is a must-see while in Seoul! The high energy and hilarious performance by the four chefs and manager far exceeded my expectations. Do not fret if you do not speak Korean: the show is mostly non-verbal so everyone can understand, although it does include some English punch lines too. Be prepared for some flying props! It was thoroughly entertaining and original. Much respect to the performers who clearly give their all each performance. I have been thinking about this show a lot since I have seen it and have recommended it to many of my visiting friends. I hope NANTA continues its successful track record as the longest running show in Seoul!P.S. The VIP tickets up front are worth it."
33,5.0,"Nanta performance is a not to be missed performance in Seoul, South Korea.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed watching, so funny and entertaining."
34,5.0,"A great mix of impressive performances (acrobatics, object manipulation, unconventional musical instruments, and much more) and easy-going well-delivered humor which should entertain you from start to finish regardless of age. I recommend this show for anyone visiting Seoul, unless you are very short on time and dead set on prioritizing more historical culture.A few words of basic English are used for instructions in the audience interactive parts, but the show is otherwise completely language independent. The room is quite small, which means that all the seats seemed to offer a decent view, but beware that you might get dragged up on the stage if you sit too close..."
35,5.0,Well worth your time to see.  Very entertaining and funny with lots of audience participation.  Just be mindful that its located on the 3rd or 4th floor of a building so dont think you are lost when using your navigator and it says you've arrived but you dont see it.  Look up! ðŸ˜Ž
36,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went on a Monday night. The Nanta show was a lighthearted and fun production to watch after grabbing dinner nearby (there is no food provided in this show despite it being the focus of the show, although there is a cafe in the lobby). The crew makes quite an impressive percussion and acrobatics performance out of common kitchen items. The audience seemed to be mostly other local tourists. I would recommend this show in the evening to families and others looking for a laugh, but not to those seeking a cultural experience."
37,5.0,"I have booked this through KLOOK after seeing before during my lone last visit two years ago. But this time I wanted to share with my wife. She had some scepticism. No response from her after the show started for about 10 minutes. I was glad that she finally started to enjoy the show. After the show, she said this has been the most fun and enjoyable show she has ever been to - but no photo to share during the show :=)"
38,4.0,an interesting and interactive show.  Suitable for all ages.  Advance booking online will help you save lots of money.  Also the show is quite full and so advance booking is highly recommended.  The location of the shop is on the 2/F of a commercial building and may be missed if you just look around casually.  Watch out for the Innisfree Shop on the ground level.
39,5.0,"The show is definitely worth the price. Highly recommended. But the theater is hard to find, suggests to show up early."
40,5.0,"Really fun and well done show! Even my husband, who typically doesnt love live theater,  really enjoyed it! Great cast, high energy! Super fun!"
41,5.0,"It's just the funniest show, transcends barriers of language and culture.What went well:1. Very good actors 2. Immense amount of audience interaction3. Great sound effectsTop tips:1. Sit in the front to appreciate the actors' expressions.2. We got lost on the way there, it's on a crossroad off Myeongdong main street . No need to follow google maps and go to the end of the street."
42,5.0,"We has a wonderful time at the NANTA show! Full of surprises, fantastic cast that interacts with the audience. Not to be missed!"
43,5.0,Would recommend everyone to attend this if you are in the area. You can sit anywhere as the place is not that big but sit in the center for a better view. You can sit at the side if you wanna have a chance to take part of the show as they will grab audience.
44,4.0,"The Nanta theatre is a fun high energy show for the whole family. We enjoyed the Saturday Matinee. If you like mild acrobatics and alternative drum music, it is amazing."
45,5.0,"It's a great fun show, you don't need to understand Korean. Theatre is small and near Myeongdong Market with excellent street food. We went to an evening performance."
46,5.0,"A great taste of Korean humour, 100% worth seeing! The performers are extremely talented! Myeongdong is a must visit area, go shopping, try the streetfood and go to this show. Perfect evening in Seoul."
47,5.0,"In one week. Yup. TWICE! This show has everything. Music, dance, action, comedy, and even magic! And it was just a major plus that there was some shirtless/ abs action thrown in the mix as well. LOVE THIS SHOW! Will watch it aagain!!!"
48,5.0,"My husband and I were in Seoul for a couple of days and a colleague of mine recommended going to see the Nanta show. I was expecting the show to be pretty cheesey but I was surprised at how much fun I had. Neither of us understand Korean but you don't need to in order to enjoy the performance. The actors are brilliant! Not only are they expressive in their faces/movements but they are talented musicians as well. If you're visiting South Korea and you can get to one of the theatres, make sure you go!"
49,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed this slapstick comedy, action packed, high energy and very easy to understand, even though one may not understand a single word of Korean. There is audience participation, thus you are engaged through the show.Went to the Myeongdong venue, which was easy to locate. Comfortable sized theatre. We bought the VIP seats, and these gave us a comfortable view of the Show."
50,3.0,"Humor is a personal thing -- what might be hilarious to one person might be so-so to another. The Nanta Show is basically slapstick comedy, with some drumming and mediocre acrobatics thrown in (lots of food cutting, throwing around). It was evident that most of the audience members enjoyed this show -- but it wasn't my thing. I guess I was the adult at the middle-school cafeteria when raucious students are having a food fight.Best to order online in advance to get discounted seats -- and the cheaper the seats the better as all seats have a good vantage of the stage. However, the more expensive seats in the bottom floor will get food thrown at them, and audience members might be called onto the stage for participation.Beware of Google maps for finding the place, since Google maps for Seoul still need some development compared to other world cities. Find attached a map of Myeong Dong, and the Nanta Theater is located in the Unesco building, coordinates C-3, at the corner of MyeongDong-gil and MyeongDong 4-gil"
51,5.0,"I'm not normally a fan of things like musicals or dance, so was a little unsure about a musical cooking show.  However, Nanta is none of these things, its incredibly well coreographed, engaging, clever and fun. It exceeded my expectations completely and was a thoroughly enjoyable show and a proved to be a couple of hours well spent. You can easily follow the story as there is no language barrier. Definitely worth booking tickets for!"
52,5.0,"Photos are not allowed during the performance, so I didnâ€™t take any. I bought Premium seat tickets because it was a last minute decision to watch this show on the same day, and it turned out itâ€™s a great decision! Honestly the ticket is quite affordable, comparing with Broadway in NYC or West end in London, so if your budget allows, just get the premium one. If you are looking for the chances to get picked up to interact with the performers, you may try your luck with some seats closer to the aisle. Overall the show is creative and definitely not easy for the performers! They have to present an entertaining and dramatic effect and keep highly energetic at all times. I can tell they put effort in tapping into Chinese-speaking audienceâ€™s attention by saying some Chinese words in between. In short, itâ€™s a good 90-min show to watch in Seoul."
53,3.0,"Nanta seems like a Korean institution, and with all the incredible reviews, our expectations were super high.The show is full of energy and fun, but donâ€™t expect a West End style performance or anything coherent! It was super silly, fun, but in places not that great. We got the cheapest tickets and the view was still great upstairs, so I would recommend going for those. Still worth a watch, just perhaps lower your expectations!"
54,4.0,"Nanta show is an excellent show if you like drums and you want to let lose.5 artists on stage keep you entertained while drumming on pans, pots,...and using knives and others sticks...A very straight forward humor lasting 90mns. Excellent for all audience."
55,5.0,"Uncomplicated fun and entertainment.  Standard, long-running show ( for years) that is successful, both as a standard targeting a tourist audience, and as a popular draw for local, Korean audiences.   A very loose story line that , in itself, is not important.  But it serves to bring together a fun mix of music and comedy, that focuses on a unique style of percussion, in which the players use a varity of knives, foods, chopping blocks and kitchen equipment to display some amazing percussuon skills and some gymnastic style abilities.   Wrapped in comedic skill that features mostly physical situations and punchlines.   Really fun show.  Talented performers."
56,5.0,Very entertaining and you would like to see more. Thumbs up.Located level 3 UNESCO building not Myeongdong theatre. Highly recommended for anyone and any age.
57,5.0,"Very entertaining show, creative, energetic. I was dragged in their show, and we love it. Thank you nanta show . Must watch show when you go to korea"
58,3.0,"Funny show with talented cast members. The show is non verbal, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t speak Korean. It isnâ€™t a must when youâ€™re in Seoul, but would definitely recommend this if youâ€™re traveling with young children."
59,4.0,"+slapstick comedy but entertaining. the characters are so cute and kpop! easy redemption of ticket vouchers bought from klook! -seats are cramped and the theater was a little difficult to find. traveller tips: it is not the 'myeongdong theater', look for the 'nanta theater' instead, about 100m to the left of myeongdong theater when you're facing it. Have coffee and biscuits at the nanta cafe while waiting for the show to start!"
60,3.0,"First off, this is my personal opinion on the show (don't mean for any misunderstandings or hate) To start off, I bought VIP seats for the Nanta show, after reading the amazing reviews and feedbacks from others. I went in expectedly (maybe I put too much expectation on the show in the first place) but came out not entirely satisfied with my experience. The Nanta show is basically a 100 minutes show filled with comedic acts, real cooking at some scenes and dancing/drum playing. I was not impressed with the dance skills or choreography (it was not synchronised or on point), nor was I entirely impressed with the comedic acts and scenes (some parts in the beginning was funny but the humour died down- or rather become awkward and repetitive after the first 30 mins of so). Some reviews said it was comparable to Storm the Musical but in Korean version. This was not at all true, if anything, it was probably a knock-off from Storm the Musical. I went with a friend and to be honest, it got quite draggy and for the first time in a staged show I was checking the time to see when will it be over. The storyline was alright, but predictable. Actors were alright as well, they were in their character (but I wasn't too sure what character they were trying to potray) - it was comedic then serious then foolish then etc. My personal experience was not at all like the rest of reviews unfortunately. Maybe if I had bought the cheapest ticket, it wouldn't have been such a terrible experience. Who knows?Take note of all the reviews before you decide on this show! *some extra points - 1. there is guest participation involved during the show - sitting by the edge grants you a better chance but it depends on who the actors decide to choose (it's luck really)2. they also have some guests interaction at some short scenes which I thought was good.3. no photography or videography throughout the whole show 4. call in advance for reservation of ticket or go to the theatre straight to purchase (but only available for purchase on that day itself)Hope you guys have a better experience than me! :)"
61,4.0,"I enjoyed the performance - even though the comedy is slapstick, the energy and rhythm was good. Plus, you don't need to speak Korean to understand the show!We picked the cheapest tickets (about  $40AUD) with seats up the back but still had a good view.Nice little break from the hustle and bustle of the shopping district."
62,5.0,"From the begging to the end of the show we had so much fun, it was just hilarious and the actors made an incredible performance. The show is a mix of acting, music, dance, circus skills...everything perfectly synchronize in a kitchen as a main space. There is almost no dialogue because the public is very different (Corean, Chinese, Japanese and Westerns) so they just use a few words when need it. They picked up my boyfriend to make a little performance at the stage so it was extra funny!I recommend it 100% and I would come back for sure if I travel to Korea again!"
63,5.0,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this show. The cast was talented and energetic and entertaining. Our money was well spent! I agree with a previous reviewer (Ccandynz) that, because the theater was small and intimate, no need to sit in the most expensive section."
64,3.0,"Lots of people, especially young people... means fun! I rarely see a place so crowded. There are clothing and souvenir for sales, talented spray painters performing live painting that awes the audience, there are cafes, restaurants, street stage performances (singing), 3-D art gallery, etc. It could be a fun place for young people."
