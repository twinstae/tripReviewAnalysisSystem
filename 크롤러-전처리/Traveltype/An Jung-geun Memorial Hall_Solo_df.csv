0,5.0,"This is the memorial hall for An Junggeun who assassinated Japanese governor.They seemed to try hard to attract visitors with various methods. I think you'll have a wonderful time in this tiny hall.Location:This hall is locating between Baekbeom Park and Namsan Library. Close from the southern trail entrance of Namsan which is also the bus route.The entrance of the building is a bit tricky. Visitors have to circle around from the front wall to the gate.- 30 ~ 60 min to watch slowly.- The location is not on the point where many people pass. This is mostly not crowded.- There is a garden of rocks before the building. It's also nice area to relax watching scripts on them.- During cherry blossom season, I recommend accessing from drive-in way of Namsan Library. There are beautiful cherry blossoms and it's good to walk."
