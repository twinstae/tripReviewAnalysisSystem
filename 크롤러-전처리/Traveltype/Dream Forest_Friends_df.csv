0,5.0,"It's amazing that few people talk about this place. It's a big park with a lot of grass, a hanok, a fountain, a museum for kids, a cafe, and the best part: an observation deck where you can get a great shot of Seoul. You can see all over Gangbuk and even see the Lotte Tower Building from a distance. The best thing about this place is that it's free! If you want to park here, it's â‚©300 every 10 minutes. I recommend this place highly especially for families or with your special someone."
