0,5.0,"Spent a couple of hours here. Interesting. Worth a visit, we visited it within a tour that we had booked."
1,5.0,one of the must see museums in my opinion.  they did a great job presenting the Korean war and its immediate aftermath.  the museum used to be a bit too much propaganda but they have make it more objective = gone are the famous pictures of the happy children of South Korea and
2,5.0,For more than 2 Millenia the museum is a detailed history of Korean and World History. Tragedy and triumph of the human spirit is on display for everyone to learn from. We really wish we had more time. 
3,5.0,"This is an absolute must visit if you have the remotest interest in the history of South Korea (and if you come here you should). Brilliantly laid out, highly informative and pits theit current psyche re defence in context. Deeply respectful of the nations that helped them as"
4,5.0,This is a must when visiting Seoul! We approached the front desk when arriving and asked for a audio guide in English but were instead offered a guided tour which was very pleasant. Our guide was Chenz who was very knowledgeable and friendly and offered a great deal of
5,5.0,"The memorial show cases the long Korean war and the exhibits tell the history of the two Korea's and the devastation brought about by the war.What is memorable is that despite the cold relations between the two countries, there is a longing for unity in the hearts of the citizens. These are well brought out by various sculptures on the lawns of the memorial. One very moving statue is is the 'Statue of brothers' where a South Korean Soldier hugs his younger brother who is serving  in the North Korean army, on the battle field. This statue is on top of a dome with a wide crack, which symbolises the separation of the two Korea's and the hope for unification. Fighter planes, tanks, artillery and naval weapons used in the Korean war are on display on the lawns of the memorial. A must visit if you are in Seoul"
6,5.0,"As you walk towards the entrance, seeing the names of every soldier who died in the Korean War was a somber reminder of the price for freedom.  The museum itself was well laid out and clean.  Full of history and a good memorial.Would recommend."
7,5.0,Visit if you are even a bit interested in learning about Korean history and specially about the 1950-53 Korean War. It's a beautiful monument and surely worth a couple of hours of your time. I was surprised to learn that an Indian medical contingent was in Korea during the war and that the Indian flag flies along with the Korean flag and the flags of all the countries that played a role in the war.
8,5.0,"We visited as part of a Seoul city tour and wish we could have returned to spend more time here. Emjoyed the bronze statues outside as part of the plaza. Wonderful displays inside. The memorial hall caused me to reflect deeply on the toll of human life that was lost. We sat in on an interactive presentation in a theater where the seats moved and we were right in the nose cone of a bomber plane, right on the landing beach, right in the middle of an air fight... Oh, my, so realistic and well done. Don't miss this!"
9,5.0,"The memorial is easy to get to by train, and it is very quiet and not crowded with tourists. There are many things to read and objects of history to see in their museum. If you like to visit museums and read about their historical timeline, and visit quiet places, this place is good. We did not get to finish walking the whole place as it was closing soon."
10,4.0,"This is a very tastefully done audio visual explanation of the history of South and North Korea.  The various rooms inform visitors of aspects of the war period and the U.N. and specifically, U. S.’s involvement.There is sufficient signage or videos for English-speaking visitors."
11,5.0,"This should be the top attraction in Seoul, an amazing museum with huge outdoor areas where you can board warships and get up close and personal to warplanes and tanks! A good place to understand Seoul’s history and the sacrifices made by many nations around the world."
12,5.0,"Many may not know exactly how South Korea became the country it is today or why there is so much tension with North Korea but this will explain a lot. There is the usual displays of military hardware but there is a very informative section on the Korean War and how things got to be where they are today. Check ahead to find out if there are performances on the huge parade square that showcase Korea’s traditional and modern army, it is colourful and interesting to watch. South Korea is a proud nation and this is worth taking time to see."
13,5.0,"This is a superb museum/memorial.Thought provoking, interesting, an excellent place to learn about the struggles Korea has faced as a nation over the years.Plenty of English labelling and the also have English speaking guided tours if you want one.Free entry & a must see whilst you’re in Seoul."
14,5.0,"Great day, some of the items were closed but it was still worth the visit. It's free! Lots to see. Very large spread area."
15,4.0,"If you like war museums, this is the place for you. I learned a lot and was quite impressed with the gratitude expressed to the 21 nations that contributed troops or support."
16,4.0,"On a rainy day museum was crowded, noisy kids running around. Worth to visit still, I learned a lot of Korean war history and felt nice how they remembered for example all UN partners in Korean war. Intresting how they linked modern technology with paintings and sculptures."
17,5.0,"Wasn’t too sure what to expect from this museum, but upon arrival we were blown away by how massive the place is. The museum was really large inside and out, with lots of exhibits to look at, interactive ones as well. A lot of in depth rich history and there’s even free English/Japanese walking tours (12pm and 2pm I believe). The admission to the museum is free and there’s 3 massive levels for you to experience."
18,4.0,"Attempting to find one's way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor (exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest, line 4 more difficult). The memorial itself, however, is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background."
19,4.0,"As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula. Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this. Well, there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it. If stressed for time, this is a miss."
20,5.0,If you plan on coming here then don’t be rushed! There is so much to see.We had to plan well as we were on a time limit.We visited the rooms about the Korean War which were really informative and interesting. The English is just fine. They have rooms on further back in history which we didn’t have time to visit.Absolutely huge building. There’s a cafe selling nice smoothies and a gift shop on sight. Outside is amazing too - loads of fighter planes and tanks and of course the super impressive war memorial statue.What a great place to be free as well.
21,5.0,"The outside memorials are, in my opinion, the best part of the whole thing. The statues and installations are very moving and well designed. Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together, and take you through each year of the war, the help received by various countries and the contexts of the war. My only critique would be that they seem to microscopically criticize the north in every facet, while never accepting or elaborating on any of the shortcomings the south may have had. In brief, a broader and less biased history would have helped to understand the nuances of the war a little bit more. The memorial is free! Which is awesome for budget travelers. Near the entrance you can find huge walls with all the names of the victims from each respective country that died in the Korean War, so that was also very special. It's nice to see the recognition showed by Korea to every country that tried to help them. If you're interested there are also war machines out in the front of the memorial with vehicles such as tanks and a big war ship."
22,3.0,"When you're interested in Korean history, this museum is a must visit. However, I found it a bit dull. The information was presented very simple, without any 'extra's.'I think I expected more information about the course of the war. The information could have been presented way more interactive, or with some items to go with it."
23,5.0,A wonderful memorial to those who were lost in the “forgotten” and continuing war.  This memorial gives you a feeling for the losses suffered by the Korean military and civilian population which escapes Mose Americans.  A Highly recommended stop.
24,5.0,Spent the morning there and it's a must to see. It's wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past. It brings it home to you what South Korea went through and how many countries were involved. It also reminds you that it was one of the poorest countries after the war and how far it has come now.
25,4.0,"Very well done war museum that tells the story of all of the wars Korea has faced in its history. But for Western visitors, it's sufficient to focus here solely on the exhibition dedicated to the Korean War. It's a great place to learn about the war that essentially brought the Republic of Korea to where it is today. Definitely worth a short visit."
26,5.0,"This is a massive museum providing information about wars and military strategy throughout the history of Korea (and, now, South Korea).  While an English Language tour was provided, it started out focusing intensely (in terms of time invested) on the ""Korean War"" (which I suppose is what most English speakers want to know about).  We were hoping for more of an overview of the museum, so we left the group early.  It took us 2 hours to see the entire museum quickly.  All signage is in English."
27,5.0,"this memorial park and cemetery is beautiful and very moving. we learned alot in the little museum there about the Korean War, also a beautiful park"
28,5.0,"An excellent museum to learn about Korea. Great exhibits and storytelling. Entrance is free and you can download an audio guide when you get there using their free Wi-Fi. There's some focus on wars, but lots of general history as well. Explains a lot about why the country is the way it is. Would highly recommend for people who enjoy history."
29,4.0,The museum is quite big it will easily take 4-5 hours to go thru all. So we joined a hour guided tour. Very good. Now we understand more about the history and how the Korean people were suffering. Is a MUST if you wanted to know the history how north and South Korea were seperated. We spent about 3 hours there but still didn’t manage to see all. It is free why not!
30,4.0,"Great museum, lots of cool exhibits. Great service and very tourist friendly. Free & no cost which is great. Must visit if you come to Seoul! Learned lots about all the wars Korea was in and Korean history! :)"
31,5.0,This was a wonderful museum to visit. The tributes to the Korean wars was thorough and well-done. We spent half a day at the museum and only saw about half the museum. I highly recommend!
32,5.0,This is a must see if in Seoul. The museum was very artfully done and told the history of war in Korea. I am not a fan of war museums but this one was amazing. I loved all the different visual effects and felt they did a wonderful job of recognizing the refugees of the wars and especially the section that acknowledged and thanked all the countries involved and lives lost in the North/South Korean War. Such an interesting display.
33,5.0,"For history buffs like myself, you should set aside at least half a day for this sprawling war memorial and museum. The outdoor section includes symbolic monuments, planes, tanks, and a 4-D video exhibit about heroic South Korean sailors which made me tear with emotion. The indoor section has 3 levels which you should start from the bottom. It starts from the evolving of Korea from even B.C. times all the way post-Korean War - that's literally two thousand years of warring history. There are plenty of exhibits and videos and 4-D experiences. My fiancée and I walked away with a deeper appreciation of the sacrifices of so many, and the realization that ""Freedom is not free""."
34,5.0,"There are many beautiful museums in the world - this is how it will end up in one of the most interesting - as always in this area it gives rise to a lot of sad emotions and thoughts but such places are very important for people not to make the same mistakes! A beautiful, sad place that can show a piece of history to a man"
35,5.0,"What can you say about war memorials? It’s a memorial, not a museum. It’s a must visit, but we didn’t stay more than an hour. Wouldn’t visit again, but would recommend to friends."
36,5.0,"Definitely worth visiting! One of the best museums I've ever visited. Very informative, amazingly done, and all of that for free!"
37,5.0,This was on our to do list for our one day excursion to Seoul and it was definitely worth the time. It is a tribute to those who fought and died during the Korean war.
38,5.0,"This is an excellent war museum and memorial.  If you must choose, this museum is much more interesting than the National Museum of Korea.  The exhibits are thorough and updated; overall much larger than I expected.  Plan to spend several hours exploring and learning about this important era."
39,5.0,If you have any interest in the war between North and South then it is worth the visit. We have a belief that when we visit any country it is great to try and visit as many places that hold interest.
40,5.0,Its free entrance and very easy to find. We went there on a monday sadly you cant board the gun boat. But you will find more amazing war machine aside from that.
41,4.0,Large museum on Korean War presented from Korean point of view.  Generally positive and contains a lot of information which will satisfy history buffs.  Worth visiting especially since there is no admisson.
42,5.0,What a great way to spend the day learning more about Korea! Totally worth the trip. We loved taking our time exploring the museum. Very well done--each and every room is wonderful!
43,4.0,"Enjoyed our visit here. The outdoor area had lots of planes and tanks, and the museum and information inside was great. Good place fo families or those with an interest in Korean War history. Free to enter."
44,5.0,"PROS:* Excellent presentation of the history why there are two Koreas* Proud of the United States' contribution. Understood America's involvement spurred because of not wanting to support the spread of communism and socialism.* Beautiful museum.CONS:* Was a bit hard to find from the bus stop.  Google Maps did not bring us to the front and we had to walk around.  The guard helped us find the front entrance.* No cons of the museum.  Immersive, interactive and educational."
45,5.0,"This makes the Imperial  War Museum in  London look like crap! There is every type of military vehicle imaginable on display in the grounds and you can climb all over them. In the museum, there are separate exhibits for children and the history of Korea is shown through its various invasions and conquests. Interesting and well presented with plenty of interaction most of which is in English, Mandarin  and Japanese. The memorial itself is beautiful and moving. Well worth a visit even if you are not a military enthusiast."
46,5.0,"This museum should be on your travel list, if you have a few days.It gives you a very detailed overview about the history of Korea with a focus on the wars it fought.The key focus is of course on the Korean War and it gave us a lot of new insights and a clear understanding of it.The museum is free and you should take at least 2-3 hours time when you plan to visit it."
47,5.0,Very nice museum and Memorial. Large airplane venue with all Korean War airplanes and jets used during war. Had a nice live military march display and plenty of war history. Would go back if ever in Seoul again.
48,5.0,Worth every minute. Gives real feeling of this not justified war that caused many many casualties of Korean civilians and American soldiers. Many interactive activities. Good organization. Monument very impressive. A Seoul must to my opinion
49,5.0,"The Korean war is very important in the contemporan history of Korea, we went to the english guided tour done by a guide who had some souvenirs from the period. weapons, tanks, ships military plans.. A place to visit in seoul"
50,3.0,I think everyone has to go here once. It's one of those things you do as a tourist. Some of the sights are cool but overall it does not compare to other international cities.
51,5.0,"The memorials are spectacular as was the military school display that was taking place when we arrived at 10am. You can easily spend hours walking around the tanks, planes and other military artifacts in the park."
52,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea is well done.  It has something to hold the interest of all age levels.We were impressed.Admission is free.Be sure to take the English brochure at the counter.
53,5.0,Great museum to learn about the war of Korea. Had outdoor and indoor exhibits to visit with planes and ships. Good place to go to learn more about what occurred during the war.
54,5.0,"As history enthusiasts we visit a lot of museums and this one was well worth the trip. It is easily accessible from the Samgakji metro station.The museum is beautifully designed and set out, and the exhibitions are informative and thought provoking. All the signage boards are in English. I particularly enjoyed the large outdoor sculptures, monuments and the war vehicles area which includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and a warship, some of which you can go aboard. You could easily spend a couple of hours here. There is a cafe and a museum shop in the building."
55,5.0,"We spent a week in Seoul, and I would rate the War Memorial my favorite attraction. South Korea really went all out on this -- no expense was spared! I have been to other world-class war museums such as the War Museum in London and the Artillery Museum in St Petersburg, Russia -- but Seoul's War Memorial tops them all.Before one enters the main complex of the Memorial, one passes through an immense park packed with military hardware and statues.There are several floors within the museum -- which is free, by the way. There are several theaters that display either holograms or 3-D presentations. My favorite was a theater that was cooled down to about 2 degrees C with snow on the ground. The narrator of the 3-D presentation is a Korean war veteran who relates that one of the most difficult aspects of the mountainous warfare was the temperature factor -- and to reenforce this snow is blown into your face. It is clear that the Korean War is remembered to this day in South Korea with great vividity, and the museum emphasizes Korea's commitment to UN peace-keeping operations. The present-day tense situation with North Korea is refected in exhibitions within the museum, to emphasize that the horrors of the last war could manifest themselves again.The first floor of the museum boasts full-scale replicas of ancient Korean warships, and depictions of Korean's earlier war history in Asia."
56,4.0,"The memorial is worth a visit if you have a couple of hours. The exhibits are interesting.There is a section on the armor used in the wor such as Russian tanks, a MIG 15, and other military weapons, There is a Cadillac Limousine gifted by President Eisenhower to the South Korean people.Free admiision. Clean rest room facilities and a small cafe are available."
57,5.0,"This War Memorial is just amazing. We spent 4 hours here, taking in all the history of the terrible Korean War. Outside exhibits of military aircraft and tanks is very well done and the statue of the Brothers is just so heart wrenching it will have you gripped. This is such a well put together experience you will leave there certainly more clued up on a war that frankly, we knew very little about and the uk sent over 81,000 troops there!!"
58,4.0,"This was the first place we visited when we arrived in Seoul as it was just a 10 minutes walk from where we were staying. Because we arrived late, we rushed through the exhibits but we were taken aback by the incredible history it documents. It should be specially interesting for children. The multimedia use is quite effective and at places you might need to pause. We came back from there wanting to learn more about the history of South and North conflict, and Japanese occupation."
59,5.0,"We assumed that this museum would mostly be about the Korean War, but we were wrong. Not only did it have a ton of stuff on that war, but so much more. For example they had what I think was one of the best and most educating sections from the Vietnam War. I was actually very surprised at how many different wars that S Korea has helped allied forces through the years. I could go on and on about this museum, just trust me it is worth it!The museum is free, but please make a donation before you leave."
60,5.0,"Give yourself plenty of time at this memorial.  It takes a good hour or more outside to view all the tanks, planes, boats and missile launchers as well as the statues.  Inside there are 3 floors of history all very well organized into groups.  Loved learning more about a war I was unfamiliar with."
61,3.0,"The Korean War Memorial is a large, imposing building near Samgakji metro station in an otherwise nondescript neighbourhood. Its size is a testament to the centrality of the Korean war to the recent history and identity of the Republic of Korea and its troubled relationship to North Korea. It is part shrine (listing the names of the hundreds of thousands of South Korean and UN/allied service-people who died in the war), part museum (giving detailed accounts of the war) and part a propaganda organ, shouting the South's version of the conflict. Despite the importance of its subject, it is far too detailed, even for a visitor - a military historian - who knows a bit about the war. I saw two young Australian women who were enduring a detailed guided tour, who plainly did not really want the detail they were being given. A lot of the presentations deal with aspects of military operations, of course, and the audio-visual programs are often hard to understand. The display outside the museum of military hardware is frankly underwhelming, unless you really do want to see (and climb into) every variety of armoured personnel carrier that the South Korean army has ever used. The galleries generally lack the element of the 'personal stories' now obligatory in most military museums.The presentation of the place (which has been open for about 25 years) is looking a bit tired (eg the 'moat' has been drained) but it's certainly worth visiting, showing the impact of the Korean war on the country, while the long corridors of names on the 'roll of honour' (which doesn't include the couple of million civilians the war killed) is sobering."
62,4.0,"I have been to a lot of war museums in different countries and I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is by far the most advanced and interactive among them all! The museum has 3D and 4D movie rooms, a shooting area and an outdoor display of actual artillery, jets, passenger planes and ships that were used during the war. To acknowledge the help South Korea received from other countries during the war, the museum featured the countries' complete military uniforms and displayed the number of foreign military personnel that were deployed during the war. Best part of it all is that admission is free! Note, however, that the museum is closed on Mondays."
63,3.0,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea on Monday and found it to be shut. Many museums are closed on Monday so check before you go. It is a 500m walk from Samgakji subway station. They have an impressive outside exhibit which we were able to view including tanks, planes and boats."
64,5.0,"Good museum to visit and see the full history and unfolding of the Korean War. All explanations also in English, including the 4D video screening"
65,2.0,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea and found it to be shut on Monday’s. So disappointed. Many museums are shut on Monday, make sure you check before you go. They do have a large exhibit outside which was great to see. There were boats, planes and missives."
66,5.0,Large and fitting memorial to the Korean War.  Well-presented displays.  Most displays have English translations.  Most videos are in Korean with no subtitles.  Worth the time for the history buff.
67,3.0,"Impressive location and building , some interesting exhibits and also a replica of the only UN cemtery ( original at Busan) which was moving.Cafes and toilets on site. Admission is free. Take a 100WON coin to use the free of charge lockers, rather that carting your back pack round.There is a real tangiable thankfullness from the Korean people for those that served and died from the UN "" for a land they had never been to, a people they had never met"" .Closest subway staion is Samgakji (line 4 or 6) exit 12. Come out of sign posted exit and keep walking , you come to it round the corner on your left."
68,5.0,"Went to the Memorial the day before a scheduled DMZ tour.  It is well organized and interesting.  There is an outdoor exhibit of tanks, planes and boats used in the Korean war.  Exhibits are marked  in English and Korean.  Spent several hours at this museum."
69,5.0,"This was a great place to learn more in-depth what the war was like and struggles of those who fought through it. Their are so many displays and exhibits written in English. This museum is one of the best war museums I’ve been to. They have a large selection of Korean War era military weapons. Also on display outside, there’s quite the variety of tanks and airplanes. You could easily spend a few hours there learning about the war. I would highly recommend seeing this museum."
70,5.0,This is my third visits and reviews. This museum is amazing. I just came back from a week visit in D.C and went so many museums there and other museums all over the world but this is one of the best museum in the world. I can`t believe it`s free. You may wanna go there by yourself or with somebody who is really interested in history because you can easily spend 3-4 hours here. You learn so much not just about war but history and people who were affected. This museum is not about korean military but for everybody who sacrificed and affected. I highly recommend to take KTX and go to Busan after this because they have UN cemetary and this museum will make you appreciate and can`t help getting emotional after learning what happned. Make sure to eat before you go because there are not many places to eat around and their cafeteria is not the best.
71,4.0,"This is a must go while in Korea in order to get to know better the details of the Korean war. It is not a sophisticated museum, but is definitely informative."
72,5.0,"This War Memorial evoked feelings I never thought I had about wars. I have never been through one and with this visit, it was an eye opener. My respect to veterans, soldiers around the world. I salute you."
73,5.0,"There is a very special and honoring feeling when you go to this museum.Very thankful for everyone's sacrifices and lives for peace.Great format.Clean.Friendly staff.Good collection.Well thought displays.Organized.Great learning.Thank you for everyone who made it possible for us to learn and be thankful of your sacrifices, help, courage ."
74,5.0,"The War Memorial includes a museum, military hardware outside and several monuments to the fallen. I don't visit too many museums but found this extremely interesting as i learnt all about the Korean War. The museum is free to enter and at certain times of the day there are free tours in English and other languages. Outside is a wonderful display of tanks, planes, artillery and even a naval vessel. At the front of the museum there are several monuments commemorating the fallen. Inside there are free lockers to store bags."
75,5.0,"I've been to the War Memorial of Korea several times.  Each time I learn something new.  It's a great museum and has very cool exhibits that make it easy to understand the history.  I especially like the exhibits on the Korean War.  If you visit, I recommend doing the 4D theater experience of the Battle for Incheon.  It was fun (and free).  Actually, the whole museum is free, but they do accept donations.  They also run tours in multiple languages."
76,4.0,We didn't even go inside as it wasn't open that but still spent an hour looking at the memorials in the gardens. Very poignant.
77,5.0,A wonderful tribute to those that sacrificed for the freedom of South Korea. Must see for anyone visiting Seoul!
78,5.0,A sobering look at the geopolitics of the Korean peninsula. Ignore some of the South Korean propaganda and you'll get a great perspective of what makes Korea tick. Walk through all the floors to discover fascinating  history of Korea. I would suggest going to this place first; You'll see Seoul in quite a different light.
79,5.0,Enjoyed the War Memorial. Gave more insight on the war and got to see artifacts and listen to stories. Would recommend while in Seoul. You also don't need a tour guide to go and enjoy.
80,5.0,"I didn't know that much about the Korean war (except having watched every episode of MASH), for instance I hadn't realised that just over a thousand British servicemen were lost that's less than the Northern Ireland troubles and that over 30 thousand US servicemen were killed. It was good to see that all countries that supplied servicemen and women were represented with a memorial and flag and a short description of their commitments. I did enjoy the military equipment graveyard, even the wife didn't complain.  My interest was piqued about the previous Japanese invasions of Korea having seen the displays of the turtle ships. I've now read several articles about these invasions. It's well worth visiting the memorial, if nothing else than paying your respects for our fallen countryman."
81,5.0,Hey! Don’t be a loser. Go to the memorial. It has a totally sweetsauce outside section with planes and tanks that you can get into and take photos. Tons of super cute kids running around doing cute stuff. Cool boat that you can climb around on. The entrance to the inside has massive walls of all the names of fallen soldiers. Tried to find people with my last name. Couldn’t. Which was a bummer but also good. If you walk the inside direction backwards not only do you get a lot of “what a idiot looks” but also it feels like you are traveling back in time. You can only bar hop and eat food so many hours in a day and with that 2 hour break come here.A
82,5.0,"A huge war museum with detailed information in English and Korean about South-Korea's war-filled past. It's free entry and you can see original tanks, planes and boats and 4D screenings."
83,5.0,"We started off with the outside expositions. There are two exhibits and many planes, tanks, 2 small boats and 1 large you that you can board and visit the insides. We watched the 3D movie after visiting the boat (I'd recommend watching it beforehand). Turns out it's the exact boat from the battle in 2002. They've indicated all the bullet holes in red, which really makes reality sink in.Once you walk in inside, there is a stand with pamphlet and a museum map. It goes without saying to follow the arrows on the ground. We started off with the last exhibits by accident and were a bit confused, as the exhibitions are in chronological order.The preservation of all the artifacts are impeccable. The amount of donated artifacts is astounding. Everything is translated in English and is very detailed.War buff or not, this is a must. It is a wonderful exhibit."
84,5.0,Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul. The admission is free and the museum has something for everyone.Outside there are several airplanes and tanks to observe. Each one has a sign explaining what it was used for during the war. Near the ship there is a 3D movie representing what it was like to be in a fighter jet.Inside the museum the displays are very respectful and detailed. There are several texts to read and short movies to watch. It explains very well the war and outcome of Korea. It is possible to spend an hour as it is possible to spend all day at this location.
85,5.0,"You could easily spend an entire day in this museum and still not see everything. There were renovations being made to the pavers in front of the main entrance when I visited, so I sort of came in on the side. That gave me an opportunity to view more of the monuments outside, including the MacArthur Tree, which I had no idea even existed. The museum spans all of Korean history, not just the recent conflict. It is well worth the time to take a leisurely tour of the exhibits if at all possible. Just the war machinery outside could be a morning or afternoon.I recommend spending the 1000 won to feed the fish. It's a peaceful way to end the visit."
86,5.0,I am no so fan of museum since its hard to understand but this place it is worthy to see it! Inside all the story it's explained about the Korean war and if you don't have time you have outside  all the  planes and tanks from the war. Also the memorial itself is stunning!!!
87,5.0,"* Spent most of the day there* Outside area with tanks, planes and rockets* Very comprehensive history of the Korean war, plus one floor dedicated to the earlier history, including Japanese occupation* Impressive building* 4D cinema show* Nice grounds with water and gardens* Free entry, and also free book on the topic* Also a kids museum (although did not look round this), and they had a kids play area and cafe etc* In short, one of the best museums in the world that we have visited"
88,5.0,Only  the view on this musea is allready imposant.The expositions are respectfull to the history and give you A lot of information  about the korean war.The lost of soliders and also the UN soldiers is many.You will vind all the namens of the Dutch lostI recomended to visit this museum.The fee is free
89,5.0,"Very detailed, interesting and interactive museum on the Korean War. While it is sometimes a bit biased in its presentation of the Korean War and aftermath it's much less the case than expected. A must do in Seoul!"
90,5.0,Visit the war museum in the afternoon it was the best war memorial museum I have seen in the world.  Highly recommended
91,5.0,"As a Vietnamese, being able to witness the B52 with my own eyes is something very special. I took my sister here and we were in shock the whole time. Every tanks, airplane and ships are in excellent condition. A very good place for children to learn about history as well!"
92,5.0,It's an interesting place to spend a couple of hours. I like how they emphasize the costs of the war to the ordinary families. A good educational experience.
93,5.0,"Each time I return to Korea, this is a must see on my list. This year for the first time I took my wifre. This is not a day to rush. Take ypur time, look and read. The displays inside and out ate second to none and the constant upgrades with technology have made this a must see. Be prepared to shed a tear when you sit in one of the many viewing/video rooms  and the remembrance hall and chamber. The new 3 and 4 D interactive  shows bring the story of a nation besieged and the world that stood by it. The Korean people are so grateful and will never forget the contributions of all other nations and this is made very clear in their hommage to all that stepped in to help them. Returned Servicemen and women and veterans, if you have PTSD then the reality of some of the displaus and shows may cause you to trigger. Every time I see something new and have left without a tear in my eyes. The raw honesty of this facility even left my wife in tears. Please leave a couple of thousand Won in one of the donation boxes. This is a free admission and it really helps to provide an amazing experience. P.S. if you are taking a school group, please ask the kids to show respect, no yelling, swearing and running around. This is a memorial to thousands who will never go home and a somber reminder of the great waste and distruction of armed conflict."
94,5.0,"This museum was very informative and being an American whose grandfather fought in the war, it was very touching. The Korean people are very thankful to the UN for fighting alongside them. I learned a lot about the war, as did my boyfriend who is a history buff."
95,5.0,"Most poignant was the statute of 2 brothers embracing on the field of battle, one fighting for the North and one for the South, standing on a dome with a crack in it representing the division of the Koreas.   A number of airplane including a B52 bomber as well as a Korean made observation airplane the type of which hadn’t been seen in decades until it was discovered in a Korean high school and restored.    Lots of information about the War.   Only a couple blocks from 2 Metro stops - we took the #4 line."
96,5.0,"This was one of the stops on our bus tour and it looked nice on the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. It is really informative and very well done. Good for kids too, as there are many things to see for them (planes, boats etc.). We didn't go into the museum, just walked around outside. Very impressed, totally worth a visit!"
97,5.0,"I have been to several memorials throughout the world and this is one of the best. There is an outdoor museum displaying various tanks, guns, aircraft and a patrol boat. It even has a B-52 bomber on display. The staff are friendly and helpful and the exhibits are really well put together. I will go again for another look next time im in Seoul."
98,5.0,We thought it was going to be a quick trip but stayed all day. There are so many things to see and lots of english to read. The statues were fantastic and the whole day was well spent.
99,5.0,"We were really impressed with how interesting this museum was. The building itself was huge and was architecturally significant in itself. The memorial spanned over a few levels and was quite creative in how it presented its information. There were large scale replicas, video displays and outside there was a large collection of military vehicles. We spent a couple of hours here."
100,5.0,"I am one who is normally not interested in museum tours. Since I was in a group who is interested I went along with them. Our English Guide, Mr Park ,who is a retired military colonel explained so passionately about Korean war history that I felt so enlightened and inspired and appreciated Korea in a different light beside it's a paradise for shopping and food. Thank you Mr Park for extending extra time and sharing so much with us."
101,5.0,"Went expecting to be there for a couple of hoursFive hours later we had to leave as we had other things to seeAnd we only scratched the surfaceExpected to focus on the Korean War but this place is about so much more, from 'ancient history' to current conflicts and peacekeeping. And it is all so wonderfully doneEnough english to explain without being wordyGood clear logical route through, just follow the arrows on the floorOne of the best museums we have been to, anywhere in our 70+ countries so far"
102,5.0,"Our visit lasted almost six hours.  The first hour was spent outside, in extremely cold weather, looking at aircraft, tanks, missiles, bombs, trucks, helicopters, and even a war ship from the last 100 years.  Very impressive outdoor memorials that are worth visiting as well.  Once inside, a wide variety of displays from the beginning of civilization through all the wars is on display; way too numerous to even begin to describe. Excellent, HUGE building, first-class all the way.  Korea is proud of their military, their history, and their patriotism."
103,4.0,"As an history buff, going to Seoul without being to the war memorial is half the experience. The museum was well organized with great exhibits. The only down side was the fact that for some attractions, curtain hours are available. So you cant always explore every aspect of it."
104,5.0,This war museum gets better every time I visit it. I remember when it first opened over 20 years ago and it gets better every time I visit it. It's definitely a must-see location for Korea visitors.
105,5.0,"This museum is a must see when in Seoul,  very interesting exhibits inside. The outside statues and displays are incredible. I loved looking at all the planes, tanks etc.  I have no idea how they got a b-52 in downtown Seoul but it's very impressive."
106,5.0,This is a MUST visit. The museum is amazingly rich with the war history of Korea with special emphasis on the Korean War.Try and have a guided tour as this will lead you through the most interesting stops in this museum. Later on you can go back and re-visit it.Entrance is free and so are the guided tours.We learned A LOT from it.
107,5.0,"We stumbled upon this place because it is near our hotel. We now wonder why we did not visit this place on our previous trips to Seoul. It is not just a memorial. There was an open air exhibit of the armament that took part in the Korean War. There is also a military history museum, showing warfare on the Korean peninsular from ancient time to the Korean War. Highly recommended to all who are interested in history and warfare."
108,5.0,"I was born after the Korean so this was especially interesting.  I really learned a lot and I love going to war museums in different countries especially to get a different perspective.  The plane, chopper and tank display outside was amazing.  I would really recommend to Americans to take the time to visit here."
109,5.0,"We caught the subway here from our hotel expecting to spend an hour. It was easily 3 hours, an excellent place to visit and learn the history of the Korean war. Some of the best displays we have seen and most have explanations in several languages ( if I remember correctly; Korean, English, Chinese & Japanese) Also if you are into military vehicles then you will appreciate the outdoor display. Well worth a visit."
110,5.0,"Visited this museum as my husband is keen on looking at tanks. Was a bit hesitant at first, but tagged along anyway. To my surprise, it was very interesting! The exhibitions are multi-lingual so we could read and fully understand. There were a lot of interactive and immersive displays too. Best part - admission is free! :D"
111,5.0,"Impressive.  Quite a distance out the city, we were surprised at the size of the grounds the memorial/museum is.  We were also surprised at the amount of security here and in Seoul in general but unbeknownst to us Donald Trump was in town.One of the best attractions in Korea, it was not difficult to spent hours here.  I always visit war memorials and museums, humbled to be able to experience something of the wars from the perspective of others. ?We were here for around 5 hours in total, but could have stayed longer.We wandered around the outside memorials and and equipment before heading up the front steps where we were greeted by a gentleman welcoming visitors.  He told us that it was a very special day and the reason for all the security was trump.  He made us very welcome and gave us good information  to get started.The museum is large and we really didn't do it justice.  It was very sobering and moving.  We also attended the Da Vinci Alive exhibition - The realm of a genius, which took up another couple of hours."
112,5.0,A very well organised museum which fully emerges the visitor in Korea’s tortured war history. Highly recommended for all visitors to the city.
113,4.0,"The memorial outside was just as, if not more interesting than the museum inside and really highlights both the losses felt by Korea and their gratitude to nations that came to their aid during the Korean war."
114,5.0,"This place was fantastic. They had loads of real vehicles and weapons in many previous wars on display that you can actually go right up to. There are tons of things to do inside as well dating back to the beginning of Korea all the way to present day. They have memorials to all the fallen soldiers from Korea and the UN that participated in a number of different wars. It's just a fantastic and beautiful place to visit. There are a few restaurants and cafe's to hit up while you're inside as well.It's a huge place and takes hours to see it all. Unfortunately, my visit was kind of on a time crunch and I didn't get to see everything, but I would love to go back sometime and visit again. If I could give more that 5/5 I would."
115,5.0,I learned so much about the Korean War that I did not know before. Museum was well organized and I could not believe it was free
116,5.0,This is a great place to visit.  Large museum with lots of interesting exhibits of wars over the years.  Large outdoor area with many tanks and aircraft on display for you to look at and climb on.  We spent all afternoon here.  Free entry and easy to get to on the underground.  Five minute walk from station.
117,5.0,A very informative museum.  The outside display of tanks and planes was very interesting and gave a good perspective.  Inside (all free) was history of war throughout Korean history (which was very informative).  The 2nd and 3rd floor was dedicated to the recent Korean conflict (1950-1953) and had informative and interesting displays and videos. We spent 2 hours there and did not see everything.  A must for Americans with a connection to the Korean was (my father fought).  Keep in mind it is focused on the impact of the war on the Korean people (displays in Korean and  English).
118,5.0,"Admission is free!  This is a very nice museum with history dating back to B.C. with an enormous collection of things from A.C.  As well as several vehicles, tanks, etc.  The iron statues outside were huge and beautiful!  Many local children there on a Saturday with their teachers learning the history.  Most of the displays have English buttons so you can hear the stories in English."
119,5.0,"I am so sorry I didn't have more time to give it at least half a day. The building is huge, so clean and nice inside, with lots of original and replica exhibits, audio, educational videos, fun stuff to do and an impressive outdoor area to see all the planes, tanks, boats and whatnot. Oh, and I think the entrance was free. They also have a kids area, didn't really visit that one."
120,4.0,It was freezing cold but there were so much to see and learn.  Felt sad knowing facts of Wars.  Realized how lucky we are now.  Totally worth going.
121,5.0,"We spent almost two full days in this 3 story museum. It was structured chronologically and gave insights from the ancient times all the way to today's current situation.It was a lot of information, but explained in a very uncomplicated way and not only through text, but also artifacts, visuals, videos, interviews, maps and other interactive tools. It was very well structured and we actually think we know so much more about the Korean conflict and its history now. Outside you'll find a range of military vehicles, planes etc.Definitely a must-see and not doable in just one hour if you are genuinely keen on understanding South Korea's history (not just in terms of the war, but also its evolution and development economically)."
122,4.0,"Not far from central Seoul, could easily be combined with other downtown sitesThe indoor exhibits were very interesting but all that walking on the marble floors got to me after a while.There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well. Lots of statues, and a large, quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars. While you are in Korea, I really recommend taking a moment to reflect"
123,5.0,"There is a 3D and 4D experience hereBut it only open once in a hour (and at the same time)I recommend go directly into 4D before visiting the museum. It takes quite a long time if you really look, read, watch carefully."
124,5.0,Not knowing very much about the Korean war this was a great learning experience. It is a very large facility you can easily spend a whole afternoon here.
125,5.0,"I've been to the War Memorial several times and have always enjoyed it. It is so interesting to see all of the planes, tanks and other machines outside around the museum. Inside is just as interesting. It definitely takes some time to see everything, though. It is not a place to go when you are in a hurry, unless you just walk around the outside displays."
126,3.0,"We found the memorial to be huge, you could easily spend several hours in here. Lots of information and history. There were lockers to store your belongings and a small cafe inside too. We were surprised to find the admission was free."
127,5.0,"This place was amazing, I can spend my whole day here going through their exhibits and watching their videos. You'll learn a lot and enjoy yourself while doing so. The visit here was also very moving."
128,5.0,"This war memorial is also a war museum. I give this place a 5 stars rating for its outdoor exhibits  of war ship, planes, tanks, rockets, statues and the indoor photos and exhibits. The admission is free and I would strongly suggest a 3 hours tour of this place to be able to at least cover about 80 % of the place. Strongly recommended to visit; especially if you are also planning to visit the DMZ. The indoor exhibits will give you a general view of the Korean War."
129,5.0,It's on the route of the hop on hop off bus but you will need at least a half a day to see it all. Amazing park around the huge building. The park is full of war machines starting from little small motorcycle to a bomber plane and a us navy ship
130,5.0,We learned all about the Korean War.  It is a beautiful memorial for all those who sacrificed.  I am glad we went.  We had a guide but we didn't need one.  This is one museum that has a ton of English explanations and videos.  It was actually distracting to have a guide.  I wish we didn't have one.
131,5.0,Great place to go to brush up on your korean history. We enjoyed Our short tour here before our JSA tour. The statues outside were great.
132,5.0,"Free entrance and a very cool experience for me to visit the place and learn more about the Korean War that my grandfather fought in as a 17 year old kid. This gave me a better understanding of what happened, the Korean conflict, the USA involvement, and the sacrifices that were made. Many vehicles, tanks, planes, etc.. to see. We happily spent 2-3 hours here. I feel privileged to be able to vist this place that not so long ago was under attack."
133,4.0,"Free entry to well organised war museum. We went on a Sunday and it was strangely quiet. The 4D, 3D and 2D short movies were very informative. Lot of photo opportunities for real life replica of vehicles, weapons etc"
134,5.0,My husband and I went here and only planned to spend 2 hours here. We needed much more time and wish we would have planned half a day here. The whole memorial is mind blowing and inspiring. Go and visit if you can.
135,5.0,"Definitely a place to visit! With planes, tanks, and lots of other war and military equipments on display, it's worth a look. For someone who knew little about the Korean War, the three levelled museum (free entrance) was very captivating, informative, and English-speaking friendly. There are films and a couple 4D experiences as well. We spent over two hours and only saw the displays outside and the second level. To see the whole museum I would put aside more time if you wanted to see the whole thing. Highly recommend it!"
136,5.0,"Highly recommend US visitors go early during your trip to this memorial. Great materials, shows, etc. to explain the background and details of the Korean War. This visit gave us the context to understand many of the things we saw during our stay. Expansive buildings and grounds."
137,5.0,"Everything you might want to know about the Korean War and a large inventory of tanks, planes, helicopters and even some boats outside.Recommend spending at least an hour or two."
138,5.0,"I would definitely put this on your too do list. It not only has a focus on the Korean war but also in depth look at battles fought over the past 1500 years.There is no entry fee for this exhibit, but donation boxes are located on site.  Very close to the train station and the National Museum."
139,5.0,"You can easily spend 2-3 hours between the exhibits and outdoor equipment displays. Especially liked the B-52. The exhibits cover a lot of Korean military history from ancient times. Non-native visitors will likely find the 2nd level (what Westerners refer to as the Korean conflict) the most interesting. If you're pressed for time or not a hardcore history nerd, see that area first before venturing further."
140,5.0,the very first thing to do when you in Seoul. It is all free so really a must try. highly recommend froe everyone
141,5.0,"This could b a whole days activity if u like the history of any wars that Korea has been involved in. I went because my father was a Korean War Veteran but it has three stories of history of Korean wars back to 16 BC. It has a big display of military vehicles that children can get into eg planes, tanks and a big ship. It has a children's museum as well. Well worth visiting. U could take lunch and sit in the gardens to eat."
142,5.0,"More of a museum than a memorial, but it does not matter.Fascinating and emotionaly moving site everybody should visit when in Seoul. Admission is free, the visit takes about 2 hours and the exhibits are just...impressive."
143,5.0,I truly believe that the War Memorial of Korea is a must visit location when visiting Korea. Being from a western country where war has not been waged in my country for over 150 years (Canada) it was an experience to see what Korean people have gone though for many years. And this place is free to visit!The museum focuses on war from ancient times to modern times. There are some great exhibits on the Japanese occupations and wars of Korea. but the real highlight is the modern wars. Learning and knowing the suffering that the Korean people have gone through and how far they have come from being so poor after war to where they are now is amazing. It is also good to remember that they are constantly being threatened with war again and again even today. There are many old pieces of machinery outside and there are even a few you can go inside. These are great to see up close and feel these huge machines. I really do recommend everyone to visit this location when they are in Seoul.You can check out this and other attractions like the National Museum of Korea on our website at the link in my profile.
144,4.0,"Went here in Sept. 2017. Was a memorable experienceLovely well maintained gardens.Well laid out. Loved Indian and Great Britain areas. Would definitely recommend everyone visiting Seoul to go. I did not want to leave,it is very pleasant feeling to stay longer."
145,5.0,"I was impressed. The was it was set up, the sprawling complex was breathtaking. I especially love the collection of aircrafts. Watched the 3D movie, learned a thing or two about the Koreans sense of duty and their devotion in defending their motherland. Great experience!"
146,5.0,"This is a fantastic museum. Presents a good view of the Korean War, with heavy emphasis on the participation of other countries. Exhibits are in English, and there is a multilingual app available for other languages. Definitely worth a visit when staying in Seoul."
147,5.0,"Sure, outside is where you take all the selfies and Instagram moments. But it is inside where you will learn all about the wars that South Korea has fought in. The War Memorial is a very big place. Make sure you get a free brochure so you know where the 7 indoor exhibits are. There are numerous artifacts, and war documents. Be prepared to a few hour here or all day. Tips:Admission is free."
148,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea is a marvelous establishment to visit. Everyone visiting Seoul should visit this memorial and remember the sacrifices our fellow women & men made to keep this world safer. The exhibits are really impressive and they have taken care of each item with utmost attention. They have honored all the countries supported South Korea in the Korean War and remember their contribution of all the philosophy South Korea stands for. Do visit, entry to this memorial is free and you can enjoy the Armed Machinery exhibits in the grounds. Cheers,BokaBoy"
149,5.0,I went here with my husband (then bf) about a year ago and I loved it. It's very interesting with all the history and it's huge!
150,5.0,"If you want to know why South Korea is the South Korea it is today, visit this museum! I recommend going when they have a free tour in English- it is always helpful to have someone guide you through and tell you the most pertinent parts of the museum. After you can go through again and see anything you may have passed by."
151,5.0,"Visited this museum as we had seen the one in Pyongyang, which tells a different version of events.  Heaps to see and ended up staying a few hours browsing.  The outside area is good fun as you can poke around military vehicles.  If your in the area the American quarter is nearby for cradt beer.  We walked it in 20mins."
152,5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect but the war memorial does not disappoint. First, the place is huge. You will need 3+ hours to tour it. We spent an hour just outside of it looking at all the military hardware used during the Korean war and there is a small gunboat outside that was sunk in 2005. You get to go in it (it's a replica) and see the story behind it. Inside the war memorial, there are exhibit showcasing the story of the Korean people. Each floor is for a different period. the second floor shows the ""recent"" war of 1950. It's very chilling to see what happened. Overall I recommend it for everyone."
153,5.0,"A poignant memorial to commemorate the horrible war.Information and exhibits are very well displayed and informativeSituated near the city centre, it is easy to get to.Suggest spending 3hrs there for a comprehensive visit."
154,5.0,"We weren't really sure what to expect. The amount of aircraft on display was amazing. There is a ship outside by the aircraft with a great story of heroism. Make sure to catch the quick movie inside the ship. Once inside, the museum seems endless. It was emotional to see all of the hardships the South Korean people have been through. Definitely a must see while in Seoul."
155,5.0,"We have visited many war memorials and museums around the world including Auschwitz, Gallipoli, Long Tan and Monte CassinoThis rates very well amongst them as a place to visit and the Koreans have done it very well and spared no expense in doing it properlyThere is a whole floor dedicated to Korean history. Another two floors dedicated to the Korean War and the role of the UN in that war. Outside is an impressive display of military hardware as well as the memorial itself which recognises not only the South Koreans who died but all of those nations that fought alongside themAllow a minimum of three to four hours for your visitEntry is free but donations are accepted. I will guarantee that once you have been through you will be sure to want to make a donation"
156,5.0,"This was our most favorite spot in Seoul. Not only did we learn about the Korean War and appreciate peace and understand how such a great nation has become, we also enjoyed the beautiful landscape, architecture and sculptures. The English tour was especially great."
157,5.0,Whether you're interested in military history or not the War Memorial of Korea is not to be missed. The museum offers free tours regularly through out the day with friendly and knowledgeable guides. The displays are detailed and you come away having learnt a lot about the history of Korea and how it's become what it is today.
158,5.0,"To understand current Korea, you must understand the wars that made current Korea.  This is the place to get that understanding.  An impressive facade gives way to great exhibits that will fascinate you (yes, even those on ancient battles).  Exhibits are well put together, multimedia and informative.  Outside, there is a host of planes, tanks and boats - all fun to see.  I loved seeing many Korean families here with their children, carefully explaining things to them.  Take the subway and spend at least 3 or so hours."
159,5.0,"First wonderful grounds to walk around that includes military aircraft, tanks, and artillery. Then on to the museum. Free admission and a free book as well! I thought it would just be about the Korean War; however, it was actually a wonderful surprise to go through the entire history of Korea. A great variety of exhibits,very informative, and the staff was friendly as well. Highly recommend you include this in your visit."
160,5.0,"I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum while in Seoul. First of all, it's free! It's a huge museum that would probably take a few visits to really see everything. I took the English tour and that helped get some extra insight, but you could definitely just wander around by yourself. Great place to learn more about the Korean war as well as Korean history."
161,5.0,"Learn about how Korea took shape as a nation and of course the Korean War. Easy access by Metro, spend 2 hours or so here"
162,5.0,"First off, it's free! Second, it is very well laid out.Third, free lockers to store your stuff.Fourth, we found it was just fine doing it on our own without a guide. All the exhibits and such are in in English so we had no problems following the history of the war. And it is great history! I had no idea why, how, and such the war began and where it is today (just a cease fire). If you are in Seoul, this is a must visit. You will learn many things about how it began, the US involvement, the UN involvement, etc. We took the subway and once outside it was a short walk around the corner to the museum. There are same great statues out front and lots of military hardware on the one side. Again, an excellent museum that is not too crowded and very well laid out and easy to understand."
163,4.0,First of all the place is huge. Expect to spend over 2 hours there. I think it is worth the time. There's lots to see and I found it quite interesting. I would definitely recommend going.
164,5.0,"I've been to a lot of Peace Museums around the world and this may be the best. The building itself honors  the military subject matter within, yet has a quiet peacefulness with fountains, spacious halls and the flags of many nations who helped during the moment of crisis for Korea. Our English tour guide covered the sequence of events well and stayed within the one hour tour time. She was professional, interesting and gave multiple perspectives. English signage was everywhere so everything was understandable. At the end, they gave away a book that covered the day by day accounts of the events of the war. That was big for my husband who will want to continue to study the details of this war. Definitely worth your time to come for a visit."
165,5.0,"Went to the war memorial and museum last week.  There is a lot of Korean history contained in the 3 floors of the museum,  dealing with the military aspects of the country from its inception through the present,  with about half the space dedicated to the Korean War.  Most of the signs are in both Korean and English, and tours are available in both languages.  There is parking available,  but we actually walked there,  so I couldn't price it for you.  The museum itself is free.  It took my wife and I about 3 hours to go through the museum, walking slowly and reading most of the signs. We didn't sit through any of the movies.   There is of course a gift shop and cafe in the museum."
166,5.0,Very informative museum. Lots of detailed exhibits.We stuck to modern history and it took us ~3 hrs.Gardens /memorials outside were also very impressive.
167,4.0,"Took a half day tour to the border that divides South and North Korea. Lots of history to see along the border we had four stops and each of them is historic. One of the place we visited is an Infiltration Tunnel that the North built to cross the Southern part. We went a Train Station that used to service the Korean Peninsula, and there's a hill where one can view the Northern part with their Flag flying high. Very educational trip altogether."
168,5.0,"First, you can take what you want of photos inside and out and there is a lot to photograph.Second.  It is free.Third.  You need 5-6 hours and can easily spend a whole day there.This is a war memorial and war museum, not only about the ongoing war.  It is also about wars in Korea in general many ages back in time.  Of course, as usual, it turns out to be more about glorification of war than horrification.   That is the downside of history in museums, when you try to explain it in a museum the bad times and horror look like adventures.  So people never really learn how bad it was.  Anyway, this place is a must to visit in Seoul."
169,3.0,I'm not a huge war fan. In fact I hate it so this place did not appeal to me. But it is interesting and well laid out. So if you're interested in the military I would recommend visiting. Entry is free and the exhibitions are displayed in multiple languages.
170,5.0,"I normally get bored fairly quickly in museums, but this was great. Best museum I have ever visited! Loads of stuff to do and see. I learnt a lot about south Korea. Would be great for family's too. Only issue is that it closes early compared to the other museums in Seoul so we didn't get to see it all! Also it's free! But I would have happily paid to get in."
171,5.0,"Very interesting museum, huge amount of armaments on show in the grounds and museum itself (lots of planes, tanks, guns, and a boat - even has the first MiG that the Uwest got it hands on from defecting north korean.) Interesting content, esp korean war aspect, relatively unbiased and very informative. Best war museum I've been in!"
172,5.0,"The museum is very informative and explains the situations very well. A lot of artifacts, video support, statues etc.One of the best war museums that I have every seen.The museum is free and I think that museums about important happenings in history should always be free for people, because it is important that you learn/know these things."
173,5.0,"We arrived in time to take the 2pm English free tour. Our tour guide was a retired gentleman who had been volunteering at the memorial for 10 years. He gave us a brief summary of the war, then had us watch a film explaining what happened in greater detail (approx. 18 minutes long). He then took us to a 4D experience with 3D glasses and a moved platform, which we were seated and fixed into, while we watched a 7 minute video from a first person perspective of what it was like to participate in the war. He explained a few more interactive exhibits, before deposited us in another 4D movie. This time I think the 4th dimension was “freezing during winter” as the air-conditioning seemed to be turned up to maximum in the room! The story was about one gentleman’s story as he experienced the war. A few more exhibits explained and the tour was done.The memorial could be viewed without the guided tour, but I think doing the tour really brought it all together. There are many interactive displays within the memorial and one could easily spend the entire day there. There is a free audioguide system in place which can be accessed from your own mobile phone (but I didn’t personally try it out so I can’t tell you if it works or if the quality is any good); the memorial has free wifi to facilitate access.The memorial has six halls, each with their own theme: Memorial, War History, Korean War and UN Participation, Donated Relics, Expeditionary Forces and ROK Armed Forces. There's a cafeteria on-site if you're in need of a snack during your visit. The memorial is within easy walking distance from the nearest metro station (Samgakji)."

175,4.0,Provides a lot of good information about the wars Korea was associated with which led to the current situation.
176,5.0,"Previously I posted a review stating my disappointed in the condition of our room , yes they need refurbishing and some renovations but the hotel itself is excellent .The staff are the best in the world  and we have travelled extensively . We feel like family, if you are a friendly person they will embrace you with kindness, love and sense of fun .How they remember our names I have no idea but they all greet you with that huge infectious beautiful smile that makes you feel like you are at home .The housemaids cannot do enough to ensure you are happy, the barstaff are amazing and then there is the people in the restaurants ... nothing is an effort and they make you feel like royalty  The grounds are beautiful and perhaps the best beach in Fiji( we have stayed in 4 others ) great snorkeling !!Waterfall tour is worthwhile but check with the staff who has creditability as with other tours .Great place to unwind , no stress , everything provided ... we slept 10 hrs each night despite being at maximum capacity it still has a very relaxed vibe .Talk to the staff if you want to venture out.. we were lucky to be invited to their local Rugby  final ...WOW what an unbelievable experience .. thank you Shelly at The Sunset Bar 💕💕I'll be very sad to leave tomorrow not just because we return to sleeping 5 hrs and working 10 hr days but we will miss their faces and the kindness of the most beautiful people in Fiji Thank you ... btw I'll be back with my grandson .. this is kid's paradise 🤗"
177,5.0,Must see place while in South Korea! Huge! And very well done. Be prepared to come back though. You can't cover it all in one day and you WILL want ti see more!
178,5.0,"Hands down this is one of the best museums around.  The dioramas are spectacular, the 4D war experience was a great surprise and the monuments/boats/guns are neat to stroll through."
179,5.0,You can have insight about Korean war from the museum and you can also enjoy great art exhibitions too. The theme and contents of exhibition changes always.
180,5.0,"A huge museum, mainly dedicated to the experiences of the Korean War, with memorials to all the countries on the Allied side and the names of all those killed inscribed on the façade, which is vast. It was quite a shock to realise how many people were killed.Outside is boy toy heaven - lots of old planes, including a B52 bomber, tanks and a replica of the ship sunk by North Korea in 2010. Inside are some beautiful symbolic sculptures and more about the Korean armed forces than you would ever want to know. We visited on a Friday afternoon, where there was an hour long demonstration on how warfare had been carried out over the centuries, a military band and a display of marching and rifle twirling. All very entertaining. My guidebook says it happens at 2pm every Friday but not sure if this is the case. Even without the show it is well worth a visit."
181,5.0,"Based on our experience with other memorials, we only allocated 1 hour when planning our day's itinerary. We ended up extending our time and could easily have spent 4 hours there. There is a large air conditioned museum and outdoor exhibits. Admission free. We learned a lot about the Korean war."
182,5.0,"One of the best museums I have ever stepped foot in. This museum is huge! There is an outdoor exhibit and several exhibits inside. You must see fit yourself, it's a great history lesson, best of all, it's FREE! But please consider giving a donation, it is a very well put together Museum."
183,5.0,It was a great place to visit and I was humbled by all of those who sacrificed to make South Korea what it is today. An awesome place to visit.
184,5.0,"As a person that has traveled extensively and visited lots of museum around the world, this has to be one of top notch museums. I am very interested in history and war, so this was a must visit. The exhibits were very well designed and thought out, there are written information to read, videos to watch, and lots of 3D and 4D exhibits to make you experience and understand the Korean War. I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and learned a lot in several hours. There is also an extensive outdoor museum with displays of previous tanks, aircraft, etc."
185,5.0,"Neither of us knew too much about the Korean war, ok, nothing really, so a visit here was mandatory for us. We got a great introduction of the history of the war and where we are now.  I highly recommend a visit here.  It is very easy to access and also right across from the Dragon Hill Lodge."
186,4.0,We went on Friday which is the day they have various military groups in formal outfits which I found interesting. There are a lot of military planes and equipment. There is a Korean boat that had been shot at. There is a section inside where you can get something to drink. Bathrooms are clean. We were there for about an hour and felt we saw everything.
187,5.0,Good to visit and free . There are lots of planes and tanks outside - mainly American - used in the Korean War . Inside there is a lot of history and very well organised with films . You can see that North and South Korea have battled for a long time and because of the geographical position of Korea it is susceptible to invasion . There also always appears to have been. a Kim in charge of the North . Or some other dictator from Manchuria . It's also about the Korean War and the battle between north and south with the UN intervention . The war lasted between 1950 and 1953 . Korea felt obliged to help in Vietnam . And it seems that participation helped its friendship with the West especially USA . There is a stark warning about nukes and Kim . Good pretzels in the cafe
188,5.0,"It was a great time to explore the history and more attitude. Before that I had watch Yi Sun Shin movie, the Admiral of Navy, he was a clever in the critical time and beat Japanese navy at that time. So, I did find him here. There were many groups of students visited here as sightseeing subject of school."
189,5.0,Very impressive war museum which practicly explaines where is South Korea today with the conflicts in the erea. It is all about wars in Korea in all times. Recomanded.
190,5.0,"Need to expend at least 3 hours for the visit to be worth. The exhibitions are great, particularly the one about the Korean War. The outside sculptures are quite impressive."
191,5.0,"You can spend here a couple of hours, to learn all about the korean history and wars. Very well set up , with some amazing video's and artifects."
192,5.0,We have been to numerous museums in Seoul and this is a definite one to see when in town.  The museum is free and history books were also being handed out on the day we attended.  One of the main points is to thank the United Nations .  This is beyond just the overall general history.  Most displays and videos had Korean and English options.  Got a good sense of what the people in. Korea have gone through over the centuries
193,4.0,"Put this on your to-do list in Seoul.It is a museum with free admission.The statue at the front is inspiring, and it has a huge collection of old tanks and planes and also a ship you can go through (with added dramatic effects).The indoor experience was a bit barren and didn't seem to offer as much as the vehicular display, but I'd say it is worth a visit.In early March 2017 it was not busy at all.Easy to get to via bus #421.We stayed less than 2 hours."
194,5.0,Glad that we went to the War Memorial Of Korea !! The entrance fee was free and there were so many old fighter planes exhibited. We took so many beautiful pictures and all of the planes were still so well maintained. Nice place to visit when in Korea ! Highly recommended !
195,5.0,This museum is very large. My husband and I were unable to see it all due to my bad back and knees. (I cant be on my feet for more than a few hrs.) What we saw was amazing. They have lots of interesting pieces and exhibits. The memorial is a powerful experience. They have outside and indoor exhibits and they are all interesting. You could easily spend a whole day here. Plenty of bathrooms and a few places to grab some quick food (as well as vending machines.) Definitely a must see if you are in Seoul!
196,5.0,"We didn't have much expectation for the War Memorial but were blown away once we got there. It's near the train station so it's very easy to find. There's a lot to see on the outside, we arrived around 6 so didn't have a chance to go inside. We like how the plaques are also in English so we know what the statues mean."
197,5.0,"On a scale of 1-10(excellent), this is an 10+ museum.  My only regret was I thought an hour would be enough to spend at this museum.  Boy, was I wrong.  I regretted going towards the end of the day.  You can spend many hours here and be prepared to be overwhelmed by the excellent exhibits.  Short on time, I thoroughly enjoyed the section ""the UN in the Korean War""."
198,5.0,"This place discusses the history of South Korea's fight for its land. But the huge statues (or whatever they're called) outside the museum itself were mostly about the fight between the North and South. Inside, the museum is divided into three floors (if I remember correctly). It has arrows so one does not get lost. There are vending machine for drinks scattered about the place, as well as water fountains and restrooms. There's a cafe inside as well in one of its floors.Like I said in the title, if you're big on empathy, the areas discussing atrocities of war will get to you.It's a sad place that speaks of truth. ""Freedom is not free."""
199,5.0,Very interesting and plenty of captions in English. The DVDS and the section on UN forces contribution especially good. Highly recommended.
200,5.0,I'd reckon I've likely been to more than a hundred museums in forty something countries. This was the best. Seoul is only second to London worldwide in quality of museums for me. Vital information to understand Korea and what the people have been through.
201,5.0,"If you have interest in war history, you can spend the entire day there. However, a majority of the descriptions are in korean. It is recommended to join a guided tour in English which the memorial provides at certain times and for free, i guess. I saw ticketing booth at the entrance but the booth was closed and nobody was selling nor collecting tickets on my visit. There are 3 floors and the 3rd floor is dedicated to the Korean War. From this visit, i now understand how the war started and how the world stepped in to help via the UN, it was not just the American but they did send the largest troop. Didnt know countries like Ethiopia, South Africa, Columbia, Philippines, Thailand...etc had their troops too in action too.Now I also understand the present conflict between North & South, PRC & US, US & Russia, this conflict went all the way back to how the Korean war started. How Kim Jung Il seek agreement from Stalin & support from Mao Ze Dong to attack the South. How quickly the North overran the South, how ill prepared the South was for this war with almost no credible military assets while the North had been training under the Russians, how the UN stepped in, how they fought back and almost defeated the North, when the troops from PRC join the fight, when they called for cease fire....etc. Interesting to know that there was no winner nor loser in this war, it was only an agreement to ceasefire and a line was drawn to separate the North & South. Good education for the younger generation. It is really touching to learn how many countries step in to help, many of them are still rebuilding after WW 2 which ended about 4yrs prior. It is touching to know many thousands of young soldiers died ""...defending a country they have never seen and people they never knew"" (saw this quote in this exhibit as a tribute to the UN soldiers)."
202,4.0,"It's got a lot of stuff here to see. Most memorably the aircraft, tanks and missiles in the outside exhibit. Of particular interest is the B52, the Mustang fighter and the MiG19 flown from North Korea by a defector. Inside you will find a series of rooms with information and artefacts mainly about the Korean War, but also other periods. Perhaps a little light on details ... But what I liked was the very profound way that the museum was very much a living memorial to those who had died in the war. All done with dignity and respect. Well done"
203,5.0,"Well worth a visit, ensure you visit the war museum which is located nearby the war memorial to learn more regarding the history."
204,5.0,"I learned a lot about the Korean war, info I just didn't know! Highly recommend taking the free guided tour in English!"
205,5.0,"As the sign says FREEDOM IS NOT FREE This museum and showpiece explains the fight and Struggle. South Korea had over the last 60 odd years to be free and to build a vibrant modern industrial country where the living standards have benefited all the people.It has stories of heroism and the  coming together of the nations to support Korea in the their struggle, a terrific museum with the latest Visual aids to show the story in real terms."
206,5.0,"This is an impressive and modern museum covering Korean history from ancient days to modern times. The centerpiece of the museum is a replica of Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle ship. A great deal of the museum is devoted to the Korean War period. Lots of outdoor static display pieces of aircraft, tanks and boats. A must see!"
207,5.0,"There is much more here than just the statue. Impressive area with the monument, several sculptures, a USA plane, etc."
208,5.0,"Lovely palace,  not especially expensive (more so if you're in traditional costume - free entry).  Historical information provided all around the palace and grounds"
209,5.0,"Worth spending an afternoon there. It is huge, so be prepared to walk. It's great for you to learn a bit about the Korean History."
210,5.0,"If you're a sucker for history like me and fascinated by weapons or warfare; then this place is Candy Land! everything was well organized, maintained, kept and complete. I could spend a whole day in this place and it will take a whole day off your itenerary if you want to see everything. it is just HUGE. and the bonus? It's absolutely FREE"
211,5.0,"Well worth a visit if you have a couple of days in Seoul. The externals of the memorial are impressive with static displays, and tributes to all countries that played a part in the Korean war. The artifacts and internal displays are also very good. The overwhelming message of the memorial is one hopeful of peaceful re-unification with the North, which is a feeling you get speaking to most South Koreans."
212,5.0,"We spent a whole day here. There is a coffee shop we can buy lunch. A very worthwhile visit. If you have time, join a DMZ tour to see the situation today."
213,5.0,"museum offers a thorough, engaging review of the many wars which have befallen Korea. We were particularly lucky and pleased that a young university student wanted to practice her English and gave us a guided tour through key parts of the exhibit (this seems to be an offer from the museum management so ask for this when you come in -- it seems they're offered in several languages). The exhibits are exceptionally well done and detailed, giving great context to So Korea's war history."
214,5.0,"We took the English guided tour to begin with. Our guide was very young & skipped over parts that he thought wouldn't be interesting for us (or him) which was fine with us. He told us some interesting stories & then left us to wander around at our own pace. It's a huge place & we loved wandering around taking in what interested us. The displays were really well done both inside & out & we are really glad we visited. Was really valuable especially as we visited the DMZ a couple of days later. Allow a good few hours to really see everything, we stopped for a coffee in the cafe halfway through. A highlight of our week in Seoul."
215,5.0,"Made you understand Freedom is not Free.  Well laid out, very informative, very enjoyable.  Outside displays of airplanes, tanks, missiles and different calibre guns was something special."
216,5.0,"Well worth a visit , is military based but also reflective.Aircraft from the 50s/ 60s , if you want to see a B52 they have one!Inside calm & quiet and tasteful , good cafe .As always in Korea spotless & polite."
217,5.0,"Initially we were planning on doing this museum on our own without a guide but our hotel concierge alerted us to availability of occasional scheduled free English language guided tours so we timed our visit to coincide with this afternoon tour..  But first we visited on our own the somewhat nearby Contemporary History Museum which was a valuable preface to the memorial tour, which ably illustrated how far free Korea has come, from colonial oppression to an underdeveloped impoverished and corrupt third world country to now a leading industrial democratic nation and which is why winning the Korean War was so important in world history.  The guided tour, with many interactive exhibits,  was led, and I was told they are usually led, by retired Korean war army officers, adding to the sense of a living historical experience."
218,5.0,This should be a priority on your itinerary during your visit in Seoul. We spent over 3 hours and we learned a great deal about the history of Korea. The information throughout is explained very well and illustrated clealry through diagrams and interactive resources.
219,5.0,"Lots of walking very informative super static displays. Tanks, cars, planes, wepons, and boats. Many films large place and surprisingly it's free. A must see."
220,5.0,"Although the name suggests a focus on war, the whole exhibition is closer to a step by step of Korean history on the peninsula. Roughly three hours to do the walk through, and then a pleasant stroll around the tanks and aircrafts and ship replicas(commemoration of recent naval incident with North Korea). Tragic pieces of history, but quite romantic at the same time. Remember to be respectful on the compound."
221,5.0,"Its most important historical place, you must visit there, free to enter. There are 4 floors. Really big museum"
222,5.0,"My mother in law list her first husband to this war so this visit ad personal connections. Very tastefully and simply done. We were able to find the name we were looking for immediately. The recognition of foreign soldiers respectful.. Very moving.  Further along is a giant display of military equipment, rather scary and hard to understand.  A few minutes walk from the metro. Husband and I were moved and felt like we have visited the grave of a lost family member."
223,5.0,"Car parking was convenient and walking aroung the memorial was pleasant because the memorial was spacious still well organized. Outside of memorial building you can find the battle ships, air planes, tanks, and missiles. Also you can find the list of names from all of the world who sacrificed their lives for the peace and freedom of Korea. You'd better to wear comfortable shoes because you have to walk a lot to fully explore the memorial. In side of building, you can learn Korean history and watch the 4 D movie. This is place for all people but good for the family with young Kids."
224,4.0,I've been here with my girlfriend Minjung and she told me how is important for the Korean this place.
225,5.0,"I did nt know much about the Korean War.  This museum both enlightened me about it - but also explained some of the way Korea had been created before then (battles with Japan, China and Mongol). It has made me look at Seoul differently since going there."
226,5.0,It was really incredible all the stuffs about the korean war history that was exposed in this museum!
227,4.0,"When visiting other countries, its best to learn its history and local culture and this place is one if your in South Korea."
228,5.0,"We took about 2.5 hours at this musuem. Went for the free English guided tour and our guide was very sweet and gave good commentary. Do join the tour if you can. There was also an outdoor area where you can see ships, planes and tanks used in the wars. Worth a visit!"
229,5.0,"This museum is bigger than I expected! I only thought there would be exhibits covering a fairly recent time period, but the bottom floor of the museum goes back much further in time. There are 3 floors inside, and a variety of monuments and replicas outside. Definitely worth a visit, especially as it is free. Some of the rooms can be a bit repetitive. Overall, the museum is well designed and makes quite good use of technology (many 3D and 4D screenings!), so I think there will be something to capture everyone's attention."
230,4.0,A typical Memorial. A museum is close to it. Easy access via Subway or Bus. Not a must see but good place to go if nothing to do.
231,5.0,"Unbelievable place. The information, art, coffee shop, and outside statues are all amazing. It tells the story of the Korean War through the eyes of the people involved, including almost the whole world. We had planned on half a day, but ended up a whole day there and still felt we missed some of the exhibits. If in Seoul this has to be part of your visit nad be sure to leave enough time."
232,5.0,Museum was free of charge. Easy to find and was very tech savvy. There were informational screens and movie rooms in multiple languages. This was a interesting visit filled with slot of history.
233,4.0,We think it is very interesting to visit the museum inside. Much written and graphic info well prepared.We missed some extra exhibitions that were outdoors previous times we went there. So before going it is useful to check in case you can see them.
234,5.0,"This fee-free museum is a must see for anyone visiting this beautiful country.  While much of the museum concentrates on the Korean War, there are other venues which looks at various other conflicts with particular emphasis on the Korean peninsula.  Everything is in immaculate condition and the employees are very courteous.  Please plan on spending at least two hours for the full experience."
235,5.0,"We read that this is a very good Museum so we traveled quite a bit to Itaewon to visit it. It is grand just from the outside; very large premises with some old/smaller planes, ships and military crafts displayed!. Not replicas but war-weary ones. Just outside the Museum proper is a large podium to commerate and paying tribute to the 20 plus Nations whom has fought alongside S Korea in the 1950s Korean Way.  Flags flew high and it can emotional charging when one moves round to read all the inscriptions, sad stories…It “immortalized” the military history of modern Korea. The memorial building has six indoor exhibition rooms; Memorial Hall, War History, Korean War, Expeditionary Forces Room, ROK Armed Forces Room etc. Displayed are various weapons and equipment from prehistoric times to the modern period as well as paintings of battlefields and sculptures of notable warriors. It is a Memorial to all wars experienced by Korea, including the Vietnam War and Japanese occupation.What a visual treat for a War Museum like this!It was an amazing experience and we were not disappointed having spent close to 3 hours.  And we have not covered everything!! This museum definitely worth a visit.  It is free entry too."
236,5.0,Great place to visit and learn about the Korean War. Very interesting and educational. The museum is very large and will take some time to get through it. Worth checking out
237,5.0,It was a great visit. We spent about 2 hours. There is a short animation movie about the army/ navy which has regular shows. The museum is also very informative.
238,4.0,"This museum is certainly a very interesting place to visit for those interested in military history. It basically covers all the military conflicts Korea's been involved in (with a big part of the museum dedicated to the 1950-1953 war) in a lot of detail. There is a nationalist overtone to the museum, though, that I personally found a bit surprising."
239,5.0,"An important chronological display of the Korean War and all the wars prior in thousands of years of history.An impressive display of artilaries, planes, tanks and warship of different era.Very well designed building in both interior and exterior. Even got a kids playground.Easily to spend 2-3 hours there. Accessible by subway.Best of all, the price is right. "" free  ""."
240,5.0,"I'll be honest, I didn't want to visit another museum. I've been to plenty in my life, but this was one of the most memorable ones for me. My husband and I were in Korea for a few days in October and we walked here from our hotel one afternoon. We spent a good couple of hours walking around. It's free too! I learned so much about the Korean war. It was nice doing this before my husband and I did our DMZ/JSA tour. My favorite exhibit was actually outside the building. It was a depiction of a real life incident of two brothers in the Korean War where they were on opposite sides and reunited in combat. The crack is the separation of the north and south. It symbolizes the Korean wish for reunification. Basically, I would highly recommend walking around this museum. It's very well done without glorifying war and honors those who have fought."
241,5.0,This museum is really great. It is huge. We really enjoyed the way it was broken up into different sections in regards to time of the war. It was very informative and interesting. Highly recommend a visit here.
242,5.0,"This place is huge. Well done sculptures of soldiers outside. Many, many tanks, missiles, planes, etc on display outside. Inside lots of munitions and Kim Il Sung's limo! Some very nicely done dioramas of the Viet Nam war inside. There is a lot to see. When we were there first week of October 2016 we were the all alone. Entry is free."
243,5.0,"This is a must see if you are in Seoul. It's not something I would normally go to but honestly it is so well put together it's worth every minute. It's free but of course you can make a donation. It honours not just the Koreans lost in the war but also the thousands of Americans and mentions every European by name. Very modern and interactive, I thought half an hour would cover it and an hour and a half later we left reluctantly. Very easy to get around so good for young and old alike"
244,5.0,"We had booked the full day DMZ tour with JSA/Panmunjong. My husband has a good history knowledge of the Korean War, but not me. So going to the War Memorial gave me a 'crash course' on the Korean War and added value to our DMZ/JSA tour. We arrived after the English speaking tour had begun, but because we went on Sunday, they have volunteer student guides and one of them took us through the highlights of Level 2 on the Korean War. We then walked Level 3 on our own. We had skipped Level 1 which is on the ancient wars before the Korean War. Outside of the museum in the open space, there is a very good display of exhibits of the airplanes & tanks used in the War. The museum is closed on Monday. Entrance is free. Do check from their website for the timing of the guided tours."
245,5.0,The War memorial of Korea records the suffering of the Koreans during the war. The memorial also record the countries who helped Korea during the wars and their gratefulness is recorded in the Memorial Hall listing the names of those who died from the different countries. The various armaments used have been preserved for the people to be oriented and keeping the history alive. As tourist it is to appreciate their struggle to keep peace and a desire for unification with the help of other countries. It are closed on Monday. Admission is free. to really appreciate do it in a leisurely manner and read the description and history posted.
246,5.0,"We got there in the afternoon of October 21st looking to visit this museum and we were delighted to see that there was also a free performance outside by members of the armed forces and people in traditional costumes marching and performing synchronized moves, fights with historic weapons and dancers in traditional dresses with their musical instruments. The memorial tells the history of Korea from the absolute beginning centuries ago to the independence in the 50's. There are cars, military vehicles and planes on display on the top floor and boats on the bottom one. There are many pictures, artifacts, videos and explanation panels (many only in Korean) that tell the story of battles and struggles of this beautiful country. I believe this is really a highly recommended visit for any tourist coming here."
247,5.0,"We spent 3 hours here and really enjoyed the outside exhibits, statues and memorials. Historically and culturally interesting."
248,5.0,"Spent a whole day at this wonderful museum and could of comeback the next day too. Poignant to see the dedications to all the countries and their soldiers at the front of the museum, as my grandfather served in this war during his national service. very easy to get to and some good eating to be had in the local area."
249,5.0,"The War Memorial is far from the metro station.  Get a taxi.  This is a very organised museum.  Outside there are many planes, army tracks etc with English and Korean labels.  Inside the exhibits are clearly labelled, some very good audio-visual presentations."
250,5.0,"We arrived at 10am to get a tour of the museum by an English speaking guide. Turns out it was a volunteer Grade 10 student who was trying to share information with tourists and practice English at the same time. Kevin, the guide, was very polite and courteous. He spent time with us through many exhibitions, even though he was only supposed to take us through two. He didn't know too much about the actual history, but he was able to offer some translations and also share his personal stories about the war with us. We asked him some questions about North Korea and he provided some very interesting insights!The museum is large, and we could have easily spent over 3 hours there. The exhibitions are very informative and well designed, and certain parts can be very emotional. Great place to learn more about the Korean War and Korean history in general. One of the highlights of our Seoul trip!"
251,5.0,"The memorial itself is impressive, but it also has a park of military plans next to it, which is impressive in itself.Would definitely recommend."
252,5.0,"we spent 2 hours here but could have spent longer if we'd not left it till the end of the day and were tired. Excellent chronology of Korea's conflicts from BC to present day. For the latter stages there are video's, tableaux and plenty of written explanations.  Free to enter but well worth leaving a donation"
253,5.0,"This is by far the best war memorial/museum I have ever been to. I suggest allowing at least half a day (preferably a full day) too see it properly as there is a lot to see, spread over 3 floors. There are 2 cafe's on site if you need a rest and food/coffee. Aside from many fascinating exhibits, there are multiple theatrettes showing short information videos, as well as 2 small cinemas, including one that offers a 4D experience of the battle to recapture Seoul. There is also an interactive photo stand on the upper floor that allows you to take your photo and put it onto a background picture of a soldier or battlefield. There are also memorials to many fallen heroes and tributes to the allied nations who helped the Koreans fight. We were also lucky to also see a military parade in progress outside before entering. Well worth it, and easy to access using public transport. Entry is free."
254,5.0,A huge museum on Korean history and in depth knowledge on the Korean War in 1950s. Lots of interesting artifacts and there is two 4D cinema for you to experience the Korean War.The entrance is free and is about 10 mins walk from the nearest metro subway.
255,5.0,"This museum gives you a glimpse into the war torn History of Korea's past. It helps you to understand why things are the way they are now, the many hurdles they have had to overcome and who the Koreans are on a deeper level.The multitude of exhibits within and without will give your hours of things to explore.And as with most museums in Korea it is free!!!Oh and they have a replica of a Turtle Ship which is a major plus. Even my father who is a major war history buff learned a lot during his visit.A must see in Seoul.Sorry no pictures but the Museum respectfully asks you not to on most of the inner displays and I don't want to steal their ahow"
256,5.0,"Well laid out museum with interesting, thoughtful exhibits. Definitely worth a visit to learn about the history of the Korean War. We especially liked the tanks, airplanes and machinery displayed outside."
257,5.0,"This war memorial is stunning. There is a statue of two soldiers one a South Korean in full army gear, embracing another poorly dressed North Korean soldier, they are brothers. Inside are the countries engraved in bronze with their name and the contribution of men, arms, The roof has a beautiful coloured frieze in an abstract design. The main building has the names of every military person who died fighting to keep South Korea free on bronze columns. In the courtyard are the flags and a monument, flag and contribution of each U.N. country that fought. On the grounds are many planes, guns and tanks, plus a replica of the patrol boat that was attacked by North Koreans  in early 2000. It is amazing only six sailors died when the bullet holes are seen. I left the memorial thinking about all those brave men who fought and died in the name of freedom."
258,5.0,"Very interesting display of tanks and aircrafts from Korean War and from modern times including  a huge B52. A great time to spend with your kids, specially if they are into ""Call of Duty"""
259,5.0,"Ok in all honesty, I've heard of the Korean war but i didn't really know much about it until i came here and boy am i glad that i did. We travelled to this memorial/war museum on our 2nd day in Seoul and it was very easy to get to, i believe we took the subway line to samgakji and walked about 5 minutes up and around the hill where we found it. There was no entrance fee which we found surprising considering the massive size and the attention to historical detail of it all (you literally have nothing to lose here, we would have been more than happy to pay at least 10$ each). There are statues depicting heroic scenes and memorial plaques to commemorate and honour the fallen in battle everywhere. The one thing that really surprised me about it was all the plaques that honoured the foreign soldiers lives that fought and gave their life for the war in Korea, I never knew how many nations were actually involved. Inside there is a museum that holds some of the historical weapons used dating back to periods 2 millennia before the birth of christ, up to modern day weapons used in the most recent conflicts. You will learn about the different korean dynasties, the different wars and conflicts with which nations which ultimately lead to the birth of the modern day Korea."
260,5.0,We went to lots to tourist attractions in the seven days we had in Seoul and I would rate this as one of the best. The old history was really interesting and there was plenty of English commentary to keep us interested. The installations that covered the Korean War were equally interesting and one - I'll call it the tear drop as I have not idea what is actually called - was particularly moving. I'd recommend adding this to your itinerary.
261,5.0,This is a must see if you're very into history of the war that has happened in Korea. We spent about a good couple hours here. Be prepared to walk a lot as this museum is HUGE. The great thing about this place was it was FREE entry. It's very easy to get here as well as we took the subway only about 10 minutes from where we stayed (Tmark Grand Hotel).
262,5.0,If your  old enough to remember the war don't miss it. Every day they have several tours in English and another nice thing admission is free
263,5.0,"Having visited the Korean War Memorial in Washington DC. we wanted to visit the memorial in Seoul. We were not disappointed. It is very impressive! As we emerged from the main building we realised they were preparing for a ceremony, so we found a seat, and at 2pm promptly we watched the Honour Guard Ceremony. It was quite spectacular! So glad we were around to witness it."
264,5.0,"A great place to spend a couple of hours learning about the Korean War. Loads of mock ups and interactive videos which make it all the more interesting, particularly if you have children. There is a great selection of outdoor exhibits too, including military aircraft and vehicles as well as thought provoking statutes. For real history buffs you could easily spend a whole day here, looking at other exhibits too."
265,4.0,"It's free to visit, so why not stop by? Even if you just go for the walk around of the mostly Korean War equipment pieces they have on display outdoors it's worth the 1/2 hour alone.One complaint, if you will, is the thin amount of material on the Korean War. I know, there are 3 entire rooms devoted to it, but in actuality there isn't all that much ( outside of the vast equipment on display outside ). For a country so war torn in it's long history, a visit here gives one perspective and appreciation for what they have gone thru, and, with the help out outside nations, retained- minus, of course, the northern half of the country."
266,5.0,"Korea underwent 50 years of brutal Japanese occupation and then, after WWII, came the Korea War. There is much to remember and it is very well displayed.Access to wheel chairs. Free admission."
267,5.0,"I only had 1.75 hours there which wasn't enough.  I'd recommend at least 3 hours.  Entry is free.  The tanks, planes (including a B-52), missiles, etc. outside of the museum can be seen after the museum closes, so save them for last.  I enjoy my history but this museum still had plenty of interesting information to offer on the Korean war.  It also covers ALL Korean wars from ancient times through to today's military, but the Korean war takes up a lot of real estate as a three part exhibit (give yourself a couple hours for the Korean war exhibit if you have high interest).Some of the exhibits are interactive or moving, plus there is some sound and cinema, to make it a more interesting experience.If you enjoy history at all, you can't miss this museum."
268,4.0,Great museum. Lots of history to read and learn. Free of charge. Easy to get to via subway. Easy to navigate around with English everywhere. Lots to see. Highly recommend if you have a few hours.
269,5.0,this is a very good place go when it rains but anytime is great so many attraction you can enjoy from the past to present great indoor and outdoor exhibits a good place just to chill and watch people it's free
270,4.0,"This is a large complex consisting of seven indoor exhibits including the Memorial Hall (commemorates war heroes and the Korean spirit), War History Room ((depicts some military victories and rocket launchers), Korean War Room I-II (depictnig Korean War of 1950 including a 4D visual experience), Korean War Room III (focusing on role of UN in the Korean War), Expeditionary Forces Room (activities of ROK Armed Forces). There is also a outdoor exhibit in form of the Children's Museum (including a trick art photo zone and guerilla training experience). You can enjoy the Smart Exhibition System service with your phone. The exhibitons are open from 9 am to 6 pm (closed on Mondays), admission is free for permanent exhibits."
271,5.0,"Incredible structure with a fantastic design. Web could not get inside because of a holiday but the yard had a multiple of tanks,planes and boats of both sides"
272,5.0,"Great museum showcasing Korea's military history from ancient times to now. You could easily spend hours reading about all the exhibits. The variety of objects and displays is impressive, and the English translations didn't let them down. We thought the Korean War exhibit with the mock archaeological dig/remains underfoot was especially moving.Only downfall was the cafe & shop. The food is expensive and revolting, and the souvenirs in the shop can be bought elsewhere in touristy shops for half the price. Moral of the story: don't come at lunchtime like we did, there's better food elsewhere!"
273,5.0,"I suggest at least a half-day visit here, because you have both a large museum building and a spacious outdoor area full of planes (including a B-52 bomber), tanks, boats, rockets and artillery pieces.  You are allowed to walk around and enter many of them, so bring your cameras.  The very moving ""Two Brothers"" statue is here, so be sure to look for it and read its story.  The museum building is fine for a rainy day, but try to go on a clear day so you can spend a lot of time outside as well."
274,5.0,"It is a peaceful and relaxing place to visit. It is also good to see the tanks, war vehicles and war planes."
275,4.0,"Impressive monument  & garden display outside the museum. Inside you will find detailed historical displays of various campaigns  along with several planes & military vehicles . Follow along from the outside memorial area, past the museum entry, you will find  a huge outdoor display area of service vehicles, tanks, guns, planes including a B52 bomber."
276,5.0,"As with most Americans, we were guilty of only being aware of Korea starting in 1950.  This was a great history lesson of a country with a long history of civilization. It was a reminder of the statement, ""Freedom isn't free."""
277,5.0,This museum is dedicated to history of war on the Korean peninsula.  It is an invaluable resource to anyone living or visiting the country.  It helps to put the Korean psyche into perspective.
278,4.0,"What a great work of art.  When standing at the monument and looking at it, it is almost if you can feel how these men felt, while fighting the war."
279,3.0,"I wasn't educated on RoK history before husband took me here. The admission is free and the display of the museum was informational. However, it can be a little boring after 2 exhibit halls."
280,5.0,"Awesome place, full of history. RIP to all those heroes who died for their country. I'm from Puerto Rico and was very surprised to see a wall for just for fellow countrymen who died in battle. Very modern facilities, right in the heart of Seoul. Admission is free, perfect of history for anybody interested"
281,4.0,"Located in between the US Army base in Seoul, this museum has a lot to offer in terms of hardware but also many displays of high quality. Although most of the coverage is geared more towards the modern wars, one can find plenty of artifacts and displays of the Korean battles including the famous the Turtle Ship designed and constructed during Admiral Yi's stewardship. This is definitely not the high quality war museum like Canberra, Australia but definitely worth a visit and you can spend hours inside and outside. Some of the planes and tanks, you can actually touch and climb into.  B52 bomber is also displayed in its full majestic self."
282,5.0,It is really Hot in Korea now so a visit now is very cool in their Building...Many interesting things of their past history ...Many Items that apply to their growth and things that the past wars helped to create...Take the whole family something for all to see...Have Fun...
283,5.0,"Easy to walk around the main city center, hectic on business days.  Colorful sights and sounds...wonderful harbor."
284,5.0,Great place to check out if you are interested in history and war in Korea. I was very impressed with the collections. Good place for kids to learn history
285,5.0,"This beautiful, modern museum is absolutely massive. It has everything that you could expect from a museum and much more.It has ancient Korean artifacts, real warships, tanks, weaponry and planes, stunning displays and many interactive exhibits.It does an amazing job of honouring the soldiers from around the world that fought in the Korean war and it explains the history of the war in an excellent manner.On our visit we were lucky to see a demonstration of formal marching and gun handling by a large troupe of soldiers.The museum is opposite the ministry of defence compound which is well fortified and is constantly guarded overhead by an armed helicopter."
286,5.0,You can spend a whole day wandering through this massive modern and interesting war museum (from ancient weapons to 4D movies).  A must when visiting Seoul.
287,5.0,I've always had a facination with war history and this museum will not fail to impress! Amazing collection of war apparatus outside that has been fielded by the Korean army over the past 60 years.  They even have WW2 tanks and vehicles from both the Soviet and American armies. The exhibits inside are really in depth and do a great job at telling the story of the Korean war. We really enjoyed the museum. Don't miss out on this if you're in Seoul!
288,5.0,"One of the most impressive military displays I have seen, A must see for any historians. Covers everything from P-51's to F-4's to B-52's, Mig's, Heavy Artillery pieces to light. An Excellent afternoon well spent.The exterior is Vast and the interior is impressive all to itself."
289,5.0,"As a foreigner living in Korea, I definitely needed to find out more about the history of my new country. This place has amazing artefacts on display, along with a comprehensive story to go with each item on display. The artefact story is written in Hangul, English and Chinese - thus catering for travellers. Furthermore, the museum is very interactive and you can immerse yourself into the Korean War with a 4D presentation of the amphibious landings at Incheon. We spent a little more than 4 hours perusing the museum and were not left disappointed! This is a must-see for anyone visiting Korea!"
290,5.0,"The memorials surrounding the Korean War Museum are works of art that pay tribute to all of the nations that fought in the Korean War as well as seeking reunification between Koreans on both sides of the peninsula.  On the left outside of the museum as you face the museum entrance there are large placards with the names of every Soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for the United Nations Command. They are organized alphabetically and by country (and state for the US). The displays inside the museum provide an accurate and understandable depiction of why the Korean War occurred and the armistice that is still being followed today. The museum curation is world class. There are also numerous documents available for research. Other wars on the Korean peninsula are also covered but my primary interest was the Korean War. I would plan on at least 1-2 hours.  If your a history buff, you could easily spend a day or two. It is a 10 minute walk from the Dragon Hill Lodge and has a subway stop right in front of it.If this review was beneficial, please click the helpful button."
291,5.0,Within my lifetime but before my memories.Very well put together and summarises the various years of the war in a good easy to understand manner
292,5.0,"The display of military equipment outdoors is 'worth the detour' itself, as well as the sculptures and inscriptions.  Inside, the 4D Incheon landing show should not be missed."
293,4.0,"Goes to show: I went in knowing NOTHING about the Korean War, and left completely fascinated.First of all: Free entry! And when you see the size of this thing, thats not something you see everywhere.The information and detail that they give on this devastating time is immense. So much so that I did start skipping rooms I didn't have the energy for anymore.Moral: Give yourself enough time and save up enough energy and this is a spot in Seoul you do NOT want to miss!"
294,5.0,"This is an incredibly informative museum that highlights not only the Korean war, but early Korean military history. The outside of the museum has a memorial and a large number of aircrafts and vehicles. The inside of the museum has 3 floors that are all incredibly informative and talks in detail about the Korean war.As someone who isn't a large fan of museums, I found myself spending 4 hours there without even realising it. This museum is incredibly interesting and a must-do if you are in Seoul."
