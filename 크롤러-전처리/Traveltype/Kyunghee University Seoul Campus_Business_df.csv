0,2.0,"The buildings in the campus are beautiful but in terms of architecture, they are only mocking renaissance-style, like those you would see at the amusement parks. But this campus is packed with visitors during the cherry blossom season. Located a little far from the center. If you are in a tight schedule, I do not see why you must visit this place."
