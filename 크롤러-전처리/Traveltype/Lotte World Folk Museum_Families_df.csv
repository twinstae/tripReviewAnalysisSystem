0,5.0,"to be honest, i wasn’t expecting to be as impressed as i was with the museum, but i am so glad that we paid it a visit in the middle of our trip to the theme park, and i would highly recommend others to do the same.my personal favourite is the miniature zone in the last part of the exhibition where there are tiny, amazingly detailed dollhouse-like displays depicting what korean life was like in the past (attached a few photos in this review). if i had more time i would have tried to look through every single one of the displays. beautifully done."

From pre-historic to the latest dynasty and the modern day - you can learn so much. The life size exhibits are animated and some have narration in different language of your choice. They have really nice replica of the historical buildings, villages, temples, palaces and people way of life. Even the miniature have expressions on their face.   After visiting some of the major attractions such as the seokguram, Gyeongju, and the palaces in Seoul. This scale down summary of all places added more to our understanding. I conclude don’t miss it. Give it a try."

There they enjoyed everything to know about Korean Folk from prehistoric time to modern time. On display are historical clothing, tools, and shelters. We were treated to life size and miniatures dioramas about Korean historical way of life. Displays are extensive and we spent 1 1/2 hours enjoying it. At the end of the displays are shops and restaurants. This is the most memorable Lotte Adventure for my in laws."
3,3.0,Went on a weekday. I think it’s free to entry with Lotte World adventure tickets. Seniors get a discount n children below 3 gets to enter for free. There is performance and activities during the weekends. Do check before u pay to go in.

It used lots of life size models, replica buildings and miniature displays to give you background and visual. The Miniatures were especially fascinating as the showed Korean life in all seasons from the Emperor down to the kids in a village yard. You were able to see different professions at work and how a wedding was celebrated.  When you walk out you are immediately funneled into the traditional Korean Restaurants.  Take the time to visit drop the kids at the park and spend some time alone with the adults of your group."
5,5.0,Great way to learn more about Korea's history. Museum features life-size wax figures and miniature displays that show traditional village life during the ancient times.
6,4.0,The museum includes a large outdoor display and a good sized indoor museum with a range of different displays.  We liked the outdoor area best but it would not recommend visiting in winter.  Food options were minimal.
7,5.0,Is a part of Lotte World. is a nice place where you can see a miniature models about the life of koreean when they has imperial lire. For kids is an interesting place to go. They will enjoy it!
8,3.0,"It's inside Lotte World in Jamsil so don't expect authenticity. For that you need to be outdoors. Still, if you're interested in tasting some old style Korean food and seeing a snapshot of how things used to be, not a bad way to spend and hour or two during your day at Lotte World. Don't expect it to keep your young kids entertained for long, it's not very big."
