0,5.0,A beautiful church perch up the hill. Conveniently located near the popular Myeongdong shopping area. Very peaceful. Well decorated during the Christmas season. A must go to see place when you are at Myeongdong
1,5.0,Very nice and quiet place in the center of Seoul. We discovered it during a Hop-On-Hopp-Off bus tour in the city - which we recommend very much - as you will see all major attractions during the tour.The cathedral is different to European ones but very nice!
2,4.0,"I wandered into the compound of Myeong-dong Catholic Church as I moved out from the shopping alley, looking for my way back to the hotel. It was a Saturday afternoon, the church compound was quite busy with tourists looking for photo spots and some local families and worshippers. As I entered the sanctuary I could sense a peace and calm expected of a place of worship.The cathedral was completed in 1898, built in the Romanesque style, it was quite understated in my opinion compared to the European churches. It is also one of the monuments protected by the conservation law. At the time it was completed, Myeongdong Cathedral was the tallest structure in the neighbourhood and a prominent landmark in Seoul.There is a English service on Sunday morning for non Korean speakers. It was a relaxing moment for me as I took a stroll around the cathedral, reading about the history and people watch."
3,5.0,There's much history in this Cathedral. Lovely cathedral in the midst of a bustling shopping area in Myeongdong.  Quiet sanctuary inside for everyone.  The Gothic architectural design is great and the stained glass windows depict stories of the Bible and the Mysteries of the Rosary.  .  Enjoyed the compound and the surroundings.
4,4.0,The church owns a great spacious area & it is very pleasant break away from the crazy shopping alleys. Very large & pleasant inside.
5,4.0,"extremely clean, calm and quaint on the inside. we went for the 9pm mass and it was beautiful (in korean though)"
6,5.0,"My wife and I are on a month long visit to South Korea.  We planed to visit the Cathedral for Easter Mass.  Great place to visit, easy to find and lots to see.  There are Masses in English, German, French and I believe in Spanish too.  You really don’t need to dress up for the visit (The Koreans don’t).  We went to a Korean Language mass and I had no problems in following it along.  You won’t feel out of place if you are not catholic, everyone is always welcome.  It is worth a 1/2 hour visit anytime I am in Seoul."
7,4.0,"Just a few minute walk from our hotel , we went there for a short prayer. We can't catch the English language mass on a Sunday since we are on a tour group which departs at 8:30 in the morning , yet we arrived late at night as well . Beautiful infrastructure , it can be used for photo taking , and it looks different at night , with the striking lights adorning the church."
8,4.0,"This is a lovely cathedral, landmark for us when navigating Myeongdong market (its easy to get disoriented)"
9,5.0,"The Cathedral of the Good Shepherd in Singapore has an important connection to Myeong-dong Cathedral in Seoul, so it was our calling to finally visit this. There is so much history in this Church, and offers a quiet sanctuary inside for anyone regardless of religions to enter. There is Korean Mass daily but also offers an English Mass every Sunday at 9am. Do also check out the Catholic gift shop inside which offers many items at reasonable prices."
10,5.0,"We last visited the Cathedral four years ago, in a warm summer when the streets around it, famed for their proliferation of cosmetic stores, were full to bursting and the people even seemed to have spilled over into the grounds of the cathedral.This time, in February, everything was much quieter; more serene and more fitting with the feeling of the building itself.Reading in the information leaflet - available from a stand outside the cathedral and also inside, and in a number of languages - when built, the cathedral stood high above the city and could be seen for miles.  These days of course, modern skyscrapers have rather dwarfed it, but you still get a sense that it is imposing and confident.  The church also has a considerable 'campus' around it, of medical centre, hostels etc, which mean that there is space where modernity has been unable to invade.When you consider the average time it takes to build a cathedral and then see that Myeongdong is constructed of standard brick, you have to marvel at the dedication involved in bringing this building to fruition.  It is very attractive, solidly built and looks as if it will be there for centuries to come.You can walk around the whole exterior.  Don't be put off by the main door being shut, you can gain access to the interior by one of the side doors, although this is an active church and you may be interrupting a service or prayer time.Inside the central section is roped off for those who wish to sit quietly in contemplation or prayer.  The usual stations of the cross (quite modern in design, reminiscent of Coventry Cathedral), font etc, although we didn't find the usual place where we could have lit a candle.The interior is simple and beautiful in its simplicity.Well worth a visit, whether you have a faith or not, as this is a real contrast to the bustling, busyness of the rest of the city."
11,5.0,We love the serenity and peace in the church. You can have a quiet rest and say our prayers There are many gift shops inside the church as well. Good location at Myeong dong.
12,4.0,"Since I was celebrating my birthday on a Sunday, we decided to check how to get there. Below the cathedral is LED roses and it was stunning and this is another Kdrama site! We went to an 11am Mass. There were lots of people attending mass (I was surprised, actually)."
13,5.0,after checking out from the hotel. I've decided to walk to Myeong-dong Cathedral through Namdaemun Market. It was great place to visit as you walk through Namdamun Market and Myeongdong
14,5.0,We visited here on Christmas Day. Great atmosphere but it’s crowded. Very near the Myeongdong shopping area.
15,4.0,"Visited as a tourist. Cathedral is a short walk from the Myeong-dong Shopping street. We went just as Sunday evening service was beginning, so didn't get to explore as much as we would have liked. Realized that they offer ""foreigner's mass"" in English on Sunday mornings."
16,5.0,Our vacation was complete after hearing mass at this cathedral. Beautiful and welcoming to tourists.
17,5.0,"Stop by here...quiet timeDon't let the stairs up scare you, there is an elevator for your use.The experience up there was worth the effort"
18,4.0,"Large, but relatively simply Catholic church built in the 1800s. This church had some similarities in design to Notre Dame in Paris, with the tall columns and straight-forward interior design.  Mass was serene and peaceful; a nice change of pace to the busy day.  Most people bowed during the sign of peace.  Surprisingly one Korean lady cut in front of us while going to communion (Really?)"
19,4.0,"We went to mass at the Cathedral and that was a beautiful experience.  But we were hoping there would be more to walk around and see or a self-guided tour, since the Cathedral has a lot of history attached to it.  Maybe is not available on Sunday."
20,5.0,"Very orderly mass arrangement during offering and communion.  They divided into 3-4 sections for people to queue up by row and it was absolutely efficient, no chaos, and very fast.Unfortunately, during Easter Sunday, another mass followed right after our 9am, hence left little time to stay behind to pray to other saints.Beautiful church and the biggest catholic church in Seoul"
21,5.0,"Located in the heart of downtown Seol, Myeong-dong Cathedral is the first parish church of Korea and an important symbol of the Korean Catholic Church.Refreshingly English inside, it was a lovely building.  The stained glass windows were restored by artist Lee Nam-gyu om 1982, the original art work was thought to have been created by the French Benedictine Brothers."
22,5.0,This place made me surprised about silence and space. You can walk around and think about your life. Also there’s a cafe.
23,5.0,"This church is beautiful and has several different services throughout Sunday morning, including an English service at 9 am. It is packed though for every service and people begin lining up outside before a service time because they are scheduled back-to-back ( 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.)There's an underground area associated with the church with art galleries, shopping, and coffee that we went to after the service as well!"
24,4.0,We saw this in passing while going back to our hotel. It looked very pretty and if we had more time then we would have visited the inside.
25,5.0,"My wife and I did not expect to see such a huge Catholic church right smack in the Myeondong shopping street. As Catholics, we were delighted that we could attend Sunday mass which is conducted in English.  Do take note that there are daily masses but the English mass is only on Sunday at 9 am. It is easily accessible via public transport either via the subway train or taxi. For non believers in the religion, this place is beautiful for a short stop visit."
26,5.0,"We went for Sunday mass at this cathedral.  We took subway line 4 and stopped at Myeong-dong Station. Initially we had some trouble locating the entrance and went through an office building to reach it. The entrance is actually located along a side road, off the main Myeong-dong road. It is a very beautiful cathedral of Gothic design and is the centre of catholicism in Korea. We explored the grounds  and it was peaceful. We saw bus loads of tourists visiting."
27,4.0,"We were surprised to see the cathedral right next to this shopping area. There were a couple of English masses so we were able to join and understand. Though beautiful, it is not as ornate as its European counterparts. It is the oldest Catholic church in Korea and holds significant history for the country. It is on a hill at the end of Myeongdong street so it's location is lovely. There are quiet seating areas outside for prayers and meditation. When we were there, a full moon rose up behind the church as the evening mass ended. Stunning!"
28,5.0,"This cathedral is just a few minutes walk from the Royal Hotel where I was staying.  Visited it on my last day.  There is a lot of history and significance for this Cathedral.The bodies of 3 saints (martyred during the religious persecutions in the 1800's) are buried under the alter.  The architecture itself is the first brick church in Korea - built in the Gothic style and is considered a historical site.On a nice sunny day, the backdrop of the church and the architecture of the church is photo opp worthy.  My picture of the church actually has a rainbow that runs across the bottom half of the picture.  I'd like to think that it is a nice hello from the heavens. As you walk into the courtyard of the Cathedral to your left is the grotto of the Blessed Virgin Mary where you can light a candle and pray. Inside is so peaceful and worshippers frequent the church throughout the day."
29,3.0,"Free to visit, Great architecture, please respect those praying inside. If you are into well designed buildings, or religious sites, this is a good one to visit if you are in Myeong-Dong and need a break from all the busy streets."
30,4.0,"It's refreshing to see a Gothic Catheral in the middle of the shopping area. I enjoyed a short walk around it, as I did not think it was open for people to go inside. There were many tourist taking photos from outside."
31,5.0,"for the busy street like myeongdong, you still can find a quiet and peaceful place.. it is myeongdong cathedral. i love i'd been there. it's instagramable for me and my wife. it also have a good architecture and it's so easy to find. (i visit this cathedral on jan 2015)"
32,4.0,"Really well done, right location and perfect view! A little bit strange to see this cathedral in Seoul (at least for me) I was surprised to know that a certain part of people in Korea are catholic. Located on a hill, close to Myeongdong shopping district this cathedral looks awesome, especially in the evening when lights are on. Very modest inside but cozy at the same time. Opened till 21:00 if I am not wrong. Surely worth a visit."
33,5.0,Located on a hill in middle of city...elevators available.Cab driver could not find it!!!!!He had to ask for help 3 times!!!Wanted to buy a cross in gift shop but gift shop closed and is being updated.
34,5.0,"Coming from a predominantly catholic country, I did not expect Seoul to have such a beautiful cathedral as this.  Conveniently located in the heart of Myeongdong , this church has a very nice brick structure with a lot of trees and gardens as well as a nice souvenir shop.  I attended Palm Sunday mass here and it was very solemn.  My only comment is that the pews do not have kneeling pads so its quite diffiult to kneel during the mass. Oh well, its just a small sacrifice to make to make church service more meaningful.  Must visit for Catholic tourists in Korea."
35,5.0,We came across this cathedral during our shopping trips. It is very nicely build with red bricks. We only walked outside the building as the doors are closed. Hope to visit it next time.
36,4.0,Visited this Roman Catholic Church in the middle of Myeongdong since it's just 10 minutes walk from our hotel. Wonderful exterior architecture with red & grey bricks. Love the colourful huge  stained glasses at both side of the wall . It's well maintained as it was completed in 1898. Behind the church there's a small garden with beautiful landscapes & a statue of Virgin Mary . Worth a visit even you are not religious but love the gothic architecture!
37,2.0,"We learned that Korean Catholics number about 10% of South Korea's population. The stained glass was nice but not the most beautiful we've ever seen.  If you're Catholic, they seem to have daily services, which may be important for your religious needs."
38,5.0,"A very big place, and very nice church.  There is also a cafe in the basement, and there are seats around the church, where you can sit."
39,4.0,10am sunday is korean version i thinkthis church is full on a sundayeasy to reach from myeongdong area
40,4.0,"It might look closed, but the doors either side of the main door are quite possibly open. Stain glass windows, alter, and a big organ. Read a bit of the history (free guides in many languages) as it makes it more relevant."
41,4.0,"The craftsmanship of the cathedral is breathtaking.  As you enter, you are just amaze of the beauty.   We went early morning so it very peaceful and it wasn't crowded"
42,3.0,We had difficulty finding the cathedral. It's in the middle of the major shopping district in downtown Seoul and is only reachable from one side. For those who are used to visiting cathedrals in the UK it's a lot smaller  (more large church). However it is a quiet tranquil place in the middle of a bustling city. It is obviously looked after and has information in English so you can recognise the different parts of the building.
43,4.0,"Myeongdong' heart beats faster than most, if you were to seek refuge from the relentless shopping around you there's no where better.  You can walk around the grounds and learn it's over 100years old history, or you can find a cafe in its basement and rest.  There's a bookstore and a gift shop too for your rehab back to the shopping madness."
44,2.0,It is not very spectacular or amazing compared to what you can find in Europe. So my opinion here is probably very biased. It is however impressive to a lot of churches in Korea. It is a niche crowed that would  go and see it.
45,4.0,This place is a must if you're already in Myeongdong Shopping district as this marvel old century structure will amaze you. Perfect ti visit at Nighttime due to many twinkling lights in the cathedral facade. Perfect for picture taking.
46,4.0,"We ran in to the building when we were looking for food in Myeong-dong. They just finished and were distributing calendars for 2017, and there were LED roses when we were walking up the stairs. Great spot for taking pictures. I just peeked into the church where waiting in line for the calendar. The inside was quite normal, similar to other church you would find in Europe. Outside was prettier than the inside."
47,5.0,"The cathedral design is really distinct compared with the high rises and other Korean buildings. From the outside, it looks like a traditional cathedral. Inside the stained glass is especially striking. We visited around Christmastime, and there were carolers on the plaza and white rose lights all around. It was so beautiful! It's very convenient to access if you're in the Myeongdong area. You can even attend mass here if you wish."
48,4.0,"Right in the center of Myeong dongIs this very nice church, not very big but has this something. The ""flower"" garden in front and around which is lighten in the evening is amazing and a magnet for selfies, so for picture taking visit at night."
49,3.0,"The way to the church can be tricky to find if you alight at the station and try to make your way here. The church is nice, and the environment around the main church is nicer. There are also nice cafes at the basement of the building"
50,4.0,"We stopped here on our way back to our hotel. The mass was celebrated in Korean and we attended it quietly and afterwards we wandered around to take pictures. There are beautiful stained glass windows and a massive pipe organ on the second floor. The building is on a hilly part of the city and there are some steep flights of steps to get to it, but don't worry, there's also an elevator."
51,4.0,"We read that this is a must-visit when one is in MyeongDong so we made a trip here on a Thursday evening. The Cathedral is very easy to find once you emerged from Myeongdong Station, a bit to the Northeast direction. You cannot miss this historical landmark that is located in a hilly portion (but you have to cross the flyover). There was no mass held when we reached about 5pm.  One starts admiring the magnificence when we walked up the slope steps leading to the cathedral. The beautifully-architect Gothic design is the 1st parish Church of Korea and also a symbol of Korean Catholic Church.The building structure is awesome and exalt an air of solemnness.  We walked within the vast premise; there are a few annexes each with its own splendor. Do spend time admiring the stained glass windows depicting stories of the Bible, there are also statures and Grotto of Our Lady of Lordes. .Quite unusually and unique that the Cathedral is nestled within the busiest and popular streets of Seoul - Myeongdonmg.  I definitely recommend one to make a trip here, the birthplace for Korea’s catholic community."
52,5.0,This is a nice cathedral to visit.  There are a number of stairs to go up so be wary.  The grounds and cathedral are well kept.  Did not enter the cathedral itself but looked nice from outside.  A worthwhile trip up the stairs if you can do it.
53,4.0,Although it is small but it is great to be here to start your day or after busy shopping.It is worth the visit.
54,5.0,"For a catholic like me, its so fulfilling to find a grand cathedral amidst the city center of Seoul. The Cathedral is awesome with its belfry tower imposing amidst the other buildings around. Since we visited Sept 8, a holy day for the Blessed Virgin Mary, I was so touched seeing school children attending the holy mass. I can say that I Belong -  even when in a foreign country."
55,5.0,we took a walk up the street and came upon this cathedral. there are some lovely marble statutes. There is a small store selling religious books and trinkets. Nice to have a bit of a look around.
56,5.0,"Being a Catholic I find churches when I visit to say mass. This was the start of Christianity in Korea and the church beautifully sits on a hill surrounded by the busiest streets of Seoul. The mass. beautifully presented but also showed a variation for Koreans. Though a small Cathedral, its historical significance can be truly felt and understood."
57,4.0,Unexpected there is such a beautiful holy cathedral in this popular shopping area.  The building structure is awesome.  It is so quiet and peaceful inside.  I love to pay a visit here after do crazy shopping.
58,5.0,Surprising to find this cathedral in the midst of the busiest shopping mecca of Seoul.  The complex including the church is astonishing and the service we attended was packed.  The architecture is inspiring.  We totally enjoyed it.
59,5.0,Worth a visit! And especially special since I'm a Catholic. Cathedral is big with a gift shop and there's another section of the building where it's air conditioned with cafes and all.
60,5.0,"The cathedral is beautiful and big. If going shopping in Myeong dong, it s worth to visit the cathedral. It s warm inside as there is no ac. Don't forget to look at the front door as it s different from others"
61,5.0,We went for the English service on Sunday morning. It was gorgeous. We met the Irish priest afterward and he told me my husband was my better half...first time we've heard that. Haha.
62,5.0,"You are greeted on the sidewalks leading up to the cathedral by member of the church handing out holy water and holy cards and murmuring ""God Bless You.""  Nice!  There was a wedding going on there when we were there so we couldn't go up to the altar but it is a lovely church"
63,4.0,"I dislike the Myeong-dong area as it is just an area filled with overpriced stores selling luxury goods and catering to wealthy Chinese customers with money to burn. However, this church and the nearby visitor's center make the district worth a quick tour. The church is one of the finest pieces of historical western architecture in Seoul. Compared to European churches, it is not amazing but it is the most beautiful church in Seoul. For people that love shopping, this place makes a convenient stop on the way to the stores in the area."
64,3.0,"just a regular cathedral nothing special inside or out, i expected to see some asian influence but apart from the cast iron work on the main doors there's nothing at all..."
65,5.0,"We attended the morning English mass on Sunday and the atmosphere was one that I would cherish. The cathedral carries the voice of the choir through the whole place and its amazing!!! For non-catholics, it is a nice place to visit as it is well-kept and there are loads of photo opportunities!!!"
66,5.0,Beautifully stands in Myeongdong.  A landmark of history and to witness how the missionaries contributed to the development of the city.
67,4.0,"I was staying in Myeongdong area during my trip so I thought I would pay a visit, a pretty little place :) If you happened to be in the area I would recommend a little detour to come here."
68,4.0,This cathedral though not as impressive with European standards has a lot of meaning for the start of the Catholic faith in Korea and it is clear that it is well loved. It is definitely worth a walk around. Also very close to combine with visit to the famous shopping street adjacent to it.
69,4.0,nice architecture and peaceful in the midst of the busy myeongdong. interesting to see korean painting of Jesus with people in Korean traditional clothings
70,5.0,"We claimed the many steps to the Cathedral. When we went inside there was a ceremony of the priests going on, so we sat and watched this. It was something that I had never seen before. The Cathedral is beautiful inside and very calm."
71,3.0,"The church is at the Myeongdong shopping area and it is not hard to find. The architectural is similar with others Catholic Cathedral,but it is nice place to see while you are spend your time at Myeongdong."
72,4.0,"I wanted to visit this Cathedral especially because it is in Asia. In Asia, you will visit religious sites and it will be Buddhist Temples. I am not Catholic but I still like to visit Holy Sites. It’s kind of odd to be placed next to a section in town where there is nothing but shopping but it would be a little more awkward say if it was in Hongdae where there are mostly bars. In any case, it is very easy to find as you continue walking straight as you get out exit 9, walk 5 minutes and you’re there. We went at night and I was thinking of just taking photos of the beautiful building at night but to my surprise it was open for Mass. I looked inside and stood in the back and took a couple of pics. I’ve seen nicer churches but this one was still special in its own way and I was glad to witness mass there."
73,5.0,Probably one of the oldest church in the country. The church is beautifully preserved esp the pipe organ that greets the tourists and devotees alike. The interior is as beautiful as the exterior. One can spend some quiet time inside while admiring its beauty.
74,1.0,"If you have been to Europe , then don't bother there is really nothing much to see. Just very peaceful and the area is small.Not much write up as well."
75,5.0,"Grand view of the cathedral and it sounding of the modern building.  Quiet and well kept building make you feel the sincerity of the worshiper.  Don't miss this when in Myeongdong, both morning and night view is beautiful."
76,3.0,Located in Down Town and as it has many tourist attractions near by so if you visiting any of those you won’t miss the Cathedral.Hanok village the most popular is one of the nearby spot.Good for visiting!
77,5.0,"Didn't get a chance to go inside, there was a funeral going on. It is a nice walk from our hotel - a must stop for any visiting Catholic."
78,5.0,"Myeong-dong Cathedral offers peace and tranquillity among the noise and buzz of Myeong-dong hyper-shopping district.  There are 10 masses on sunday, with only the 9am mass in English."
79,4.0,A quite place sitting down to admire the place which is very lovely. At the far end of Myeongdong shopping mall.
80,3.0,"Though the cathedral itself is very samey and nothing too special compared to other cathedrals, the steeple is lit up nicely yet forebodingly at night, and the location next to the shopping district of Myeongdong and an underground area - which itself includes a pretty nice coffee place - is good. It was interesting to open up one of the books and read some of the song verses in Korean, though."
81,4.0,a nice and quiet place to pray for the catholic although located very near to the myeong dong shopping area.
82,4.0,"Beautiful cathedral. If you head underground at the entrance to the grounds, there is a bit of a coffee shop/restaurant complex. Coming up onto the main grounds of the cathedral you can see the building and the other smaller buildings of the grounds. We didn't get a chance to go in as mass was being held when we visited but it is a great place to photograph and pamphlets in various languages provide some history and insight into this landmark."
83,5.0,"The brief history notes it was built on top of the hill so it was easily seen 100 years ago.  Now it's more blocked by buildings, but our guidebook and human visitor guides posted at the street entrance of the nearby shopping district point the way easily.  Great gothic architecture and appears well-maintained.  So many nuns walking all about as well!  There are at least two bookstores nearby.  If you go in the summertime walk down the uneven steps through the garden and see the butterflies.  Very peaceful place to visit."
84,4.0,"We visited at night and the church looks stunning. Built with bricks and high walls, the lights at night made it more spectacular. It was quiet and peaceful and it was a nice place to sit and simply stare at its beauty."
85,5.0,"Attended Mass at 11am on Sunday during our visit. The Cathedral was full and more to our surprise, by mid-day as we were leaving it was full for the following service. We were told the other services held on Sunday were usually all full. Even more amazing was that each service was supported by its own choir and music unlike England where usually only one service has music of the standard we experienced in Seoul. The Cathedral itself is Gothic in style but built in brick which is interesting. The stained glass is well worth looking at during your visit. There are two ways to approach the building, You can walk around the road and walk up the steps. However if you find that a bit daunting, you can take the lift which is approached from round the side. This brings you out directly in front of the Cathedral entrance. We came this way having spotted a couple of nuns leaving the subway station and guessed they would know the way. As it was, since it was Sunday, we only had to follow them! (If you wish to attend Mass in English you need to be there at 9am)"
86,4.0,"Located on slope. Would considered in convenient place. Shops, shopping all near-by. Vast compound in the cathedral - several buildings. Love the sweet grotto. Attended the Sunday mass."
87,4.0,"This is a nice cathedral.  Perhaps it can not hold a candle to some of the great cathedrals in Europe, but when you take into account the stark contrast of the ultra dense population of Seoul, the modern buildings of an Asian metropolis, and the fact that Korea (even till this day) is not heavily Christian, the beauty and majestic nature of this structure really hits you.  Additionally it is a little green space in the middle of the city!"
88,4.0,Place was small but still you could really feel calm and peaceful just going inside the premises. The glass panels were very elaborate and beautiful. Went there on a monday afternoon though so their was no mass during that time. We said our prayers and admired the serenity of the place.
89,4.0,It's a gorgeous church build in the late 1800. The church is well-maintained with passional congregation. This location should be in the list for a Catholic as you'll want to experience the Sunday mass.
