3,4.0,"Insadong was highly recommended as a must-go destination in our September trip to Seoul.  So in our recent holiday to Seoul, we took a train to Insadong on a Sunday afternoon.It is a small but lively district with many alleys that are lined with art galleries and shops selling traditional goods , antique , art collections of porcelain & ceramic, handmade crafts  and also fashion wears and many traditional tea shops and cafe.  Insadong is a vibrant artistic hub where one can get to see unique folk crafts and artisans at work in their niches and  also many street food vendors selling traditional korean snacks. I was very happy to get five  pieces of  lovely handmade hairclips and a toy gun in one of the alleys.There was also street performance on its pedestrianised main street to entertain the locals and tourists. We enjoyed strolling along the different alleys and browsed the shops and different knick knacks. In one of the alleys, we saw Dam Steak & pasta. We decided to try a western meal for lunch after several Korean meals. Dam was a nice cafe with good ambience and we had a peaceful meal after a good walk and browsing and shopping."

8,4.0,"Nice street with ceramic products of tea pots/cups and local souvenirs.  Plenty of restaurants,  they even offered English menu.  There is a nice tiny tea museum off the path. Their tea are medicinal so ingest wisely.  If you never had traditional tea before,  safer to try in small sips. My friend inhaled hers within minutes and was nauseated a short while later. Getting here by taxi can be a pain because traffic here is bumper to bumper at most times of the day. Subway is much faster and cheaper."
9,3.0,"Interesting place to visit but not on hot day. No cover except into those tiny shops-  do drop into a few interesting shops esp the Michelin Traditional teahouse on Insadong. Great place to have korean tea, coffee, snacks and lots of photos"

16,5.0,Good place to buy souvenirs with many restautants (incl. fantastic vegan ones)  great cafes ans tea houses. Close to many other touristic spots.
17,5.0,"Love to walk Insadong gil.  It is not quite a pedestrian only as there are delivery vehicles and taxis passing thru during the day, but pure pedestrian after a certain hour in the afternoon.  It is very crowded but still enjoyable to walk thru and experience the many shops, restaurants and gift shops.  Be sure to walk the many side alleyways, which are filled with restaurants and shops.  It is very safe.  Most of Insadong gil is smoke free another good feature.  And eventhough some areas are cobblestone, it is pretty much flat and straight for wheelchair accessiblity."
18,5.0,"Definitely one of my favorite places in Seoul! You can definitely feel the traditional and cultural atmosphere here. Lots and lots of souvenirs for you to choose from ranging from affordable to slightly pricey. Also, tons of unique, handmade stuffs you can buy to bring home.

Just remember to wear comfy shoes :) Once you're done with the main street, you can also walk around the area which has plenty of sightseeing with traditional shops, temples, etc."

Very clean place"
20,4.0,"We were just strolling around the area for some food and a Korean friend recommended this old but nice small restaurant which serves korean traditional snacks..There are traditional items sold in the stores like antique stuffs or wood carvings..You can also buy souvenirs at a low cost, you can make bargains if you buy more..There are also modern pubs and restaurants in the area.What I didn't like is that people are smoking every alley.

28,4.0,"I have been back to Insadong several times over the last several years. Over the past three visits I have seen more of the galleries and fine art places disappear and more places selling tourist stuff. Still there are places with beautiful art and crafts. I found a Chinese style teapot in a cream glaze with fabulous grey craqueleur. It was not cheap but it is not something you are likely to find anywhere else. Every time I have come here and wandered the streets, I have found something unique. So it is still worth visiting, tourists and all. There are any number of tea and coffee places, traditional Korean restaurants, and, if your are vegetarian, one famous vegan place specialising in Korean temple food, Sanchon. I do plan to return next visit."
29,5.0,"This was right behind our hotel. There are many shops, resturants, tea houses and more. There was almost too many options to eat. We found food stalls and a lot of traditional resturants slightly off the beayen path. Not to mention the galleries and museums."

36,4.0,"A lovely place to stroll through looking for both locally made unusual and typical souvenirs. It's typically very much full of western, English speaking tourists, but many of the sellers and stall holders do not speak great English, so be prepared to have your translation book/app out - all park of the experience!If it's time for a meal, be sure to check out the streets and alleys that run off the sides of the main, as they offer great local and international foods at bargain prices!"

38,5.0,"We experienced the hanbok rental (traditional clothing).  Girls rent the traditional clothing at a cost of about $150US!  They wear tennis shoes under the dresses and take phone photos of each other in various poses.  The back of the head is often more photographed than the face, or so I saw.  Shopping is good quality and pricing."

It was delicious, but very sweet."

58,5.0,I love this area because this is where the Ibis Ambassador Hotel is! I love the little bars and shops! Best place if you want a small place to hangout with friends.
59,5.0,"Insadong street was very close to our hotel and we just loved exploring it! Don't miss Bukchon Handmade Dumplings, Insa Main Branch. It is famous with the locals and it was a bit hard to find but we asked someone, and this typically friendly and helpful Korean lady brought us two blocks out of her way right to the door of this fabulous place. It's very small, maybe 20 seats tops, and you can have fried or steamed dumplings of many descriptions. After that, we had so much fun exploring the shops. Most of all, we loved the alleyways - mysterious and inviting and totally safe at any time of day or night! Seoul is one of the safest big cities in the world and the people of Seoul are incredibly hospitable and friendly. Multiple times a day we were asked on the street if we needed help finding an address, or getting a taxi, and if we asked someone for directions, they led us straight to the place. Unbelievable. Insadong Street shops have better prices than Myeongdong. We saw someone singing and playing the guitar and another guy playing a steel drum. The vibe is casual and friendly. Found some great treasures, and great food. Don't miss it!"
60,5.0,Lovely street to hunt for traditional Korean art.  Insadong is also the place where the young and upcoming designers showcase their work.  Lots of good food and cafes too.

63,4.0,"After a full day of business meetings, this was a really nice change of pace, interesting shops, casual walk and chance to wander in and look at shops.  I especially liked the shops displaying the artworks displaying Korean scenes like village life and community scenes, all done by Korean artists. They are unique and elegant and employ a range of colours that stand out in the normal beige and brown colour palette of Korea."
64,3.0,"Insadong used to be a great place to visit; small production artisans practicing their craft and selling their wares at a terrific price since there was a lack of middlemen, restaurants that were painstakingly true to the roots of the dishes they prepared, and when the sun went down, a nice local nightlife offering a variety of drinks and food at reasonable prices where people can sit and talk for hours.Then the rents started to go up and the artisans were forced out and replaced by shops selling inferior products of lower quality. The interesting mom and pop restaurants went away in search of cheaper rent. The nightlife got glitzed and glammed for the tourist dollars that always seemed to grow yearly. Analytics have determined what you want to buy and marketers have designed this product mix or maximum return on investment.That's not to say all the shops are gone but the neighborhood has definitely turned a corner and it is more tourist trap than artisan collection.There are still some famous old restaurants at the edges of Insadong that are worth checking out so the general area isn't such a wash.If you visit, Insadong, it will be interesting but not the place of its reputation, at least not any more."
65,4.0,"Very busy, all sorts of shops, small but good restaurants. All explorable on foot and within a reasonable time span."

67,2.0,"I lived in Seoul 20 years ago and Insadong was a charming area with traditional tea shops, artisans, and restaurants, all houses in traditional buildings. I was shocked to see what it has become. Many of the traditional buildings are gone and there are so many shops, mostly selling junk. It was almost unrecognizable and a huge disappointment. A victim of its own success i guess."
68,5.0,"While touristy, it is still a great spot for shopping and just enjoying Seoul. Street food was excellent."
69,5.0,"Insadong at first seems like a huge tourist trap full of packed souvenir shops, but if you venture down the alleyways in search of a hanok tea house you will be transported back in time! Also check out a really cool shop with stamped maps from the 1500’s!"
70,4.0,"Very fun street - definitely worth a quick stroll, and you should check out Ssamzigil shopping center - but definitely feels a bit touristy. If you're trying to buy non-touristy knickknacks, I'd recommend checking out other spots."

I had Black sesame rice cake with my cold tea. Notice while being there the Apricot trees around your table.  SEE card address in photos..Dragon's beard candy The DRAGON Moustache is a great gift for family if you are visiting Seoul. It is a delicate candy and mildly sweet in flavor.  It is called Dragon's beard candy (or Chinese cotton candy). Mr. Uki is the master of making this delicate candy; he creates thousands of white shredders out of hard honey in seconds.

Neat gifts for taking home plus art galleries and places for grabbing a snack or a meal. Way better than a food court with a huge selection to choose from.

We are food nerds so we totally enjoyed everything kimchi, xoxo."

120,3.0,"The place looked fairly plain, which was a bit of a let down for a place that is supposed to be a hotspot of art in Seoul. The shops sold mainly traditional souvenirs, so it may not appeal to all types of shoppers. There was also not much activity in the area, although this could be due to the fact that it was raining when we visited."

127,5.0,"I have written about Insadong twice, so you can read those reviews to see exactly how to get to the Insadong area and location.  Most of my last reviews ares still pertinent today.  It can be very crowded, but being a mostly pedestrian street, some vehicle pass thru, it can be as casual as you want to make it.  Gyoja for dumplings is great, Starbucks is as usual, very crowded on all three floors.  Many small shops with hand made one of a kinds and of course souvenirs.  Also, try the finely whipped honey candy.  See my pics.  Enjoy it."

But there were some fun surprised like a hand made treat out of honey, starch and almonds that looks very interesting.  A lot of calligraphy stores and stamp stores as well.  A fun place to take a walk."
137,4.0,"I have been visiting Insadong for more than ten years.  While it has changed a great deal, it is still a charming and unique neighborhood.  Lots of galleries that change exhibits every week so there is always something new to see.  Amazing shopping and the places to eat are endless.  My favorites are the little places tucked away in the side streets.  Unique jewelry in various price points.  This has become a very popular place with locals as well as tourists so can be crowded but worth it."
138,4.0,"Wandering and being lost in the side streets and alleys of Insadong as we searched for eateries, art and gift shops made for lots of steps but some interesting finds in this tourist area of Seoul.  We looked for some unique treats to take home and ended up buying a candy called ""Dragon's Beard"". The sample tasted pretty good but wasn't as tasty as expected when eaten at home. We found the biggest selection of souvenirs and gifts at Insadong, but the nicest quality items were in the gift shop of the  national museum by Gyeongbokgung Palace."
139,3.0,"Insadong used to be one of my favorite places in Seoul. Whenever there are new visitors from overseas, I used to bring them to Insadong and they all loved it. But recently, the rents got so high and many shops which were in Insadong for ages moved out of Insadong. Small souvenirs from the shops there now cost fortune. Honestly, Insadong is losing what makes it very special. It's no longer Insadong I used to know.What a shame~"

Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to bump into a cultural experience, like dancers or musicians performing, or a calligrapher demonstrating his craft. You really need to allow a few hours minimum to absorb the magic this area has to offer! Also, on my last visit, the latest trend seems to be Hanbok (traditional dress) rental & you'll see loads of (mostly lovely young female) tourists all bedecked, some including hairstyle, matching bag and shoes! It seemed most prevalent among the Japanese, who love a good costume. At any rate, it adds to the charm and historic feel of the area, which is already quite easy to love."

161,5.0,I love Insadong area because of the shop stalls along the streets and the street foods. If you want to buy something for your friends wayback home just go and shop at Insadong. You can just walk from Buckon Village and Gyeongbukgong Palace. Just ask for direction from the people you meet.

163,3.0,"A growing number of foreigners are enjoying Korean food, music, and movies. The entire area is filled with a lot of culture and art. Insa-dong is a blend of modern and traditional things. Insa-dong is a very popular area in Seoul. BUT! I wouldn't visit this place that if I was you. This street isn’t so special any more."
164,4.0,Lots of restaurants. Street vendors and shops. Convenient location near the palace. My favorite stop was Dr Fish. Pay a small fee and stick your bare feet into an aquarium with fish which eat the dead skin off your feet. Tickles a bit but your feet end up smooth and clean
165,5.0,"My mother and I went here together and we absolutely loved it! We had visited a couple of the other markets together and they were somewhat of a letdown because we weren't really looking for that department store feel or the super back alley pawn shops that were behind the department stores. We wanted the in between that was street vendors and street level shops with decent wares at decent prices and that is precisely what Insadong was. It had great things to buy and look at and it was just a lovely place to walk around. The street was blocked off so there was only foot traffic, very few cars. Just beware that the stores close around 8:30 p.m. or so!"
166,4.0,"Visited this street in May. This market is one of major tourist attraction. You can buy clothing, souvenirs, and food as well. Walk-able from the palace. Dont forget to try Temple food restaurant in this area."

172,4.0,"It's a good place to buy traditional souvenirs and eat varieties of korean foods (including traditional teas and dessers!) Especially I recommend old tea houses and traditional dessert shops around the town. Most of them are using the old Hanok's building, so you can enjoy your tea in the peaceful and silent Hanok. ;-) Some say Insa-dong has now become too commercial, but it's still one of the best places to feel traditional Korean mood."
173,5.0,"Insadong was a great combination of craft/souvenir shopping, tea houses, places to eat, and galleries.  I have already had 2 fabulous meals there, bought super souvenirs and had the best experience - which involved buying a new handbag, and leaving all my jewellery in the old handbag at the shop.  Naturally, when I realised, I returned the next day;  I was recognised on sight (!!) and she raced to the back of the shop to retrieve not just my jewellery but several special pens that I didn't even realise I'd also lost!"

177,4.0,"After experiencing the pedestrian-friendly street of Hongdae, Insadong felt more like a street made specifically for tourists.

203,4.0,"We were here for lunch at a well known traditional lunch box place - but the highlight of our evening was when we made the impromptu decision to try the ""hanbok experience""There are many stores in the area renting out Hanboks - most of them help to dress you, do some simple hairstyling and you can walk around the area for 2-4hrs at different charges. We'd recommend browsing a few stores because some of them have really pretty ones that would be a shame if you missed them! We finally settled on one that was on the 3rd floor (look out for an orange hanbok display at the ground level and walk up the stairs). This shop had a beautiful collection of traditional and special hanbok designs. The ladies there were friendly and really hospitable. We were dressed and got our hair styled by an elderly lady who was very gentle and friendly. We walked around the entire area (feel free to roam as far as you'd like for some picture perfect shots) and came back to return our hanbok and hair accessories after 2 hours. The shop is safe with lockers for you to leave your belongings, just remember to bring some money with you in case you want to shop along the way. There are loads of souvenir stores and F&B options around the area so have fun!"

Nice little walk, several side street restaurants. Close to other ""attractions"" so a good stop. There were stores with beautiful hanboks, and traditional papers. We also saw tea and traditional and newer crafts shops. Make sure to stop in at Ssamzie-gil to browse the stores and have what tastes like bungeoppang (sweet fish shaped red bean pancake) but with a shape twist.

Insadong is a wonderful neighborhood to explore, and lends itself to leisurely wandering. For lunch, we ducked into a basement restaurant full of Koreans, where chefs were making delicious, fresh mandu (potsticker type dumplings). We also happened upon a lovely, traditional tea house in an alley, where we enjoyed various teas and desserts. In the evening, street food vendors come out of the woodwork. There are countless stores to peruse at all price points, with merchandise including clothing, ceramics, jewelry, art, tourist trinkets, and more.

I have a special love for Insadong because my mom worked at a ceramics shop on this street back in the early 80s.  We recently went back to that same shop and I say that only happened because it was Insadong.  There is so much history here, not just in the type of items that are sold here but the shop owners and artists that are here as well.

Another quick cup of rose latte maybe?Also of note are the costume shops you'll see here and there where you can rent a traditional hanbok and walk around in it for the day.  Going to the nearby palace in one might be a fun picture opportunity."

With the many teahouse, tradiotional and new, there'll always be a place where you can relax over a cup of tea. The many restaurants offer for reasonable prices a complete typical Korean meal. At some of them you may have to queu to have a seat during peak time. There are many artshops with paintings and supply shops for the typical Korean papercraft, calligraphy and painting. Streetartists give the right ambience to the place. The area is easily accessible through public transport (subway or bus)"
222,4.0,When we finished at the palace we walked down this street. Loads of food places in old style wooden buildings. Loads of shops selling souvenirs too.
223,4.0,A lot of street food and souvenirs. Go in the evening to enjoy the street food. A lot of shops selling souvenirs as well.
224,5.0,"Go crazy over all the souvenirs to choose from. They offer souvenirs in bundles and you can even get discount and freebies if you buy in bulk. Try exploring the whole district and be amazed by all the handcrafted items you can shop. From paintings to clothes and small crafts, everything in Insadong was very artsy and preppy. Another thing I enjoyed here was the tea shops. You can find O'Sulloc and other tea shops that offer different kinds of tea and sets to bring home to your loved ones or to add in your collection."
225,5.0,"After going to Gyeongbokgung, you can go here and buy some souvenirs. I would say that buying Korean souvenirs here would be the cheapest and most complete place to be. You can also ask for a discount by saying (kakajuseyo) and the vendor will give you 1000 until 3000 won discount. Sometimes they will give you free stuff if you buy a lot."
226,5.0,"Dont be fooled by the usual description of Insadong being the gatekeeper of traditional trades.. The Insadong of today has plenty more than that.. The numerous galleries that line its streets are worth popping by for orginal works. Nib into the many side alleys for lunch/dinner and you won't be disappointed for sure! We had lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant coz we got caught in a sudden downpour and we weren't disappointed at all! I can't remember hw or which alley tht is anymore.. But I'm sure you could try and google '+84 Tea Coffee Drinks restaurant' and you should be avle to find directions. If Vietnamese food ain't your cup of tea, look out for O'Sulloc Teahouse! The green tea rolls are to die for.."
227,4.0,"Insadong is the arts district of Seoul. Home to art galleries, street demonstrations and tea shops. It's a fun place to walk around and soak up the culture. It's full of people in traditional dress showing how to make art or traditional Korean food. Also a great place to pick up some souvenirs. The restaurants are nice but a bit pricey."
228,5.0,"I really love the place , a lot of people , many traditional Korean things , a lot of Korean wearing the Korean traditional clothes , the people is nice , the place is woow , many Korean things to buy , clothes , sweets , Korean stamps, if you pass by Seoul you need to visit this market and place ,one of the most popular and perfect place in Korea"
229,5.0,This place in my opinion is probably the most important street to visit in Seoul. It gives you the traditional side of the culture in Seoul.
230,5.0,"Its is a vibrant street filled with traditional tea shops, souvenir and clothes/accessories. Had lunch in a vegan restaurant in one of the numerous alleyways."
231,4.0,"as recommended by my friend, this is the place you could get souvenirs for your friends/colleagues back home as they are selling in bulk of 10 or in singles e.g. korea related keychains, fridge magnets, chopsticks, etc. bought a few myself as wellif you look carefully, the names of the shops in Insadong are named in korean, e.g. for Starbucks, instead of having the name Starbucks shown on the shopfront, it was written in korean. and this are also seen in other English named shops, so this is pretty cool to me. (:"
232,4.0,"Love Insadong - it wasn't cheap by any standards but we enjoyed the eclectic mix of shops, including the handmade jewellery, home accessories and street foods. We picked up some handicrafts, a couple of accessories and fresh snacks, then noshed on street food like the 'doodie' buns (shaped like poop, I kid you not) and the deep fried buns filled with honey caramel and nuts. Worth a visit at least once and made for interesting window shopping"
233,4.0,We enjoyed browsing all the tiny shops and seeing some of the traditional Korean crafts - we purchased some beautiful patchwork bags and table runners to take home. Prices were quite reasonable.
234,5.0,It was like love at the first sight!! I'm loving Insadong because of it's uniqueness. Even wall with fall leaves look pretty. All stores here are written in Hangul and there were a lot of locals went here using Hanbok. Soooo lovely ❤

236,5.0,"Insadong is the cultural centre of Seoul and where the Changdeokgung is. We fell in love with the ceramic shops, art galleries, cafes and artisan shops. Highly recomended!"
237,5.0,"Not your typical Korean shopping street - mainly because of its multiple side alleys. The best things about these alleys are the hidden restaurants. And they serve superb food. Mostly locals at the restaurants, and some are so small that they seat about 4-6 tables and they are full.Shopping is great too - mostly artsy stuff and souvenirs."
238,5.0,"Very beautiful street to shop for Korean traditional things quite crowded but we really enjoyed it Highly recommended but remember never settle for the first price you get , I got over 20k discount"
239,4.0,equivalent shopping street but here offer more variety and can find some surprise in the alley. Able to find some local stall here. We had the cheapest korean food here through out the trip in one of the local stall in the alley.
240,4.0,"Interesting place with this lovely combination of old times dwellings with modern life stuff. A very international street, so when I was looking for some places the foreigners would pont me that place out ))) Lots of restaurants and places to relax. I found here quite cheap lodging, and it was good even by the local standards."
241,3.0,Insadong is a pedestrianized shopping area consisting of a main street and several alleyways.It is a touristy area and there are a number of art and antique type shops as well as the usual souvenir shops.There are a number of restaurants and coffee shops. It is worth a stroll but it is not really ideal for serious shopping.
242,5.0,It is just as like other shopping streets..have local foods..traditional sourvenir shops..galleries..you can walk along the street if you want to.. for me.. no cheap sourvenir there.. ~gudluck guys
243,5.0,"While walking along this street, u will find shops selling more accessories and local designer clothings. It's quite different from other shopping streets. U will find Ssamzigil Insading which is a small building with many small shops selling interesting goods. Worth to visit for different feel."
244,3.0,"Good place for serious art lovers but touristy price.  Good for a walk and eat.  I just recommend to eat on restaurant when you wish to use restroom/toilet.  At the time I used the restroom, toilet tissues were piled up on trash can and has wet floor....uuugghh..  Looks like no one regularly maintains them...but they call this tourist place?"
245,4.0,"Some items are a bit pricey, great variety of food. Great for late night strolls with friends, and it's also a great place if you want to buy some souvenirs."
246,5.0,"One of my top 5 places to visit in Seoul. Not only is there a main street of antiques and a souvenir shops, be sure to visit the branching alleys for restaurants,  cafes, tea houses.  Osullec is the famous teahouse, but do try the smaller ones, especially those located upstairs. Unfortunately these only have Korean characters so I could not read it or have non descriptive names like Tea cafe (?) So just be adventurous, my companion and I were never dissapointed. We went back to Insadong several times to try different ones. There are 2 buildings filled which many, many small shops where you can window shop from floor to floor without climbing stairs. It sort of spirals it's way up with an inclined ramp. Really neat place."
247,5.0,"Love the place! So many interesting stuff to see. This is where I rented a Hanbok for 15,000 won for 4 hours. I also had my illustration (drawing) done here for 15,000 won too. There are so many cute and cheap finds here. Their 10,000 won backpacks and bags are the ""IN"" thing now in South Korea."
248,5.0,The best place in Korea to shop at really cheap prices for local souvenirs and local and international ethnic food.
249,5.0,"I like this place as this is full of life. People are going to places with traditional clothes and very charming. The areas feel very alive and many tourists enjoying all kind of shopping and other activities. Good place looking for art pieces, food and hang out. There are many attractive places to go and see and definitely good for shoping shopping and shopping. Recommended"
250,5.0,"I give 4 thumbs up for insadong. I love shopping here. Good place, good products. For tips, you can buy ""I love korea"" shirt for cheap n best quality (and full emboss) than other shopping place. Around $5~$7"
251,4.0,Visited here for another walk-shopping-people-watching. An art lover? This place is perfect. The street are full with people and the shops offer many crafts and souvenirs (pricey compared to Namdaemun Market). This area also has few art galleries but unfortunately during my visit few galleries were closed to prepared for next exhibitions. There's also hanbok rental in this area if you wanna experience the feel of wearing hanbok and walk on the busy street.
252,4.0,"You will feel so much youth vibes here! So many restaurants, cafe, shops and cosmetic shops, also fashion shops that will make you happy! But for some reason i think the souvenir shops here sell souvenirs with very high place compare to other market. I prefer buy souvenirs in other place like Dongdaemun or Myeongdong"
253,5.0,"Insa-dong is slightly different from other shopping streets (Ehwa/Myeongdong/Dongdaemun/Hongdae) as it sells more of handicrafts, art pieces etc. It's a lovely place to shop 1-2hours around at. It is also accessible by metro (alight at Anguk station, Exit 6)"
254,5.0,You should try to walk their both morning and night time (late one). Many street artist sing and dance at night. It will be a different experience.
255,5.0,"I really enjoyed shopping in Insadong. I've heard complaints about there being nothing but cheap, mass produced, souvenirs. There are a lot of those shops, but if you look closer, and pay a little more attention you can still find older, artisan shops and antique stores. We found some really wonderful gifts and souvenirs that are specific to Korea."
256,4.0,Lots of shops selling vintage or odd things. Some were selling traditional clothes and souvenirs.  It was nice to see a mix of old and new things. Lots of restaurants too.

258,5.0,Very much impressed by the traditional tea shops. Great looking and the teas and snacks are great as well.
259,5.0,"Insadong is a nice mix of old and new.  Especially on the weekend, you have traditional street artists and many stores selling Korean arts and crafts.  But there are also a fair number of modern restaurants and a few shopping galleries.  You can easily spend over an hour just walking around and taking pictures.  I'd say it's a ""must do"" for Seoul."
260,5.0,"Very cute area to visit, loads of little shops, coffee places, handicraft places, etc. Very korean style too. nice to wander around."
261,5.0,"Tons and tons and tons of shops selling Korean souvenirs, crafts and arts. Plenty of food and street stall options too. There are also a lot of art galleries to explore and appreciate works from talented Korean artists."
262,4.0,"We went in the morning so the place was fairly quiet, mostly locals and students. minimum tourist.  Enjoyed the nice morning walk, many souvenir shops around. Would recommend this place if you have spare time but don't come to the area specifically for it."
263,3.0,"Not many things to see here, unless you are preparing for buying lots of stuff here. I'm no a very fan of this place and I recommend to visit here if you happens to have more time in Seoul."
264,4.0,"Yes, it does contain some little alleyways, but I would not say that Insa-Dong is not quaint.  By and large, it is a busy shopping and restaurant area."
265,3.0,"Insadong is another shopping district with lots of small back alleys. Its more of a traditional market with lots of souvenir shops and some art places. The smaller alleys also got a lot of local restaurant. Dont plan to spend several hours here and do go before lunch time.I recommend combining this with Gyeongbokgung Palace, Bukchok Hanok Village, Changdeokgung Palass"
266,4.0,"We were here not knowing that this is the Hanbok Parade week!If you are Travelling by train station to insadong, you will surely see this artistic picture wall at the entrance/ exit to Insadong street. Many youngsters were wearing their traditional Hanbok and walking the street.  We have the chance to taste the famous ancient tea prepared by their Organiser. - the lotus tea. It was good ! I am a tea lover ! This is definitely a place for those whom love to buy some traditional Korean gifts for your friends and relatives back home. For me, I love to look  at the art gallery, the traditional tea houses and  eating areas, shops that sell Korean Vases and bronze based traditional utensils. A must  go place for first timer to Seoul."
267,4.0,"This is a fun area to poke around in the little shops and to get a bite to eat or drink.  Lots of little mom and pop places with friendly proprietors.  This isn't fancy, but that's what makes it laid back and enjoyable."
268,4.0,"If you want to see the more of Korea's culture from a more traditional point of view, then Insadong is the place to go. The main street that most people go to is full of shops where you can see different sides of Korea. You could be looking at a shop full of beautifully made Korean traditional wear and then be looking inside a more modern accessory shop right after. And if you're looking for souvenirs to get for your beloved peeps, then this is a good place to find something. With such an array of different items from different styles, there's bound to be something that catches your eye as the perfect gift.If you go around asking a bit, you can also find places that will rent our Hanboks (traditional Korean garments) for you to wear around and also to take pictures in. There are other places where you can do this, but this is also an option at Insadong.Now, the more fun and gimmicky things will require just a tad bit more looking. The main street in Insadong is pretty straight forward with what it's going to give you. However, once you slip into the smaller nooks and crannies, you'll find some interesting things that will definitely keep you entertained. Insadong is one of the most flexible places to visit in Korea. I say this because anyone can come and have a good time. It's a safe place for families to visit, has it's own interesting quirks that'll keep a group of friends laughing, offers exhibitions and shops that are perfect for solo travelers. Insadong is somewhere that should be visited at least once if there is time during your trip."
269,4.0,A good place to spend half a day and the best place for original and historical souvenirs from Korea. Also the nearby temples make this a place with visiting as it's near the main Palace. Also worth visiting are the traditional Korean house Street about fifteen minutes walk from the subway.
270,5.0,"In addition to the excellent shopping opportunities, there are a large number of incredible restaurants in the alleys.  We never would have found them on our own, but my d-I-l is Korean.  I couldn't tell you the names of the restaurants but they were great. Find a local and enjoy!"
271,2.0,"this place for handicraft and souvenirs shops.you can buy what you need from handicraft and souvenirs , but for me we got disappointed ,because we going to insadong at night 9 pm ,and we thought the market still work but we got only a few shops still open ,so don't visit this place at night .."
272,5.0,"Insadong is my favorite area of Seoul! There are a lot of tiny shops, Tea salons, and the required street vendors. Several coffee shops are along the Main Street as well.  However,  where the areas shines is the art exhibition spaces (Insa Art Center being one of the better ones).You can run into Buddhist monks from the nearby temple, artists, tourists from all over, and even people who will write your name in Chinese calligraphy on paper, fans, anything handy.Check out the stationery stores. Buy some postcards of k-pop stars. Try some bondaeggi. Watch the guys making the royal candy. It's a fun place to spend the day. Around the corner is a palace (see the changing of the guard) and a temple ( light some incense), and the business district."
273,3.0,"This street used to sell antiques in the olden days. That was gone so you would find more touristy stuff like post cards, hanbook, food. If you would like to buy real authentic korean antiques you can check 1 brand Tong In. good to visit."
274,2.0,It has been taken over by beauty shops and is nothing like it used to be. Skip this part of Seoul and spend money elsewhere.
275,3.0,"There are a lot of antique shops here. There are also several souvenirs shop but they are a bit pricey than Namdaemun. I went here just for sightseeing, the whole street is cool and calm as not much crowd is here compared to Namdaemun. We found shops selling bags for 10000 won. There are some decent bags available."
276,5.0,"If this is your first or even second time in Korea I highly recommend visiting Insadong. Is it touristy? Yes, but still a great district where you can buy traditional souvenirs, eat traditional food and try traditional tea. Also there are a lot of volunteers wearing all red. You can ask any of them for help. I also recommend exploring some of the more hidden restaurants and tea shops that are in alleys or basements. 5 stars. Go."
277,1.0,It's a tourist trap. Don't bother. The street is lined with antique shops but the prices are exorbitant and the products themselves are usually mixed in with cheap tourist memorabilia.
278,5.0,You can find any Korean traditional products and goods here. Great souvenir shop and lovely place to walk and shop.
279,5.0,"This walking street is chock full of everything from inexpensive souvenirs, to lovely clothes and jewelry.  Down the side alleys are many restaurant options."
280,4.0,"Insadong is famous street to both locals and tourists. We went to Insadong on the weekend evening, the street was full crowded, but I felt very excited and energy fully. There are a lot of shops, which sell vary of things as antique, art galleries and traditional stationery. If you want to buy some presents for friends and family, you should go to Insadong, many lovely souvenirs. In general, you can buy at a small lower than the price offer of sellers."
281,4.0,"A slightly different shopping experience as it has more artsy type of shops, rather than your usual Street shops selling t-shirts and shoes. Plenty of dessert and novelty shops which can be interesting."
282,4.0,"Insadong is a neat little place in Seoul that offers a variety of shopping. From trinkets to traditional Korean goods, there isn't much that can't be found here. I wouldn't say it's a particularly exciting place to spend time, but its streets are nice, and especially at night, there is a quaint charm to them.If you're looking to stock up on some souvenirs during a trip to Seoul, I would recommend coming to Insadong. You have to look past all of the mass-produced junk that a lot of peddlers are trying to sell, but in these streets, there are some real gems. Ssamji-gil has a few neat shops, for example, and the last time I was in Insadong, I bought some cheap paintings ($10 each) from a man doing art on the side of the street.Just keep your eyes (and your wallet) open, and you'll be able to find some interesting goods."
283,4.0,"All sorts of gifts,art lovers and couples would love it. Shopping street very busy at night with variety of gift + souveniers to be found. Lovers paradise with different eateries. Bargains can be found here eg handbags,sport bags,backpacking bags at very low prices. A must visit when in KoreA"
284,3.0,"Many shops sell souvenir items. However, the most interesting shop I've ever seen, was a Poo Museum in one of the plazas. It was basically an indoor play area for kids with a poo theme. Very bizarre but funny."
285,4.0,Good street for souvenirs and handicraft shopping. We were here in the afternoon after visiting Bukchon area. Its a lively place.
286,5.0,"A cute and quaint alley!! Loved the shopping, the outside mall area and the traditional tea houses. Definitely try the tea in Insadong. It was a fun day out. best of all, there is a pure vegetarian Korean restaurant for all the veg and vegan tourists. It was just so so so tasty!!! Highly recommend that."
287,5.0,"One of my favorite place to visit on all my trips to Seoul is Insadong, I love the atmosphere here and there's so many shops around for all your shopping needs, be it cosmetics, souvenirs, handicrafts, food, clothes, accessories, etc.. anything and everything.The streets are also not overly crowded and there's lots of traditional elements around, it's very artistic. Sometimes, you can also spot street performances.The food shops here are also great, lots of traditional and modern eating and drinking places, too many variety to pick from. It's really a great place to hang out for hours and never get bored."
288,5.0,The neighbourhood is full of quirks and surprises. Good very traditional as well as the hipster things to do!
289,4.0,"if you looking for Antique Street, please go to Insadong ( near Gyeongbokgung Palace) this please including traditional Korean restaurants, tea houses and galleries full of antique artifacts and local art.please set the full day for this place."
290,5.0,"This place was so cute and there was SO much to see! I really loved the unique boutiques. I found a new purse, gifts for friends back home, kids' toys, pet toys, and so much more! We also ate at a great Korean BBQ restaurant, visited the hysterical Poo Poo Land, and got our pictures taken in traditional hanboks (Korean dresses). There were a lot of people and the sheer number of stores can be overwhelming, but it is worth a visit."
291,4.0,"Walked from insadong to myeongdong after dinner. It's one looooong straight street down, . Preferred the quaint vibes of insadong, how the architecture is unique and how its is less crowded compared to myeong dong. Worth to visit!"
292,4.0,Great place to see old architecture and check out some quaint local stores. Can get a bit crowded towards the top of the hill (be prepared to walk).
293,3.0,"It was nice, one of my favourite restaurants is located here. But it's not really the ultimate place to go shopping. You'll find a lot of tourism stuff and souvenirs here, and there exists one bigger alley-ish place where the stuff are handmade but way overpriced."
294,5.0,The street has a lot of beautiful traditional shops and items. We just walk around and picked a restaurant for lunch. It turned out to be the best meal with affordable price for my whole trip at Seoul. We also went to tried Hanbok at culture centre with a small fee (sufficient for us to fool around with Hanbok 😆)
