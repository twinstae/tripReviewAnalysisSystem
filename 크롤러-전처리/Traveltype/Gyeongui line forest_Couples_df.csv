0,4.0,"Wonderfully relaxed way to spend an evening in manic Seoul. Right in the heart of Hongdae, with bars and restaurants lining either side or the park to enjoy with a picnic."
1,4.0,"We walked part of this this evening, from the Sinchon end into Hongdae and it was a delightful walk. The first part was clearly ex-railway and had been turned into an arty area with various sculpture. Regrettably part way along was blocked by buildings including a new one being built - hope they are building a continuation of the pathway beneath it.Beyond there was a cafe/eating/coffee/designer shops stretch that was really buzzing in the medium warm spring evening. Bet it gets really busy in summerAnd delightful walk"
2,5.0,This is a stand out location in the heart of Seoul suitable for different activities. Occasional shows and performances are also common. There is a library in the street and an old abadoned rail road.
