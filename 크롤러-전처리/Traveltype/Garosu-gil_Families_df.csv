0,5.0,This street is lined with fashion stores and cafes and youthful crowds. It's better than the many malls in Seoul as it offers good diversity and nothing beats outdoor shopping!
1,3.0,"Although there are lots of people here, but for some reason, I don’t feel any excitement here. Lots of cafeteria and some restaurants selling non Korean food. No street food. If you are looking for food, you might have better luck with the next parallel street to this one."
2,4.0,"It is a totally different experience beside visiting temples, palaces and ""hot"" food :) Many designer's shops and cute cafe to visit. Its a very kid friendly and most of them speak English very well...phewww"
3,5.0,"Unlike Myungdong (a lot of tourists, China town-like), this place is less crowded, with trendy/quality shops and cafe. Shops open at 10-10:30, early enough for most. Attached my lovely daughter in LINE store."
4,4.0,"This is one place that draws me more than Myeongdong for its more glitzy image and less congested street. Although the shops here are more upmarket, this street sprouts into narrower alleyways that lead you to myriads of cafes that offer a tantalising array of cakes and lattes. Four years ago i had stumbled upon this tiny but quaint cafe called the Banana cafe which serves cakes in a flowerpot and lattes topped with pink cotton candy. If you love skin care then you must visit the Skin Food Cafe after shopping for its products and the Dr Jart flagship store that flaunts its state-of-the-art deco to lure you to buy its array of products that promise to transform your face into a flawless complexion. That i can vouch for after I bought it’s line of Ceremide masks that uses nano technology!"
5,5.0,There are diverse and cool shops and restaurant.  Garosugil is most wealthy area in Seoul.  So there are many sexy and young girls here
6,5.0,"Filled with many independent shop, this place is a great exploration where one is able to see the talent and artistic korean in many aspect from fashion to jewellery. There are many high end shops here too"
7,4.0,"garosugil is a place to see and be seen. right smack in the heart of plastic surgery town, every corner you go, you will meet someone with bandages and theyre not afraid to show. this is the place to people watch and you can tell from the countless cafes with themes you will be spoilt for choice. a person can only stomach that much of a coffee in one day, but theyre so attractive i wanna hang out at more cafes. you can also grab your makeup supply and k fashion here. notable shops to stop by include, line, artbox, karl lagerfeld."
8,5.0,There is no shortage of café in Garosu-gil but Skin food café was lovely bright and delicious. don't miss out while you stroll down this lovely street.
9,5.0,"10mins walk from MRT station. I personally quite like the environment. Very nice street with mixture of boutiques, cafes and restaurants. I went there twice during the trip."
10,5.0,"Garosu-gil is located in the Gangnam area of Seoul. This is the more affluent part of the city, with BMW's and designer brands as commonplace as coffee shops. The best part about this place is that it's so scenic. Even if you have no major cash to spend on the big stores and brands, you can have a good time walking by the sidewalk and enjoying the trees swaying in the breeze. There are also lots of great places to eat here, which cater to all cuisines and tastes. (Try finding the Flying Pan and Saigon Market, which are really great places to try.) Don't be afraid to go into side alleys either, because we were able to try some delicious desserts at one of the cafes on their roof deck. Also checkout Artbox, which is a great place to buy affordable/quality souvenirs! I was annoyed I didn't find this sooner. Garosu-gil isn't the shopping mecca for millennials or frugal folks, but it's still worth visiting for the sights and sounds!"
11,2.0,"Quaint shopping area but aside from some nice restaurants, the clothing stores are all the same in every mall and shopping district you visit. There are a lot of the same Uniqlo, Zara, H&Ms etc everywhere and lack of local fashions or works. This area is for people with money, as is all the areas around Apjujeong district. Myeongdong has more variety but it's lower quality."
12,4.0,We got lost in Gangnam and ended up in this beautiful place. But it was too quiet and was not as fun as Myeongdong.
13,5.0,"Girls are Hot Hot Hot and good good good looking here - great eye candyMust visit and be sure to check out every shop, might find yourself the next k pop star.Oh shops are a good on a small streetDidn't end up linking the walk to apjugeong or cheongdam - it feels the same"
14,4.0,"you can see celebrities and models, expensive cars; you can also see people with bandages over their faces after plastic surgeries shopping around.  Shops are of mid range price tag.  in the side streets, there are many local food stalls where you can try Korean BBQ and Seafood restaurants with live fish"
15,5.0,A place to shop and eat.  A good place to hang around with its unique architecture.  Many young ones can be found in this place.  Love the shops and the food.
16,5.0,"Many shops and cafes along the road. The area is very clean and offer a nice view along the way. Many teenagers are here for shopping and hanging out. The shops are on the trendy and expensive side, but not luxury. But many cafes there are so nice. It's a good place for people who want to spend time shopping in a place not as crowded as Myeongdong or Hongdae."
17,3.0,"The main street is too big, 2 lanes for each direction so the trees along the street is not give you much impression. But when you go to the side street, only one lane for each direction, then you will get better impression. Nothing special in terms of stores - it's almost the same except there's a lot of Plastic Surgery Clinics here."
18,2.0,"Like someone else on here said, this area has completely lost its charm. When I visited a few years ago, it was full of independent cafes and very interesting shops to look at. The area also had a very cosy, hippie vibe. You could wander around the side alleys and there was always something interesting to see/buy. I was looking forward to doing that again this time around – but nope. Now all of that is gone and a lot of these unique shops have all been replaced by huge retail/international brands and a lot of cafes have moved to quieter, out-of-the-way places. I was looking around for this lovely café (Bloom and Goute) only to find that they have moved to a really odd area in some alley and had closed down!! Lots of shops have suffered the same fate. There’s also a distinct pretentious and snobby feel to the area, especially coupled with the somewhat stylish people who go there and have coffee and just sit around wanting to be seen. Interestingly, lots of girls in face masks – more than anywhere else I’ve visited in Seoul, possibly just out from one of the many plastic surgery clinics in the area. Almost everything here is overpriced, from the food to the coffee to the clothes and accessories. If you are looking to experience the Real Seoul, just skip this place and go somewhere else. I don’t think it offers much for the casual traveller looking to experience something about the local culture."
19,5.0,"This was a fun place to shop, there are leopard print shops, a huge MCM and a Whoo store. Also a few Western brands coming in like H&M. They have some nice multi- boutiques here as well selling various Korean brands"
20,5.0,Lovely place to walk and to have coffee in their quirky cafes and watch the world go by. Highly recommend the Korean restaurant at the end of the street called 'Insadong' (yeah a little strange since it is far away from actual insadong). Affordable and yummy bulgogi in a place where the coffees are expensive.
21,4.0,"On our way to gangnam, we stopped off at garosu-gil for some shopping and dessert.  This street targets your more affluent crowds.  A very pleasant experience with plenty of shops, cafes and dessert spots to spend the afternoon."
22,4.0,"We didn't plan to go to Garosugil but when I asked our tour guide for restaurant recommendations he told me to go to Garosugil because ambiance and surrounding is far different from the places we've been to.I later learned that it's a high end district mostly locals were there.. no tourists. Shops there are on the high end side and also cafes were beautifully designed. Cafes and restaurants there are just picture worthy, because of the style and design of the architecture. Truly the vibe is different.We ended up having grilled pork in one of the restaurants there, food was really great and a good run for money.If you have time you can go there and check it out but if love haggling and markets this is not the place to be."
23,5.0,"Located at Sinsa with a stretch of shops consisting of quaint cafes like CoffeeSmith, fashion wear and of course restaurants.Excellent shopping street for everyone, and also a few pop-up shops at the alleys. If you want Korean fashion, Garosu-Gil offers clothing for the fashionistas. The brands are generally Korean but with a few European shops along the way."
24,3.0,"I planned Garosu-gil into my itinerary but I felt that it was overrated upon reaching there at about 4pm. We went into a cafe for coffee and cakes. By the time we were done , the sky was already dark and the whole street looked beautiful just like those in european countries. would recommend that others visit it at night rather in the day time."
