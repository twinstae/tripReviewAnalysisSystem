0,5.0,The view puts this megacity into perspective.  The landscape from Namsan Park are phenomenal.  Lots of gorgeous photo opportunities.  Don’t forget to purchase a love lock and marker to display it with all the others. Definitely a must visit place in Seoul.
1,4.0,This is a very large park. On weekends can be very busy with lines of over 1 hour to get upstairs using the cable car.
2,2.0,"At the time of our visit it resembled a building site with much of the area fenced off for renovation. Billed as a Hanok  Village : village it's certainly not, but just a collection of 5  Hanok style houses assembled from elsewhere!  They are all rather similar and  quite dreary!"
3,5.0,"The park is connected to namsan tower. You can take the cable car to reach the park or you can take the long stairs way, about 1 km of stairs. The park is small but it has a nice view of seoul and you can also see the old seoul wall all along the park surroundings."
4,4.0,The park surrounds the Seoul Tower. We got a cable car up to the top but apparently the walk is nice and quite easy (to me it looked steep though). A lot of us were crammed into the cable car but it was a good experience. At the top there’s a few cafes and absolutely millions of locks of love - incredible.
5,5.0,"Hiked up from Itaewon, past the Grand Hyatt and into the park that covers the mountain. The views of the city are there, but much more to the point are the trails - paved, dirt or just tracks in the woods. Lots of flowers on the main paths. Places to stretch or rest or do other exercises. It is highly recommended and you feel much better for having walked there."
6,5.0,This park is large and will easily allow for half a day exploring (including up to Seoul Tower). Impressive views of the city. Very clean with well laid out trails. Recommended to visit on your first day!
7,4.0,To appreciate this place take the cable car and then pay the extra fee to go the top of the tower to really take in the views of Seoul.
8,5.0,"This is not actually part of our itenerary but i’m glad we did this. Fortunately since it’s just 5min walk from our hotel and we come early and we avoided the busy atmosphere.. It was peaceful and quiet until after 30 min when the buses from other tours arrived. You have to come early if you want to feel the place. Going back to the cable car, we wear the traditional korean costume for free in front of the mini stone tower monuments (between 11am to 12noon) and take photo with the guards. This is highly recommended for family tour."
9,3.0,"A great walk to take in the views back over Seoul.The walk up is a nice one of you're of good or even average fitness, if you're not up to that, or low on time, consider the cable car which was cheap at around $10 AUD (March 2019).Once you're at the top there's a few places to eat and drink and prices are pretty typical of any touristy place in Seoul. If you're a corny couple you can buy a padlock, write on it and lock your love - just like every other couple who visits. It's a nice thought, but do so knowing they get cut down from time to time and for maintenance."
10,5.0,"This is a great place to ride up to the tower to get a wonderful view of Seoul. It is amazing how big the metropolitan are is, pay the entry fee ride up and see for yourself, its WORTH IT!"
11,4.0,It was nice to see young Korean students there - they seemed to be on a field trip and it  was so cute to see them
12,5.0,"Fantastic views (just...wow) with a good bit to see and do. N Seoul Tower has a bit of history within Seoul and it’s with looking into. Popular with locals and foreigners, and is highly recognizable. Good food places available at the tower and nearby too. Spring or fall are when I’d recommend to visit (cherry blossoms or fall foliage)."
13,5.0,"Be there by 4:30PM, if you want to see the day view, catch the sunset, and see the night view of the Namsan Seoul Tower. Oh , there's a super long queue for the namsan cable car, but the queue goes fast. You won't mind the little wait. Just be there around 4pm - 4:30pm .  You will catch 3 types of scenic views :)"
14,5.0,"We decided to take the bus up to Namsan Park instead of riding the very, very crowded Gondola. The view is amazing; just make sure to go in early so you can take plenty of pictures - as it gets very crowded. Don’t miss out by not going to the bathroom all the way up the observatory... see my pictures and you’ll see why you need to go to their bathroom: aaaahh-mazing view!!!"
15,4.0,Tour of Seoul is never complete without visiting Namsan Park. A short cable car ride to the Tower Park.
16,5.0,I think this is one of those parks that would be pretty no matter what time of year you choose to visit. We came in November and admired the changing colour of leaves in hues of gold and red. Park itself is well maintained and very safe.  Do be prepared by coming with sensible shoes as there will be stairs to climb.
17,5.0,We spent the night at namsan park. Romantic place. but can be quite dim at night. Not much eateries.
18,5.0,Highly recommend walking to the top even during winter months. Although everything  was a bit brown in color the park was still nice and the view from top was great!
19,4.0,"We took the clear elevator going to the Namsan Cable Car Ticket booth. Then we ride the cable car so we can go up the Namsan Tower. Lots of Kdrama scenes were also shot around this area. So I took every chance I can get to take pictures and pose like the actors/actress. We ate before going up at a nearby café. There are lots of activities you can do in Namsan – Arcade, eat at a restaurant, photo booth, check the Hello Kitty Island Museum, shop, put a lock at the designated areas or just have coffee. At the observation deck of Namsan Tower, you’ll get to see the 360-degree view of Seoul. It was beautiful. There are souvenir items around the tower and some activities you can do. We got to spend a few minutes here and then just enjoyed the view from other areas."
20,4.0,"This is a nice ride up the mountain. Try to go for sunset, as the view is wonderful. Entrance is somewhat difficult to find due to the hillside. Best way to get there is to walk uphill from Shinsegae. There is an elevator that takes you to the the gondola landing. Lots of restaurants at the top of the mountain, but they will be busy."
21,4.0,Take the cable car to the top. It’s worth a visit. A little walking is needed so not suitable for wheelchair bound unless you are driving up. Great view of the city. Not too far away from the famous Myeongdong shopping area.
22,5.0,"There is a path that travels around and up the mountain that sits in the middle of Seoul. It really does sit in the geographical centre of Seoul, they even have a marker at the peak. The park is approximately 300 hectares. We were informed we called walk it, but most people take the cable car up and down. At the top is the N Seoul tower.We didn’t research the route as well as we could have, so we winged it a bit, yet still managed to get most of it in. We walked from our hotel to the base of the cable car. There is a large enclosed escalator / lift that takes you to the cablecar entrance. We followed a bunch of hikers up the road to the park entrance. Instead of taking the stairs that run adjacent to the cable car, we used the ring road initially and followed the maps we came across along the way. About 3/4 of the way around the ring road there was a short cut path to the tower, of course it was stairs, but not too many as it happens. Like everything else we have found in Seoul, the path is wide & extremely well maintained. There are heaps of pleasant stops with seats and picnic areas along the way. Oh and clean and warm facilities at regular intervals too. This made the walk a real pleasure. The view at the top is expansive, you can see 360 degrees. We opted out of going up the tower. We walked the stairs back down next to the cablecar and followed the ring road back around to exit down to Namsangol Hanok Village. In hindsight, I would have liked to have started here, then walked up and around Namson. Perhaps even maybe also explored the botanic gardens on the other side to have made an entire day of exploring the mountain."
23,5.0,"Fantastic views of the city with the added bonus of the tower, cable car and locks affixed to the railings which made a fun scene."
24,5.0,"There is a cable car,more fun however to hike up (30 - 45 min).see the locals in full mountaineer gear.On a clear day wonderful views."
25,5.0,"We got the cable car to the top of Namsan, went up the tower and then walked downhill through the park to get back to Myeongdong. Namsan Park is a beautiful green space in the heart of Seoul and is well worth a visit. We went in Autumn when the leaves were changing colour and it was really beautiful."
26,5.0,I recommend going here late in the afternoon --almost sundown-- so you can take good photos from up the tower and just enjoy the romantic view towards the evening. There are lots of dining places in case you want to have dinner.
27,5.0,"Very good facilities. The cable car is a short ride and only about $10 which is very reasonable.Then there is the tower. This is another ticket but worth it, and the view over seoul is great. There is a craze for putting up 'love' locks around all the fences similar to the bridge in Paris. There are tens of thousands of locks. There is also a daily cultural show to entertain tourists. Well worth the visit...."
28,4.0,"We could see the Seoul Tower from our hotel and it had been recommended as a place to visit. It was a short walk from our hotel to the elevator leading to the cable car station, and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get on the elevator. Once at the cable car station there was a long queue for tickets and no sign of a cable car, so seeing a path up to the Park just opposite the building, we decided to walk up, as many others did. It’s not a difficult walk if you are reasonably fit and is a mixture of steps and paved path (mostly steps), with plenty of places to rest and enjoy the views on the way up. It took just over half an hour to get to the park. Once there, there are plenty of places to have a drink or something to eat, and viewing terraces so you get a good 360 degree look at the city. We decided not to go up the Tower itself, although there was no queue to visit. To the rear of the Park there is a short slope down to several bus stops where we took a bus back down to the city."
29,5.0,What a fun morning.  The gondola ride up was short but fun.  The views from the top are outstanding!! Enjoy a beer on the 360 degree viewing platform.
30,4.0,"Caught the bus to Namsan Park, then walked up to the Tower.  The elevator ride to the top was like a Star Wars ride.  At the top, you get a beautiful view of the city.  There are shops, food places and restrooms."
31,4.0,"Took cable car up, which was a nice experience. Lots of places to eat in the main complex and convenience stores.We went up early evening so we could get daytime and night time views, both very pretty. We sat on a bench on one of the viewing platforms, with a couple of bottles of Soju and took in the views, as the city lit up. Very romantic."
32,4.0,Worth a trip to Namsan Park to get a great perspective of the city and enjoy the various attractions on various levels of this site.
33,3.0,"Namsan Park sits at the bottom of N Seoul Tower and offers quite a view of Seoul and its surrounding. There are several shows here during different timing of the day, where people light up the beacons on the hill to reenact a ritual from the past. Good to check the timings before you come.Aside from that nothing really special, except the place is just a park you pass by on the way to N Seoul Tower."
34,5.0,"nice view (we not had so good weather), cable car (I like it). you can also walk. Stations are easy to reach."
35,4.0,We took the free shuttle bus from Myeongdong. Then took the cable car up. Very romantic place with a nice view of Seoul.
36,5.0,A must visit to Seoul...try to be there late afternoon in order you can catch the night view also. Be prepared to spend a few hours there might consider supper also
37,5.0,"Namsan Park is home of the N.Seoul Tower but there is much more to discover especially on foot.  After a fifteen minute walk from our hotel near Jongno3-ga subway station we arrived at the foothill of the mountain and our first discovery of the morning was the memorial site of 'The Ground of Memory' dedicated to comfort women during WW2, a rather poignant way to start the hike.  From here it is all uphill via staircases, sealed and unsealed pathways and by the road, delightfully peaceful.The park was very pretty with the variety of changing colours of the leaves, different types of birdlife, running water features, undulating terrain and a visit to the Waryongmyo Shrine.  We passed many older Korean people out walking through the park, it was pleasing to see that they are not put off by walking hills.  After a very pleasant walk through the lower part of the park we arrived at the main staircase to climb up to the N Seoul Tower, most visitors will not take this path, rather choosing to take the cable car.  The hike up (1200m) is challenging but just take your time and the views and nature, it took us under thirty minutes with several photo stops.Nearer to the start of the climb up were drinking water fountains and toilet facilities, and roughly halfway up is a viewing platform called Jamdoobong Photo Island(North Point) with nice views over the park and Seoul.  If you are feeling up for a lovely holiday hike without having to travel far then Namsan Park is easily accessible by subway and on foot."
38,4.0,Perhaps the most accessible place in Seoul to get a view of the city. We visited 2 years ago and went back again this time with kdrama Korean Odyssey at the back of our mind lol....Both times we took the cable car up from Myeongdong and walked down. As we were heading down somewhere else this time though the maps in the park weren't very clear so we spent quite alot of time doing a roundabout walk to get to where we needed to be. The views at the base of Namsan tower are good so we have never bothered with the tower. There are many tourists so it's really busy. I was glad we managed to see the rebuilt Joseon era fire beacon signals and there were some people dressed in historic costumes as part of the experience. As it was our wedding anniversary we also did the cheesy love lock thing though we used our own lock as the locks sold in the machines and shops there are way overpriced - would advise couples to come armed with your own!! A must-visit when in Seoul and the park offers good walking routes if you know where you are going!!
39,5.0,"Nice place to see the scenery, good for pictures and plenty of restaurants. I would recommend, better to go during the evening or night for better city and sky views. Morning if you want to enjoy the whole city view."
40,5.0,From here you can see the city view which is amazing. The love bridge which was crowded & from the namsan tower you must go
41,4.0,"My hub and I was at the palace nearby when saw the sign that ahead is the Namsan Park. Initial plan was to take a bus up to Namsan Tower but since we were early, we decided to hike up. Honestly, not an easy hike as there were some steep slopes. We weren’t dressed in sports attire and felt that it would have been more comfortable to dress lighter since it was summer in June. But the hike up and view was nonetheless great. We spent about 45 mins to get up to Namsan Tower from the bottom. Good experience."
42,3.0,Namsan park is best visited in spring for the cherry blossom or autumn for the changing color of the leaves. From different sides you can walk up or down the hill but this might be bit hot in summer. Be prepared to meet lots of tourists but once up the hill you can enjoy the view.
43,5.0,"The place up there is really nice especially during sunset. However, the queue for the cable car takes more than an hour which is not really worth the time spent waiting. Taking a bus up there is cheaper and save time.There were live music during our weekend visit. Needless to say, the queue up to the tower was another hour long. Restaurants were full as well.So try not to go during weekends before sunset. Everywhere is crowded.While taking a bus down to Myeongdong area, passing through the cable car station after 9 pm, there were still queues of people heading up the hill. Unbelievable!"
44,4.0,"Great place, with great events. we even got to borrow hanboks for free to take some pictures. just be prepared on stairs"
45,5.0,Starting out from the botanical garden we hiked up along the city walls to the tower. While it's quite a bit of stairs and somewhat intensive it's a pleasant walk along the ancient remains of Seoul while surrounded by the buzzing metropole. At the top you're rewarded with nice views over the city.
46,5.0,"The highlight of my trip to Seoul was the climb up Mount Namsan and the rewarding views of the city.  We couldn't quite figure out how to access this park from public transport, but it turned out Chungmuro subway station (Orange line 3 ad Blue line 4) was perfect, just to the north of the Namsan Hanok village. After exploring the village a bit, head to the southernmost edge, near the time capsule, to a gate on the SW corner. Turn right toward the main road through Namsan, and there's a pedestrian bridge over it--depositing you on the northern circuit of the mountain park.  Follow the signs (turn left) to get to the entryway to the stairs to the summit.  Not an easy climb, but not grueling, and worth the views on the viewing platform and the summit."
47,4.0,Great views. Family friendly environment with plenty of photo opportunities. Skipped Seoul Tower because the view was good enough. Buy the round trip cable car ticket as it is a good distance to the top. Food available. Good place to hang out.
48,5.0,"The park is nice and quiet, and it is definitely a lovely place to go for a stroll. As the climb can be rather steep, I suggest taking the cable car up to the tower and walking the route down. Especially if you happen to be visiting on a very warm day like we did.I would suggest to get your hands on a map of the park before you visit - the area is big, and there are many routes down that connect to different parts of the city, and as such it can be rather easy to get lost. We also found a lot of signs were misleading when it came to distance (one sign would say 200 metres left, then 100, then suddenly 200 again!). A good map would have saved us, but instead we enjoyed the nature and some achy feet at the end of the day."
49,5.0,"My first few trips to Seoul I walked the distance. This time I took the cable car 😁. Regular cultural shows and displays and by the time you get to the to you willhave earnt your rest. Buy lunch, sit back and enjoy some amazing views. Can get really crowded on the weekends."
50,4.0,"Instead of cable car or bus, we walked to the top through Namsangol Hanok Village. The stroll and climbing of stairs (equivalent to 80 storeys) took about an hour to reach the Namsan Tower, where lots of tourists are transported by buses.Unfortunately the weather was hazy. The view would have been terrific otherwise."
51,5.0,"We went now in April and all trees are blossoming.Beautiful walk, very peaceful and absolutely amazing views of the city of Seoul.Definitely worth going up to the Seoul Tower either walking or by cable car."
52,4.0,"This is a very scenic park with a good view. There is a free lift to get up to the cable car station and from there you can either walk up the very steep mountain or catch a cable car. We took the cable car up - 6500 each one way and walked down, which was a nice way to do it.At the top it can get a little hazy/foggy, but can still get a great view of Seoul. There's a pagoda at the top, a few viewing platforms and of course Seoul Tower. We decided not to go up Seoul Tower as we thought the view from where we were was good enough.In Seoul plaza there was a demonstration of a 3D tv as well as a tourism area which had promotional tourism videos using virtual reality. That was pretty cool.A cute thing you can do with a loved one is to add a love padlock to the fence or to one of the love padlock trees. There were heaps of them and it was nice to view this monument to love. There was also a sign saying that a reality tv show had been filmed at this location."
53,4.0,"We spent a good few hours walking around the top of this hill, admiring the views from all angles.   I would advise arriving early when the crowds are minimal and avoid weekends if possible."
54,4.0,We went up the cable car and the tower as we are already there for our dinner at the MokMyeongSanBang which is at the foothills of Namsan. It is quite pricey but if you have plenty of time and enjoys tower view of whole of Seoul - this would be what you like. We were there just to kill sometime after dinner and since we are there - locked a 'love lock' just for the sake of it! lol
55,4.0,A good 6-8km loop with trails in between and with scenic views of the city. Be warned that it’s very hilly and there are stretches with steep slopes/many flights of steps. We did the equivalent of 72 flights in the 2.5 hour walk.Very invigorating and with a few quaint tea-houses along the way.
56,4.0,"Pleasant walk up to Namsan mountain. Great way to escape the city and enjoy an afternoon, time it right for a great sunset view over Seoul."
57,4.0,"The team ride for $8 saves from having to walk to the top (free).  At the top, there are nice views of the city.  The best view will cost another $10 to go up the tower. I would recommend for first timers."
58,5.0,We decided to walk up the mountain instead of taking the cable car. From the ticket office at the bottom you cross the street and find some stairs. It’s about a 30 min walk with lots of stairs but easily done. Lots of places to stop for a rest and take in the city views. From the top of the mountain there are lots of locks that you can buy and attach to the fences. It’s quite pretty! The views of the city are great as well. Worth a visit!
59,4.0,"We came here at around 4.30pm and it's was a good time and good weather for sunset. We took bus from Myeongdong and arrived at the bus stop at Namsan Park. There's a little slope to go up to the love locks corner. As we were a bit late, the crowds were already formed and all the spots for sunset sighting were taken. However, we still managed to see the sunset. I recommend to just stop here for the landscape sighting instead of buying the ticket to go up to N Seoul Tower, because this view is more beautiful than sighting from the tower itself."
60,5.0,"We came on Dec 31 when it had snowed the day before.  Since our hotel was in Myeongdong, the walk to the cable car was about 10 minutes.  The round trip price for the cable care is 8,500 won.  You can buy one way for 6,000 won.  While we were up there, we saw signs for the bus so apparently you can take a bus up although we enjoyed the few minutes up in the cable car.We walked around for about 30 minutes and enjoyed all the fresh snow on the ground.  A lot of people had the same idea.  It was crowded.After the cable car down, we saw the Namsan Ormi Elevator (FREE!) and it saved us some downhill walking."
61,3.0,It is a nice park and you can visit it after the North Seoul tower - this is what we did. Nice but nothing special.
62,4.0,"The main path to here is a short 10-15mins walk along the main road from Myeongdong.Once here, take the small Ormi Elevator up a very short slope up to the main building (queues can be very long- on the way down as well.Then buy a ticket for the cable car ( single big Ropecar), which takes you all the way up to Namsan Park( surprising it is quite high up the mountain). Its a normal weekday & the queues were very long!You can also drive or walk up to the main building, if you know the way.The view at the top is what one would expect from such a height - you can see the whole city 360°.Don't come in the night. Yes, the lights looks great at night from so high but frankly, night scenes all looked the same everywhere in the world, from similar attractions.We were there in early evening & could appreciate the actual city views in daylight. And we caught the sunset as well!If you are willing to fork out more fees, then go up the Namsan Tower. But I don't think it is worth it as that extra few feet up on the Tower is not going to make a major significant difference as this park is already so high up in the mountain.Avoid going on weekends or holidays. I can anticipate a long nightmare queues for the Ormi Elevator & the Cable car."
63,5.0,A wonderful place for a walk before heading up to Seoul Tower. The colours of the leaves make for great scenery and fantastic views
64,5.0,We spent a considerable amount of time walking and sitting in this garden. Lots of little areas to see and u can walk from garden to Seoul Tower. Lots of stairs so not ideal for strollers or those with an aversion to stairs.
65,5.0,I almost didn't go to this because I didn't think it would be too interesting but the view was simply amazing- so it absolutely exceeded my expectations. We went on a Friday morning around 10am and it was very quiet. No line for the cable car and no line for the tower.
66,5.0,"We used the metro subway and exited at Hoehyeon station. We walked up the hill and explored Namsan Park. It was a cool and relaxing walk and the views were great and the park was beginning to show the beautiful autumn colours. You could see the N Seoul Tower here and you can use the Namsan cable car if you prefer not to walk. However, we feel that walking is the best option as you get to stop and smell the flowers and admire the natural scenery."
67,4.0,There was a street performance which was great. You can get a bite to eat or grab a beer. You can take the gondola to myungdong from there or go up the nam san tower.
68,4.0,This tower has great view at night. There is an elevator to get the top of tower and elevator has amazing video animation inside. There is also sop which u can get candy :D
69,5.0,We took a sunset stroll after an early dinner in Myeong-dong to Cable Car stop. Queue was fast. Great to see the city before it gets dark and then see the city lit up. Walk around before sunset then have a coffee downstairs while it gets dark. Longer queue on way down or you could walk
70,5.0,"You can see all around Seoul there because it is one of the highest places in Seoul. You can get there by foot, bus, cable car. Easy to access and romantic easpecially at night. Please avoid going there from March to April. Because of air condition the chances for great view are very low."
71,4.0,"This is a nice park, never seems too busy.  I have been here twice now on different trips. The top of the park is where you can get the cable car, just work your way to the top (following the city wall) and then head towards the stairs, the famous stairs, the ""Samsooni Stairs"" made famous by a drama series in South Korea. They are trying to grown the grass so do no sit or stand on certain areas."
72,4.0,"It has everything,  hiking trails, ancient city walls, modern communication tower with a nice view, and yes, good restaurants. One may spend a whole say, or just 30 minute strol. So close to the downtown market, I plan to return and spend more time."
73,4.0,"A nice way to feel reconnected with nature without travelling outside of Seoul, Namsan Park has a mix between a park and urban feel. There are hundreds of colorful locks that have been fastened to the rails and posts that make for nice photos. The view of the city from the top is very good on a clear day."
74,4.0,A lot of joggers and bikers especially in the morning. You can see some old people walking from the park up to the tower. It's a long hike but there's a lot of resting stations.
75,3.0,Beautiful park with a cable car ride to the top.  Beautiful view and scenery.  View the Buddha.  Worth the trip.
76,5.0,"We hiked up this small mountain at entrance ""3"" right next to the cable car, it was well worth it. The hike itself is easy and fast if you are in decent shape. Along the way are great views of the city. The top near the tower is crowded, and full of expensive tourist things, but the real gem is walking around the park perimeter through the beautiful lush greenery, and there are so many cool workout parks! One of my favorite features of Seoul."
77,5.0,You may take the cable car to the tower but you can actually take a walk up. It's very refreshing and get a good sight of the city. There are also quite a number of walks in this park for those who love a natural walk/hike which will take you to other parts of the city. I tried  the one that skirt the old city wall and ends up at the gardens. Other experiences include going up the tower and at the square there are free Hanbok wearing experience and Beacon Lighting Ceremony by guards in traditional garb.
78,5.0,"After a few days in Seoul we felt like some walk and this park was more or less just behind our Hotel (Pacific). A short walk brought us to the cable car station. A one-way ticket cost just 6000 won (two-way 8000). The plan was to have a stroll around on top and walk back down to the city.There was quite a line. It was always moving, but still took a bit more than an hour to get us into the actual cable car. The ride up is a matter of only a few minutes....in a very very packed cable car.The top was a lot busier than expected. And had lots of shops and even more restaurants, really didn't see that coming.The first thing that catches you eye surely is the Seoul Tower. But the views of the city are already quite nice from the several platforms, so we didn't go up the tower (and avoided wasting more time standing in another line).Like I said, there are several platforms offering really nice city views. You can see quite far. Then there's the wall with the love locks. You can purchase some locks if you are interested in doing so. We didn't ... too old for this kinda thing :)There are at least two restaurants with great city views. One is a beer / fast food place, which looked fun, but all tables were taken. The other one (indoors, but with huge windows) still had tables....but menus that cost way too much (50'000 won and up). So we just enjoyed the views without some food or drinks.We were also lucky to catch a free show.... some warriors doing weapons-training. Quite impressive!After an hour or so we started walking down. It's a pretty easy walk and there are several roads and trails leading back to the city. We took the one that ends around the public library at the bottom with the city walls. An very lovely walk, pretty easy with a nice little park (Baekbeom Square Park) at the end. From there it's not far to the Namdaemun Market, where we did some (more) shopping. Walk along the city wall, a nice thing to do.All in all a good way to spend a few hours. If you have time on your hands, surely a thing that you shouldn't miss. Get some views, get some air...have a walk.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
79,4.0,"For a half day course for families and couples, Namsan Park can be a great opportunity to familiarize with the Seoul city. It can get crowdy, especially on the weekend and when the weather is nice and clear. There are several ways to the peak of Namsan Park. For tourists, the three easiest options are taking the cable car, walking up from the Millennium Hilton Hotel, and taking a bus. Least taxing is the cable car ride, which stops a staircase short of the peak. Bus ride can also be pleasant but not sure how often they go, so please check. For locals, there are many more shortcuts. At the top of the Namsan Park, what do you see and what do you do? Well, you can enjoy the 360 degree vista of the Seoul city.  On a clear day, you can really see very far but these days, due to yellow dust, haze and what not, the view is substantially compromised. There are cheap eatery places and cafes. At the peak is also the N Seoul Tower, which preferably should be enjoyed at night. Why not a romantic dinner high up in the Tower! Just beware that the food is not gourmet food but decent. Also for romantic couple, you can leave a lock with both of your initials in the special lock section often seen in Korean dramas.  After visiting the peak, you continue on by taking one direction when going down for easy stroll. To Itaewon, to Southgate (Namdaemun) and to Myungdong, to name a few."
80,4.0,travellers should use this namsan cable car located in the park to the N Seoul Tower. It takes around 3-5 minutes to the peak.
81,4.0,"Surprisingly, it wasn't too busy or touristy when I visited on a weekday. It has great city views and the famous love padlocks. It's a good place to take a few nice scenic snaps and that's about it. We took the cable car up there and explored the area in a hour or two.Make sure you visit on a nice sunny day."
82,2.0,"I can't say we did this place justice but my observations on the area would amount to the following:Padlocks attached to railings.More padlocks attached to railingsPadlocks attached to padlocks attached to railingsSmogPadlock hawkersPotentially great views (weather permitting)Nice change of pace from ""ground level"""
83,5.0,The view is super nice....The weather in october is super cold....But the view is spectacular....Its worth the trip...
84,4.0,Namsan (mountain) is recommended when whether is nice and sky is clear. Takes about less than 1hr from Shilla hotel to top of the mountain. Bus is also available.
85,4.0,"To find such a beautiful park in a city of 25.2 million, it breath taking. The park land as with so many things in Korea is well maintained, with ponds, flowers and wonderful paths."
86,3.0,"A nice gable car experience, but be prepared to wait especially, if you wish to go there in the early evening."
87,5.0,"Taking this path up to Seoul Tower rather than taking the cable car was a tiring but so worth it, the scenery is something to appreciate and we did so as the sun was about to set just in time for us to witness the turn from day to night at the peak. Take your time up, don't rush ;-)"
88,4.0,"Walked from myeongdong station to the escalator which traveled up to the cable station to reach the N Seoul Tower.You can bring or design your ""love lock"" if you do not intend to pay KRW8K for a lock.The weather can get a little chilly on top. There are many cafes/restaurants above for a romantic dinner."
89,4.0,"I visited the Namsan Park in spring 2017 and got the chance to see the beautiful cherry blossom trees. The place was quiet and peaceful. You can get scenic views of Seoul at the observation decks. I also came across the memorial for anticommunist fighters during my visit. The walk up Namsan hill can be tiring for people who are not used to climb uphill, but there is an option to ride the cable car. I didn't ride the cable car due to time constraint. I wish to return here again soon to spend more time at the park and maybe try the cable car."
90,4.0,"We reached Namsan Park via subway (Myeongdong station exit 3), a walk of about 10-12 minutes up the slope, and then via a 5-minute ride on the cable car. It was good enough for us to see the city from the top of Namsan Park, without having to pay additional to go up to the top of Seoul Tower. I'd recommend to visit Namsan Park in the evenings (after 5pm) so that you can capture nice views of the Seoul city night view from 7.30pm onwards."
91,4.0,"The park is big enough and very beautiful, there are the trees and cable car.A hundreds steps through the top of the park where the N Tower located."
92,4.0,Great views but I would recommend that if you are not in the greatest of shape to take the cable car up then take the stairs down. I did the opposite and I took the stairs up. I was so tired by the time I got to the top. Warning there are a LOT of stairs!!!
93,4.0,cable car ride round trip or single trip is also okhas lots of tourists in the afternoongreat place for a picnic up top
94,4.0,"See my review for N Seoul Tower. If you go there, you should absolutely not miss Namsan Park. And if you are in the area, don't miss Namsangol Hanok Village."
95,4.0,Great Night View to see Seoulbut make sure to check the weather(smog may block the view and windy days may be terrible for visiting)
96,4.0,"Good sides, the attraction on top of namsan hill is exceptional, the scenery is stunning and not too crowded during my winter visit. Also there is a mall which i found so convenient to shop. Downside, travelling to the top of the hill by cable car is a nightmare as the they will fit the car with as many passengers as it can fit which left us outstandingly uncomfortable. I would suggest to travel by taxi as the fare is not that expensive and cheaper than travelling by cable car."
97,4.0,"So we got a little lost after getting off the city bus. We wandered around for a bit and then had google, ""How to get to N. Seoul Tower?"" It then stated there was a tram, which we spotted soon after. We subsequently just in the general direction of where the tram was going and found the station!I really enough this, we didn't go up Tokyo Tower, Skytree, or Taipei 101. I figured, we need to at least go up this one... the shortest of them all. We wandered around, found some geocaches, bought the beer & popcorn package with out tickets. Took some touristy photos and enjoyed the hilarious windows in the bathrooms! All in all, a good time."
98,4.0,"We pretty much just used the cable car to get to the tower, which was really easy to use and the wait time wasn't long."
99,3.0,"Fairly average gardens, only worth a visit if you intend to go up to the North Seoul Tower, take the cable car from here."
100,5.0,"It is a autumn in Seoul. Go up with cable car. Enjoy a good seen, up to N Seoul tower. You can see a good seen of Seoul. Must visit"
101,5.0,"A relatively cruisy incline allows anyone to easily access and enjoy the park trails. For those more keen, there are more difficult trails branching off the main track. Along the way you'll see a variety of monuments and catch sights of the city. The first day we walked here was a typical autumnal day with brown, red and gold leaves in trees and scattered along the path. Gorgeous.Our second walk was after a moderate snowfall the night before, layering the hills and surrounds with beautiful white. Very relaxing and very worthwhile. If you're lucky, you may even spot a squirrel or two."
102,4.0,"This is a good place to go if you want to view Seoul in 360 degree on the observation deck of NSeoul Tower.  You can ride a cable car that is accessible from Myeongdong or if you want some walking adventure, you can start the hike from Hoehyeon Train Station.  There is a love lock fence at the top for couples or friends who would want to lock their relationship.   Aside from the observation tower, there are also small musuem for kids located at the base of the tower.  Restaurants are also available in the tower area."
103,5.0,"It is best to take the bus going up the tower, spend time in the summit, look at Seoul, the love lock walls take a drink leisurely enjoy the gardens and site. Then walk down the trails to truly enjoy the place. Buses can be taken as part of a tour, or the local buses at Itaewon foot of the hill. we took bus number 3 all the way up. Best to use walking shoes or boots, bring umbrellas in case the rains come."
104,4.0,We passed through this park on our way to the Korean War Memorial. It's a park on a hill with lots of stair to climb and that offers some beautiful views of the city from above. We walked it going towards the Seoul Tower as we climbed. There is a water fountain on the side and the memorial of an important Korean statesman on top. You'll also find a museum of ab important Korean martyr.
105,4.0,"Amazing how many locals go up here, not just tourists. You can walk or take the cable car. We did the cable. Lots of nice areas to walk up top of the mountain, and a variety of nice looking places to eat or grab a snack."
106,5.0,"You can take the old fashioned cable car to reach the park. You can view most the area of Seoul as the park is located at hilltop. If you have enough time, you may also stay in the park to view the sunset and night scene of Seoul."
107,4.0,We took the cable car to the top of mount Namsan expecting a bit of peace and quiet.  The top is not a haven of peace but packed with fast food places and entertainment such as Hello Kitty world.  Most railings have been occupied by lovers locks - padlocks declaring undying love.  The views are great on a clear day.
108,5.0,"Our intent was to go to the top of the N Seoul Tower.  We didn't realize  that at the base of the tower was this park.  The views are breathtaking, mixed with nature.  We opted to take the cable car to the top.  If you're in need of some exercise, you can walk up.  Based on my travel guide, it should take about an hour. When you reach the summit of the park, there are a number of different places to eat and even a drugstore.  Grab something to eat or drink and find a table overlooking the city.  There are also restrooms available. Lastly, we didn't bother spending the money to go to the top of the N Seoul Tower because the views from the park satisfied us."
109,4.0,"This is a fun place to visit, beginning with the cable car ride and the stunning views of the city. When you arrive at the park you have more beautiful views of Seoul and millions of locks left by visitors around the park. Worth a visit."
110,4.0,You cannot miss this park if you want to visit popular attractions such as N Seoul Tower or some pavillons.
111,4.0,Nice place for couple there is so many teenager here. And u can go here with cable car. But it take a long time for queque
112,5.0,This is the best way to enjoy your journey to namsan tower. Don't bother with crowding yourself with tourists in the cable car. Take your time to walk up. It may be hard but so worth the trip. The view on the way up is amazing too!
113,5.0,"From the bottom of the park, you ca walk to the top of the Namsan Park in 30 minutes. If you can, I recommend one to walk to the top of the mountain. You can also go to the top of the mountain using a cable car."
114,4.0,"I’m sure glad we visited in February because we decided to walk from Namsan Park to the N Tower. It was all uphill of course and was quite tiring. Had it been sunny and hot and worse, humid, it would have been dreadful. Since it was pretty cool that day, it was perfect but still tiring. Yet, there is nothing to stop you from taking breaks and especially photos because they are quite picturesque. The shins were hurting too on the way down but you live once so just do it. The park itself is relaxing and many locals gather to just hang out and enjoy the beautiful scenery. I did appreciate the weather and the park at Namsan."
115,4.0,A very nice route for about 2 hours walking.A lot of nature and even small shrines give the place a traditional touch.Very nice
116,5.0,we walk from our hotel - grand hotel myeongdong to the cable car station. It takes around 15 min...the park's view was amazing...
117,5.0,"We intended to take the cable car to the top of Namsan but inadvertently walked half way up the hill before realising we'd well and truly missed the cable car station. Nevertheless, the climb itself is reasonably easy for someone who is in reasonably shape and although tiring the views at the top or worth it. At the top there's a cafe and information on the history of the beacon that was at the top of the hill in the past. We were lucky to catch part of a performance of traditional Korean martial arts which was excellent and a bonus. I would definitely recommend paying to go up the tower once at the top of Namsan as the views are amazing - we sat near the edge with a drink bought as part of a combined ticket at the bottom - spent half hour or so up there, before coming back down then taking the cable car to the bottom. A must if you have a couple of days in Seoul."
118,5.0,"A wonderful place in any season. The walkways, whilst making a stroll a tather foralised affair, guide you through flower beds, wooded areas and ponds. There are a few natural spring areas and play / exercise zones. There are some rather steep hills to tackle but the views are worth the climb. The public toilets are good and there are plenty of picnic areas. There is nowhere to buy food unless you go up to the tower. There is no smoking anywhere in the park. A lovely day out and a great place to run."
119,5.0,Would recommend taking cable cart to the top of the tower then walking down Nasam. It is a great day out away from the busy Seoul.
120,5.0,"Walk there from sungnyemun gate inside the wall up hill towards Seoul tower.  It's a really nice park with paths and various statues,  there are a couple of places to get fountain drinking water and use the bathroom.  Not very busy at all,  people probably can't be bothered to walk up hill. I would recommend it."
121,5.0,"If you take a taxi to Seoul tower, make sure they drop you off at Namsan Park. I learned the hard way, walked to top of Seoul Tower, luck to take tram down"
122,4.0,Going to Seoul is not just about eating and shopping. Traveling to Namsan Park gave me a great memory. There are many spots for photos. Worth to go.
123,4.0,"Took one-way cable car up and trekked down during sunset. The view was amazing. Of course, the 18 degree celsius weather helped. It was cooling and so therapeutic to trek down all the way to Myeongdong Shopping Street. Took us about 30 to 45 mins!"
124,4.0,"Had not planned to come to Seoul to see cherry blossom on purpose but was delighted to catch the last few days cherry blossoms in full bloom. Namsan Park is one place to see the splendor of the cherry blossoms. We took a coach up and not trek, but found the view along the way so mesmerizing. When we reached the park, when some of the cherry blossoms shed their petals in the wind, it was one of the most romantic scenes that I have ever found myself in. It was as though it is snowing minus the chill.I think if I have the chance the next time I am there, I will probably attempt to walk up the hill."
125,5.0,"Heard so much about this tourist spot and realising that it would be a struggle to climb up on foot we decided to take the cable car instead. It's all worth the pay for the ride though it's just a few minutes but you get the chance to see the entire city and the thrill of it. Upon reaching the top you'll be met with a small snack stall that sells twisted potato in bamboo stick cost W3,000. From there you can walk around the mountain park in peace. Surrounded with lush greenery in different varieties, color and texture. Unfortunately, we missed the cherry blossoms for its late April now but they laid different colours of tulips along the walk for a photo enthusiast! The famous Seoul Tower is also a must but you have to be patient if you want to experience the 360 view of the city at a reasonable fee. Overall, we enjoyed our time here. To take the cable car, you have get off at Hoehyeon subway station then walk to intersection of sogong-ro and turn right. From there you'll see the cable car station."
126,5.0,"We visited Namsan Park when going to N. Seoul Tower.The cable car ride was definitely worth doing, saving our legs for walking elsewhere in the city....."
127,5.0,A great park to go jogging in especially early in the morning. We stayed at the Hyatt so it is really in front of the door. Also nice for leisure strolls anytime of the year.
128,5.0,"We took a taxi for W3200 from Westin Chosan to the park a short drive away.Paid W8300 for two way cable car to the top where the Seoul Tower is.Breath taking view of the city.Couple of eating joints providing western,Korean and Chinese cuisine."
129,4.0,"we took the cable car up, wanted to see sunset from there but due to the cold weather we didn't waited for sunset, anyway is a must-go place when visiting Seoul"
130,4.0,"There are some shops for ice cream and such when you get to the tower, and there's also a gift shop. When you get to the tower, I recommend to get a lock and a key to chain the lock on the fence of the tower. Many people do this, and hopefully there's space for the lock. I recommend to not go at Christmas because it's extremely crowded, and will take many hours to wait in line to get to the top of the tower. The view of the city reminded me of how amazing Korea is, and how it has grown so much economically over the years. Korea used to be one of the poorest countries in the world not too long ago. But now, it has grown so very much!"
131,4.0,Beautiful 360 degree city views!! This is a beauty of nature. You can see a wonderful view of the city from the Seoul tower and
132,5.0,"We walked/hiked from Namsangol Hanok Village to the Namsan Park/Seoul Tower. It took us around 1 hour and a half to get there but the journey was all worth it. The effort of walking/hiking made the lovelocks more meaningful. Namsan park have cafés, restaurants and souvenirs shops which made our afternoon walk cozier. Drinking coffees at the sight of Seoul’s cityscape while writing down on our lovelocks is really a memorable afternoon."
133,5.0,Awesome trails for running.  Beautiful park and worth a visit if you enjoy the outdoors.  Lots of greenspace in Seoul.
134,5.0,Namsan Park and Ntower visit is a perfect combination. before you can reach the tower you will definitely see the park first. try riding the cable car for the experience and then stroll around the park with all the love locks attached to the railing of the park is really unbelievable. you cant count how many are there. excellent place for everyone. worth visiting when you are in seoul.
135,4.0,Good large city park with lots of little walks. Although there is a cable car to the top it often has long queues and the walk is nice. It took us less than 25 minutes to the top but maybe allow longer to look around and appreciate the view. From the top the views are very nice even if you don't go up the tower. We went at sun set and it was very busy. There are plenty of toilets in the park and quite a few shops at the top.
136,3.0,"It's a bit hard to find the entrance to the cablecar, but just ask a local or follow the other people walking that way.  This is a nice ride to get up to Namsan Park and Seoul Tower.  Don't forget your camera!  From the top, you can catch a free shuttle back to the Myeongdong area."
137,4.0,"If you are able to walk, do not get a bus up Namsam tower or evwn the cable car. Walk the winding path all the way to the top and you will see spectacular 360° views of a massive city built in the indents of a vast mountainous, ocean kissed land. You will see unique wildlife and unique people. You you will see lush landscape and sprawling chronicles of a truelly magical city. Like most things in Korea, it's free!! Must see."
138,5.0,"Namsan Park is where N Seoul Tower is located. Autumn here would be awesome as you see the varying leave colors. Nice place to hang out with your loved ones, family and friends"
139,5.0,"Take a walk thru this gem- Namsang park, and you will fall in love with its beautiful trails, turns, and all over wonders of nature."
140,4.0,"Since having slightly handicapped travellers in my group, instead of walking up the hill to the park, we chose to take the bus ride.  On the sunny day, we found many people there.  From the bus station, we can have a good view of the city.  Further up will be the N Seoul Tower.  Definitely worth to visit.  You can take the peak tram ride if you want."
141,4.0,"from myongdong station, you can reach this place on walk about 15min, then you'll find cable car station. paid 6500won for single trip or 8500 roundtrip. it's a beautiful clean park. you can also see city view from this park..walk a minute and then you'll get to seoul tower."
142,5.0,"beautiful view of night scenery for lovely couples, i will come again on winter season!! c.c: Geum JanDi"
143,5.0,"The park has a northern circuit and a southern circuit. I did the northern circuit. The park was popular with families, couples and tourists. Fall foliage was beautiful. The outdoor gym was an interesting idea. I went to the waryongmyo( a shrine dedicated to Zhuge Liang). A beautiful place up a flight of steep stairs. The park is huge. I did not feel it was crowded with the weekend visitors. Pack a lunch and enjoy it at one of the park benches. A great break from the hustle and bustle from metro Seoul."
144,5.0,"You can take a bus tour to the top or a taxi to this gondola. You cannot get to the North Tower any other way. This is a fun ride, it's very full. If you are afraid of heights or claustrophobic, take the bus tour up to the Tower."
145,3.0,"Don't take the cable car, it's not enjoyable. It's packed like sardines. Did not really enjoy the ride up the hill.But it's the fastest way to get up"
146,3.0,"That was my first time went to Korea, and I went to Namsan park and other sightseeing place.! The place is little bit dirty, garbage is everywhere. It was cold there, so I think people are lazy to throw the garbage in the place. But I really enjoy the food all the time.!"
147,5.0,"So upfront, there is a bit of a wait when you go here but it is one of the coolest things we saw when we were in Korea.  The ride up is not very exciting but the views from the top are amazing.  I mean it.  My wife and I have seen many wonderful views in our life but this place will always be up there in our hearts."
148,3.0,"Waited 45 minutes to take the cable car to the park.  By the time we got there, it was nearly dark and we stayed less than an hour.  The best thing about it is the fine view of Seoul from your perch in the hills.  But if you feel, as I do, that I came to BE in Seoul, not to see it from above...this is an experience to be added only if you have time."
149,5.0,"The Namsan Park sits just under the North Korea Tower, you can ride the cable car to the top, you can also walk if you prefer walking but I will advise that you take the cable car, it is cheap and gives you an exciting view. Visit at night to see the lights of Seoul"
150,4.0,I went during winter and the weather and view was awesome... took the cable car and the scenery was priceless... got to hang the love lock... Will definitely be back on December 2016... with my love of my life.. MY huband
151,4.0,"Visit it during evening time to catch the beautiful sunset from the top (around 5pm-6pm), and lock your love at one of the fences :) It might be quite cold in October, so it'll be better to be prepared. You can also walk up to the tower, and the many options are available on their website. You might want to take a cable car, like we did, but you will have to walk up from Myeongdong station (there are a few other options), and be prepared that the walk is quite steep. For the tickets to the cable car, if you are going in pairs, it might be worth getting the package with the pork cutlet. Their pork cutlet is quite tasty! We paid to go up the tower, and it was a beautiful sight. We got a package with a huge popcorn box and two drinks, which in my opinion, is super worth. However, the popcorn was too much for us as we did not really like popcorn. It was slightly rainy, so we didn't quite get a good view, but after the rain, it was a lot better. Something different from the usual hustle and bustle in Seoul."
152,5.0,"For an awesome view of the contrasting autumn foliage colours against the concrete jungle of Seoul City, go up Namsan Hill!"
153,5.0,"From Itaewon area, take Bus 3. We took the bus from stop opposite Hamilton Hotel and it took us to the top of Namsan (last stop) from where its a 75 m steep walk to the base of Namsan Tower. Get a good view of Seoul, sit on the steps of the base, relax a bit, eat an ice cream, shop souvenirs before you continue on."
154,4.0,"it is a short cable car ride to the park itself. If it is not within your budget, then you can walk up too. (I have to say, we climbed Baegundae peak and at 836m, it is the tallest mountain in Seoul. The views and the hike was more rewarding than this). Once you reach the top you are treated to some amazing views  of Seoul. But be prepared to jostle with the crowds, including yourself. It is quite commercial at the top. Shops, restaurants, gift shop, etc. Lots of people bring locks that they lock to the fence - lovebirds. You are not supposed to throw the key. It is not a must to visit, but if you are in seoul for more than a week and time to spare, it can be good"
155,3.0,"Paid for a round trip ticket on the cable cars. The line was very long. We waited over an hour to get on the ""up"" car. My tip is to either go earlier in the day (everyone wants to see a sunset or lighted cityscape), or buy a one way ticket and walk down (which we did since the ""down"" cars would have been an hour or two wait).  The views are amazing, it is worth going up there, just be aware of what you are in for."
156,4.0,"The park is pretty good for hiking. We started in the park when we went to the tower. I was sick at the time, so the hike was a little difficult. However, getting to the top makes it totally worth it. A beautiful little escape from the city."
157,5.0,Good view from the tower but steep walking from the bus or cable car to bottom of tower.  Easy to reach by public transport.
158,4.0,"Visted on a Sunday so it was crowded. Traffic was pretty bad but actually cool once we reached the spot. Many photo opportunities, few gift stores, and food available. Took a taxi there since I didn't know how far it was but easy walk back to myeongdong."
159,4.0,Didn't do the park as such but took the cable car to the N-tower. Extra charge to go up the tower but the views make it well worth while.
160,5.0,"Namsan Park is located very near to the City centre, it is very convenience to reach it either by bus or by tram.During the daytime, your can find different views in different seasons. Personally I love to travel in Spring (Mid March-Mid Apr) or Autumn (Mid Sept-Mid Oct). The nightview is also wondering which you can watch the view changes from sunset to night lights."
161,4.0,"Take exit 3 from Myeondong station and turn left where you will see a path directly behind the exit follow it up to the Pacific hotel (not far) on the fork in the road, take the left path and head up.  Turn right at Taegye-ro 20-na-gil and climb up the steep road.  When you get to the main road do not take the steps as the guide recommends (I did and couldn't find the cable car) but turn right and look up you will see the cable wires carry on up the road and you will see the cable car station.  It costs about 9000won to take a return trip on the car.Once there are enough people to fill the car (about 40) it will leave, taking a slow trip up the hill of ten minutes.When you disembark continue up the wooden steps to the viewing decking.  Here you will find plenty of viewing choices and if you are lucky you will see old fashion soldiers parading around for you to take photos off.  If you want to go up the tower it costs another 9000won per person.  If you come this far I would recommend it."
162,5.0,"The Cable car is quite full most of the time , the time we went up already have alot of people up there , nice view and also N seoul tower is up there. Good for couples"
163,4.0,"Namsan Park provides a beautiful view of most of Seoul. The cable car ride is smooth and comfortable. The prices are a bit high, not only for the cable car but for the refreshments at the top of the hill. Also, depending on when you go, expect to wait about an hour on line.Try to pick a clear day for the best view. Definitely worth checking out if you are visiting the city."
164,5.0,"that just like the city lung in Seoul, beautiful, quiet and nice park, with many Korean visitors, but inadeuqate public toilet"
165,3.0,"There's better parks in Seoul...If you're not planning on going to N Seoul Tower than I'm not sure why you'd go to Namsan Park. Some might make the argument that there are trails and roads for hiking and biking in Namsan Park but there are TONS of better places to hike and bike in Seoul. It was a great place for the blooming cherry blossoms in Spring but like I said with the hiking and biking, there's better out there.Only purpose of going there for us was to go to N Seoul Tower and I don't plan on going back again. The cost of going up to the observation deck at N Seoul Tower was too much in my opinion and there was SOOO many people (large tour groups and buses) at the top of Namsan Park it was hard to enjoy it."
166,4.0,"must visit!!We going to Namsan Park with cable car at day one but to crowd and skip for that, so we going there at the next day with bus. the bus so crowded too but lucky we are still get the bus. the garden was great, I loves being at the high place there we can see around the city. not as good as at Hongkong but Namsan hill have different to enjoy."
167,4.0,"To keep it short. I went here with my Korean girlfriend, it's a lovely place. We also brought our locks and hang them up. And if we're still together after a decade or so, we would love to go back and pick them up again, haha.The view is great. You can see all over the city. It's slightly overpriced imo, but ah well, it's good to go."
168,4.0,"Restaurant  on the top of park is worth visiting, overall experinec to walk with locals and foreigners is pleasant"
169,5.0,Namsan it Seoul's gift to the city.  It is a beautiful natural green space in the center of the city.  It is great for walking.  Different paths are available to suit the expert to the novice walker.
170,4.0,"Namsan park and tower is definitely worth a visit. There is no better place to get a nice view of the city. It's also close to Myeongdong so you have plenty of things to do afterwards.Go there early to avoid the crowd. I only waited about 15 minutes to get onto the tram. Bring your own lock or buy one there, it's not that expensive. But keep in mind that there are multiple locations to place your lock. The first one you pass is not the only location. There is another one higher up the stairs to the observatory. So don't rush to place your lock or bring extra if you want to place it on both locations.The Namsan tower also has a deal that gives you a combo 2 ticket, 2 drinks, and popcorn. Just a warning that the popcorn is huge. I was expecting a little cheap bag but they really go all out. The view above is ok but nothing you can't see for free down at the observatory."
171,3.0,"If you have a day free,go walk in Namsan Park, it is beautiful. Views are terrific and depending on whst time of year you are there the flowers and trees are beautiful. Plenty of places to stop and rest and take in the sights. Walked the park many times, well worth it."
172,5.0,"Take the bus up & the cable car down.  Great views.  A few too many teenagers attaching love locks to everything.  The short walk uphill from the bus stop is quite a trek and a stretch on the calf muscles!  Rather than bother with the observatory package which didn't strike us as great value (maybe I'm wrong), we just had a drink inside the window of the Italian restaurant on the 2nd floor and admired the view in a nice quiet place."
173,5.0,We took a cable car upto the Namsan Tower and saw the factastic night view of Seoul. One of the romantic places in seoul. Many couples around us and whispering their love.
174,5.0,"Standing high over Seoul Korea is a hill with a unique tower.  Namsan Park, or the Seoul Tower as it is mostly called is a must visit. There is a cable car you can ride or you can just walk to the top.  At the park are many little shops and restaurants.  There is a Teddy Bear Museum and lots to see. At certain times (check before going if interested) there are musical performances outside the tower.  When you have finished exploring all there is see and do outside, you enter an elevator and go to the top of the tower.  There is a viewing platform that circle the inside of the tower.  Signs let you know that you are facing places such as San Francisco.... You can have your picture taken. ( surprisingly not expensive) and buy more souvenirs.  Before you leave the grounds be sure to purchase a lock of love to place outside with the love of your life.  Take the key with you when you go and at some romantic place, say a visit to Hawaii, throw the key in the water as you pledge each other your love.... I know, corny, but that what we did!!  Namsan Park is a fun visit!"
175,4.0,"Very nice for first timers. Went to the Namsan Park (and N Tower) with my girlfriend late at night, which was good because most of the tourists were gone by the time we arrived at the peak by the cable car. The place offered a breathtaking view of Seoul and it is quite romantic. Being a park, the place also has lots of free green areas for people to hang around and take pictures. And the shops up near the tower are adequate without feeling too commercial and tourist-y."
176,5.0,Take the city bus to the top. Skip the over priced tower. We walked down from the top to the lower park which is very beautiful. Once you get away from the very touristy area surrounding the tower which is packed with loud Chinese tourists its very quite.
177,4.0,Lovely large park and garden area with a number of transplanted ancient Hanok houses complete with period furniture. Also a few live artisans at work. Worth spending 2 - 3 hours wandering around.
178,4.0,A fantastic park in the middle to a thriving Metropolis. Make sure that you travel along some of the walking tracks along the City wall.
179,3.0,The park itself is nice but very crowded. The tower is a rip-off. You have to pay twice (cable car and tower elevator) and this isn't mentioned when you want to take the cable car. Hike up the hill then enjoy the view. Avoid if you don't like crowds.
180,4.0,"Seeking peace and quiet yet close to the city centre, this provided a beautiful sensory experience. A few hills to climb so it may be difficult for wheelchairs and prams but otherwise very worthwhile."
181,4.0,"The view from the cable car towards illuminated Seoul is just perfect! But be prepared for a long wait to take the cable car down, better walk."
182,5.0,"This park is beautiful, would definitely recommend walking through it for a lovely stroll. It took us about 1 hour, I went with my husband. It isn't a hike it has some hilly bits although a lot of it has a wooden stairway. If you like nature, parks or enjoy a good walk I would definitely suggest going through this. Don't think of this as a method to get to the Seoul Tower, I would say that the walk through Namsan Park is the main attraction rather than the Tower... Our suggestion on the route we took: we started from Hangangjin station and took the exit and once out walked in the direction of line 6 (directly South) and you will see the wooden stairway on your right. Take this route and keep following that to get to the top. At points the stairway will stop and there will be hilly bits or going through the park, here just look for signposts pointing towards Seoul Tower. Sometimes we took a detour as we got involved in taking photos and discovering new paths that went down to look upon a forest view, but that was fun! The Tower is just too hyped not worth it, while the walk through to get there is totally worth it.There are beautiful trees, can take beautiful photos if you're into that, there are these little stop-overs which I believe are to view the sunset. We went during the day and it was quite serene and I believe it would be good during the evening too. It wasn't very crowded as most people tend to take the bus or cable car to the Tower (not worth it). We carried lots of water and some snacks and wore flat shoes of course! This meant that we could have little treats and enjoy the moment when we got tired. At the top there is the photo island where you can see the entire city (this is just before the Seoul Tower) and it's a great view! The best part was all of this was free, the Seoul Tower was a bit disappointing (I have written a separate review for that)... But we were still happy as we did the walk and enjoyed coming up and going back down from the Tower. The cable car option is too expensive and you would still need to walk, except you miss walking through the beautiful bits that way and it seemed crowded. Hope you enjoy the park too, we loved it."
183,3.0,"To walk up would be very tiring for my age group. Went in the day time, so the view is not impressive. It might be in the night. Aside from all those 'love locks,' there is really not much to see or do. There are restaurants, cafe', and sweet shops."
184,4.0,"We took the elevator to the cable car station and then took the cable car up to Namsan. The hill full of cherry blossom, very nice scene when cable car going up. We went there around 4-5pm, less crowded and short queue. Nice sunset view even though the day i went is a little bit of foggy. Nice view of wall of love locks at the side. Good place for wedding photoshoots."
185,5.0,You can try the restaurant at the end of the cable car ride. There is one pasta/pizza restaurant which offer a stunning view of the city. Food is also pretty good. If you come by during the cherry blossom period you will be able to see lots of cherry blossom and other type of flowers along our way. You can also take a taxi up if you do not use the cable car.
186,5.0,Abosultely great walk with the Cherry Blossoms in bloom. Try the steps up the old wall to reach Seoul Tower
187,4.0,We walked from Bukchon Village to the cable car (uphill so be warned) and took the cable car to the top.  Definitely nice views to take in of Seoul.  Make sure you stop by the Locks of Love - quite a novelty and makes for great pictures.  The place was plenty crowded in the afternoon but still enjoyable.
188,3.0,"If you are a person who does regular exercise, try walk up the hill.  The cable car had a long queue and when we finally got in, it was cramped and felt like it's overweight.  The ride only took less than 5 minutes but the wait was like an hour.  It only took us 1/2 hour to walk down, so double the time it's 1 hour to walk up I assume, where you can actually sight see and not be seeing people's noses during the ride."
189,4.0,"Avoid the main road and go uphill from behind. You'll be surprised how tranquil it can be. The walk is also very easy, and good for conversations with your peer(s)."
190,4.0,"It was Spring when I visited this time around, and the strong wind turns your hand super icy! But I must say the view is worth it and the popular lock bridge filled with thousands if not millions of colorful locks. This is where couples write down their vows, express their love to one another and interlock their locks at the base of the tower, before throwing the keys away into this huge box. In other words, locking their love for eternity! Yeah, might sound cheesy to some but I'm sure most ladies will find that very romantic. I even had a lock there with my best friend! And of course another previous one with my husband."
191,4.0,"there are two way to get there.the one is a cable car the other one is a tracking.I prefer second way but it's little bit hard to find the way. So if you are normal traveller, using the cable car to go to up is better. Here is really good for whole view and night view of Seoul.The one thing for note is you will meet huge group of Chinese there"
192,5.0,"This is a must see. I too was a bit skeptical about night views of the city for an attraction, but this is so much more. Don't just jump on the cable car. Walk the park below, lots of steps if you choose but worthwhile. The walk around the park was beautiful, locals doing their walks, lanterns all identically styled hang to lead the way. Little resting places. Relaxing, beautiful. Peaceful. Then we took the Cable car. The cable car is ok, but I think the views at the bottom of the tower are better. Pretty low to the ground if you're scared of heights. Love locks. This is the birthplace. I didn't expect to be drawn in but it's amazing. Bring a permanent pen, buy a lock for 5000-10,000 do it. Super Korean style romance. NOT THE PLACE FOR BROKEN HEARTS. So many couples young old in the whole Korean style perfect smiles and love seats kind of way. Like a movie. Normally, this would Be a bit too silly for me but this is Korean culture expect to see couple with matching shoes, jeans bags. It's a bit fascinating.  Excellent views that show how big Seoul is. I was really impressed. I didn't bother with n tower, I'm sure the view is even better but it's pretty expensive and the platform is full of people and fun, as well as great views  Go in the afternoon before sunset, leave after sunset. Restaurants here if you want to have dinner. Lots of couples as well as groups of friends.  Allow more time than you'd expct, it draws you in. Rewarding."
193,5.0,Fantastic view of the city with a beautiful walk through the gardens.  The paths are quite steep in places so be prepared.
194,5.0,Korea's answer to Paris love-lock bridge. A must go for couples. A bit commercialized but a must go never the less. If you're up for it you can walk up but I took the cable car. It's so crowded in the cable car you won't get to enjoy the view
195,4.0,"It is not that hard to walk up to the tower. The view of the city is good. But if you go on public holidays, it is too crowded for a photo."
196,4.0,Namsan park and the Seoul tower were places on our must see list. For a small fee a cable car can take you from the base to the top of the park. The cable car ride was great since you get a nice view of the city and the park. If the weather was warmer I would have liked to walk instead. The top of the hill was great as well. The area around Seoul tower has great photo ops. On some days you can get a photo with a traditional guard.
197,3.0,"If you go during the Korean holidays, there's a lot of people. The cable car will be packed and the queue waiting period is about 30 minutes to an hour. During winter, I think you should skip cos there's nothing much to view. There's a viewing area for the public as well."
198,5.0,"The cable car ride was very crowded. If you're expecting something romantic, skip that. The N Tower is a very well managed spot to view the Seoul skyline. There is an indoor viewing area with seating open to public for free."
199,5.0,"we went at night and took the cable cars up to the top and the view is amazing, when visiting Seoul, this is definitely one of the many places that should see and take in the view which is a once in a lifetime."
200,5.0,It was cold but it was very very romantic. I recommend the bus to go up the hill and the cable car to come down instead. Trust me.
201,4.0,Nice panoramic view of Seoul from the top. I went by car so not sure how tiring the climb up would be on foot. Recommend if you like hiking.
202,4.0,"Great view of Seoul - very peaceful, enjoyable way to spend a few hours - dress warm in the winter, it is a bit windy and quite chilly, even during the day.   It is an uphill walk which is a bit steep at times (even with stairs), so wear comfortable hiking shoes."
203,3.0,Namsan Park is a typical tourist attraction and place for lovers to go to. It is good to go at night and then you can see the lights of Seoul from the top. Be prepared to pay for the cable car and also the entry ticket up the top of the tower. It was nothing special and similar to other attractions such as the Taipei 101 building.
204,4.0,"namsan park, seoul tower and cable car...went at night to see night scenery. walk from our hotel in myeongdong to namsan park. dazzling seoul tower at night and quiet walking trails in between the trees. the view of seoul up above is breath-taking. love pad locks everywhere. we paid tickets to go up the observance tower but was quite disappointed, so don't bother. watching the view from namsan park is better off than the observance tower."
205,4.0,"One of Seoul's green lungs is a high green mountain, rising in the midst of residential and office buildings.You can climb the many, many, MANY stairs to its peak (not recommended on a rainy day) or take the cable car for apx. 9 US$ return ticket.The park consists mostly of green pine trees, some pavilions and some ancient buildings.At the peak, there's the famous Seoul tower and the beautiful love lock trees.Don't miss the stunning view of Seoul from the cafe's terrace.A nice short visit to the park would take you apx. 90 minutes. For further exploration and climbing on foot - make sure you have at least 3 hours."
206,4.0,"if a mountain lover then this is for you,one of the highest peaks and a terrific view if the city .See the sunset its really mind blowing"
207,4.0,Good Overview of the city. View in daytime and night time are both amazing. Should have more variety of restaurants around.
208,4.0,"This is a nice place to escape the crowds. There isnt much to say about it... wide, paved walking paths. If you bring a dog expect that many other dog owners will NOT have their dogs on leashes which can cause problems. Keep your eyes open and there are a lot of hidden dirt trails. There are also some ponds, springs, and a small botanical garden. Sometimes there is interesting wildlife to see off the beaten path."
209,5.0,"It is possible to have a look around all area of Seoul at the top of mountain. There are several ways to get to the tower but I took a bus under the mountain. the buses heading to the tower run 3-5 minute intervals.Lots of tourists and local people are crowded all the times especially surrounding the fence of locks of which people hang on it. The fence is already full with lockers and also there is a locker key box to prevent people from throwing their keys on the mountain after locking. seems to protect the environment by that way well. some restaurants and souvenir stores are good to prepare some gifts for friends and family.Should you have lover, this place is worth to be one of the romantic times in your life."
210,5.0,"Mount Namsan is visible to visitors to central Seoul, especially if you are shopping around Myeong Dong. You can take a short shuttle bus ride there, in about 5-10 minutes, or you can take a leisurely uphill walk to the base of the Mount Namsan, then use the glass elevator to the actual cable car station. The park is like an oasis in the midst of the Seoul urban jungle. You get to enjoy the colorful autumn trees lighting up the whole landscape as you approach ! Whilst there is a rather long queue to the cable car ride, it's still shorter than the 20-30 minute trek uphill! At the hill top,  you will feel an sense of exhilaration as the scenery is even more beautiful , with a added bonus of the top of the world feel when you look down at the rest of Seoul... Take the high speed elevator ride to the top of Seoul Tower and you see the entire Han river, skyscraper Gangnam across the river and the historical areas of old Korea. There are regular traditional drum and dance performances at the Park and we were lucky to see one. Otherwise for coffee addicts there are quite a few cafés in the Tower for you to sit down and while away the rest of your day."
211,5.0,"I am amazed by the landscape and arcitectural design which make the entire place a good site for loving couples. My wife and I liked the place and we have also pledged our love with a pad-lock. Though the route to this place is tough, I believe with your loved one accompanying you, it will no longer be tough as we do it together."
212,4.0,"My wife visited me in Aug and we took the cable car up to Namsan Tower, it was much better than taking the stairs, nice view of the city as you go up the the car. I plan to visit at night and take some pics of the city lights."
213,5.0,there are so many parks in south korea. this park is good. the place is safe. people come here for dating and picnic.
214,4.0,"My husband and I were short on time and we took advantage of the funicular and the cable car to get to the top. It was a Sunday morning and the wait was not long at all. On November 2, the temperature was warm at the bottom and very chilly at the top, so prepare accordingly. It became increasingly more crowded as we were there, but that did not take away from the experience. We did a full circuit and the views were great from the park level. We did not go up in the tower."
215,4.0,"You can see the city view from the tower and would find a lot of way to show off your love to your sweetheart as they have love lock, love bench, love tiles...there. After reaching the observation deck, you should try Korean buffet that is yummy and special.A tip for taking cable car, try to stand at the end of the cable car, so you would see the whole beautiful view of city when it takes off.After that, you could take bus no.2 or walk (I walked) to the traditional Korean village nearby."
216,4.0,"My husband and I went in the middle of the week during the day so the place was pretty empty. You can easily catch a cab to the entrance of the park and take a 5 minute cable car ride up to check out the gorgeous views. They also had a few coffee shops and places to eat so we grabbed a beer and a kimchi hotdog for lunch while we were there. You can take an additional elevator ride to the tower itself for an additional charge, but we opted to stay at the park instead - the cost to go up the tower was around $20.00 US dollars. This place was surrounded by couples who also brought (you can also purchase) various ""locks"" that you can write your names on and hang. There were probably thousands of locks on various fences around the park. We also decided to take a stroll down the park instead of taking the cable car back down to enjoy the scenery. Great place to visit!"
217,4.0,Namsan Park is the highest natural viewpoint within Seoul City. Visitors can choose to hike up or take public transport. Hiking is relatively easy if ones enjoy the fresh air and greenery along the way.
218,4.0,"Great park, but did not like the long wait for the cable car. Definitely worth a visit, but those who get easily frustrated should consider other options getting there than the cable car. Also I think that you get most of this park if you visit it on day time. We were there when it was dark and could not see everything."
219,5.0,"Well worth the visit,on a clear day the view is amazing.We walked from Myeongdong station down a narrow road that runs from the right side of the Pacific Hotel (about 15 mins)to the cable car station.  We bought our lock and key set from the gift shop and wrote our message and attatched the lock to the ""fence of love"".We bought coffee and sat overlooking the beautiful scenery.We bought a return cable car ticket but next time will walk down to enjoy the park views,also plan to go at night and have dinner at the restaurant at top of tower."
220,4.0,"Namsan park is beautifully situated near city center with easy and quick access and doesn't require much preparation, you can go there for a nice 1 or 2 hours escape in nature."
221,4.0,"Cable car ride is great but if have more time, we would havewalk up. Can be quite busy when it is peak holiday time."
222,5.0,"It's a nice hike to the top (as long as you're not too unfit) or you can get the cable car.  Once at the top, the views of the city are amazing - you realise just how big Seoul is.  At the top in summer is different attractions like dressing up in hanbok (traditional clothing) and seeing the smoke signals.  There's usually artwork at the top and of course you can go up the tower (personally don't see the need as the views are amazing enough from the top of the hill and you don't have to pay for them!).  Bonus = coldstone creamery at the top and you can even get the bus back down!  If you go in winter, remember, it is FREEZING!"
223,5.0,A must see when in Seoul. Best time to visit at night time. Can get very cold starting august. There might be long lines at the cable car terminal. Restaurants in the area might be to pricey. Cool place for couples. There is an attraction and activity for couples.
224,4.0,Very nice to walk around and get a feeling for the place.  Make sure not to take life too fast and soak it in.
225,3.0,Located at the center of Seoul.  There are many small mountain trails around this mountain.  Recommended one is the trail from the entrance of National Theater of Korea to the departing station of cable car.  It takes about 30 minutes walk... helps to calm down in a busy city life.
226,5.0,"Nearly everywhere I went in Korea, I climbed a hill !, this was no exception. It was wroth the effort, views a bit restricted on the day we went due again to cloud and mist, but not as bad as it could have been. worth a visit, you'll enjoy it."
227,4.0,It's a bit of a hike going to here but you get a nice view of the City. I went to N tower and the Teddy Bear museum. there are also some artist that paints you while you wait and they are sooo talented!
228,3.0,"You cannot see much view because of the smog. Besides, it's very crowded. People, buses. On the other hand  -no private cars allowed in, which makes the walkin quite pleasant ,"
229,3.0,"We took the cable car to the top (8,000 won round trip), but to go to the top of the observation tower was an additional 20,000 won or something ridiculous.  It was a very smoggy day so we couldn't see much - it is probably best to go at night or during a clear day.  The compound at the top is designed for an expensive date - the love lock bridge, teddy bear museum, expensive restaurants, etc.  It's a short walk from Myeongdong and it was neat, but nothing extraordinary."
230,5.0,It is really fantastic to see the city view. Highly recommend to visit.
231,4.0,"From Myeoong-Dong Subway just head up the hill towards the cable car, then up the steps, turn left at the top and keep walking. 6km later you will have done almost a full loop and ended up at Hoehyeon Subway and Namdaemun Market.The path (and it's a full cemented path so no need for any special shoes or anything) is quiet, well shaded by trees, there are lots of flowers and the views are glorious. Was a nice morning"
232,4.0,"The park is beautiful and great getaway from the bustling city below.  My husband and I walked up the hill from the metro station.  It was a very warm, sunny day.  We were both sweating quite a bit, by the time we got to the park.There was some kind of event/festival going on, when we were there.  There was a stage, tents, loudspeakers, etc.  It would have been a bit more enjoyable and my review would probably be better without the noise and all the people.I will say the public bathroom was amazing; super clean, modern, spacious . . .  I was completely taken off guard."
233,5.0,"You can take the bus, or the cable car to go on top of the Namsan park, but climbing is by far the most glorifying. I can recommend 2 ways:- from myeongdong: steep stairway will make your legs burning and your butt hard ^^- from itaewon/Hyatt hotel, from scenic start through the gardens with 2 or 3 pretty steep parts through the trees (few stairs)Better when the weather is clear, but more quiet early morning and with light brisk"
234,4.0,"Nice overview of seoul city at peak especially when the sky gets darker and the lights are on... Consider taking namsan bus number 02, 03 and 05 at different route from seoul city that circles the mountain to avoid queing up for the cable car. We took bus 02 from seoul ani cinema which is 5 mins walk from our myeongdong hotel, and we get to see nice sceneries along the bus route before reaching the top. Moreover, its a cheaper option!"
235,4.0,"Be careful about going up to Namsan Tower by stairs when it is on winter time. The snow makes it very slippery and dangerous. There is an elevator which you can take to go up for Krw 8.000. If you are in a budget, there is a CU (convenience store) right near the buses stops. You can buy some snacks there, because eating in the tower might be expensive for students. Go there with your beloved one and experience the metal trees and bridges full with lockers. They engrave your names and you throw the key way down the cliff! It is a lovely experience. At night, the tower has different light colors, being interesting to take pictures. The view of the city might be compromised depending on the season Sometimes it is foggy because the Yellow Sand coming from China. It is worth to go up to the top and take a look. It is possible to see the Han River over there."
236,4.0,"Walk through this park on our way to seoul tower. Park was very clean and very new. Lots of plants still ""settling in"" with the help of some sticks for support."
237,5.0,"You really can't go wrong if even the locals frequent a place regularly, and no matter which path you take (some go past galleries, some past sport hubs, even an archery centre) you should end up at the top. This may take about 1-2hrs depending on your fitness. There's even a cable car for the feeble or impatient, and it runs well into the night.The best way: climb the hill late afternoon for a romantic sunset to light the scene for you and your lover to latch an eternity lock onto a whole wall of lover's locks around N-Seoul Tower, followed by supper in any of the restaurants at the top, then grab a gigantic ice cream in time for the lightshow. Afterwards either cable it down or skip the queues and stroll down hand in hand past the softly lit walls back to civilization."
238,4.0,"We visited Namsan Park in spring and although it was raining, it was a lovely oasis of relative quiet in a huge city.  We got the cable car up and walked back down the road."
239,5.0,We went up Namsan expecting it to be a little overrated however we were pleasantly surprised!We went fairly early in the morning (by Korean standards!). We took the cable car up the mountain and were up the top by around 10am. There were not that many people around yet which was really nice.The padlocks are very quirky and fun to look at. There are SO MANY!Going up the tower was a little pricey (again this is just compared to other things we had done so far which had been either free or $2-5 each) but we were very lucky to have beautiful weather and great views. Really gave us an appreciating for the view.Also had a fantastic lunch at the burger place at the bottom of the tower. Delicious.
240,5.0,"Second time I've been here and always crowded with people, you can go to the top of Namsan Tower using a lift-like-elevator from Myeongdong and cable car,for those who like to walk and want to enjoy the view can use stairs along the hill to the top..there's a garden of padlock where lovers put their sign of love and also observatory place at the top of Namsan Tower to enjoy great view of Seoul especially at night..it is a very nice place."
241,4.0,Pity about the smog but a pleasant visit here.  Take your time and walk back down to the Botanic Gardens if you can.  It's very peaceful and pretty
242,5.0,"Namsan Park is a great park  in the middle of the city and where you can walk or take the cable car up to N Seoul Tower. On the lower end, there are replica pieces of the wall that you can walk along, there are some statues and beautiful gardens. As you walk up the park to N Seoul Tower, there are great lookout points, nicely paved stairs with handrails in the steeper sections and a few places to stop for drinks along the way."
243,4.0,"It was a great place to relax, get fresh air, hiking for strong up body. From there, you may get to the N Seoul Tower by hiking or cable car (for easy and save time but have to spend for ticket). It was a great weather during early of April, feeling cold and fresh (about 15 degree Celsius). Ya, never forget enjoy the view during hiking to the N Seoul Tower. Love there"
244,4.0,"We didn't realize there was a park here, and it wasn't in our plans.  We'd taken the cable car up the hill, en route to the N Seoul Tower when we discovered this lovely pitstop.Always interested in history, we had to first check out the emergency smoke signal towers of Mongmyeoksan Beacon Hill, that were built in ancient times as part of a warning system to alert the community for approaching enemies.The park also contains a marker designating the precise geographical center of Seoul, which happens to be located here at 267 meters (875 feet) high. There are viewing decks in several places for taking pictures of gorgeous vistas of Seoul.  Trees that looked like red maples had fully bloomed in new foliage and were quite stunning.While we were awaiting our food order at one of the restaurants at the bottom of N Seoul Tower, we couldn't help but notice through the window a row of what looked like decorated Christmas trees.  And I couldn't figure out why there'd be decorated trees here (especially in April), so I went out to have a look.  The decorations were all locks ... the kind you open with a key.  Some were rusted, like they'd been there a long time.  Hand written notes (in Korean) on plastic tags were also hung all over the trees.  Now I was even more curious, but there was no explanation - at least not in English.After dinner, exploring more of the park, we found an entire walled area around a wooden deck which also contained locks, upon locks, upon locks ... thousands of locks all latched together with no keys to open any of them.  And more handwritten notes.  We finally found an English explanation.  These are ""love locks"" and are hung by couples (or friends) to symbolize the unbreakable bonds of everlasting love.So the park is full of beauty and mystery and history.  I'm glad we happened upon Namsan Park."
245,5.0,"OK gentlemen, here's a guide for you on how to take your lady on a romantic date to Namsan Park.  1.  Buy a lock and black marker and bring it with you.2.  Buy a one-way ticket and take the cable car up to the park.3.  Walk around and enjoy the foliage and views.  Take some lovely pictures with the heart-shaped flower boxes.  4.  Go to one of the locks of love decks, show her the lock you brought, write something endearing professing your love for her, and lock it in. (If you didn't bring a lock with you, the souvenir shops at the base of the tower have many--at a higher price of course)  5. Take the elevator to the top of N Seoul Tower to enjoy the views.6. Buy a postcard and stamp from the souvenir shop, fill it out together, and mail it to yourselves from the highest mailbox in Seoul.  7.  Have dinner one level below the observation deck at N Grill for a beautifully arranged and delicious buffet dinner with spectacular views at your table.8.  After dinner, stroll down the mountain for a lovely walk through the mountainside down to the city.  Make sure it's a nice day when you do this.  She'll love it!"
246,2.0,"Since is conveniently located in the Myeong-Dong vicinity, it makes a good destination to burn a couple hours, or just a taking break away from the bombastic shopping frenzy from the town."
247,4.0,Great day today.Took a walk from my hotel the Lotte and walked towards the cable car. Gave it a miss and took the stairs.Glad I had a pair of trainers on and sports gear as it's a tough walk 1.5 km of stairs but might even do it again tomorrow. Great weather great views and then went up the tower. Restaurants there we great as well.
248,4.0,"Lovely walk with beautiful trees and views.  Up at the top is the tower. We didn't go up, but had a great time walking around and looking at all the locks of love on the fence."
249,5.0,"Spend the money for a cable car to the top of Namsan park to enjoy the views of Seoul - and make sure you and your sweetheart bring a lock to add to the thousands already chained to the railings all along the edge! I was moved to tears by all those love locks - to the point where I basically skipped the beautiful views entirely. Be prepared for long cable car lines. Also, don't leave without eating a twisted potato."
250,4.0,"we have visited the park on Oct-2013, it is a very nice experience to see the scenery from the cable car. Although the cable car is a bit crowded but nevertheless it is a nice!we spend almost 2 hours at the park taking photos and walking around before we entered the N-Tower. It is a bit cold during the night time and we have decided to take the cable car for the return instead of walk.overall, i like the place very much and it is a must go place at Seoul!"
251,4.0,"There are many and varied views of the city from the park, which is steep in places. You can even get a free workout in one of the park's outdoor gyms!"
252,5.0,"A beautiful part of Seoul, the Namsan Park is the largest open space available and it presents many activities for every one.  The walkers can go to town in this park and discover their own path and enjoy the magnificent view of the city.  There is the Seoul Tower which is another fabulous point for panoramic views of the city.  The ride in the glass encased Namsan Oreumi is thrilling but short.  The Namsan cable car is another great outing experience, though a bit crowded.  For the biologists in you, the park represents a veritable gold mine for specially trees and plants. For health freaks there is a special acupressure trail.  There is a Teddy Bear Museum for kids and last but not least there is the love lock area and you and your loved one can lock up and throw the key away symbolizing unbroken love."
253,4.0,"Walking all the way up Mt Namsan is the way to go if you want beautiful scenery amidst the park landscapes. Signs were abundant along the route. It was a 1200 meter trek from the bottom of the hill with lots of steps along the way. Restrooms, rest places and even outdoor gyms can be found along the route. Once you reach the Jamduubong Photo Island platform you won't regret your decision to walk all the way up. Trust me!"
254,5.0,This park is in walking visit from our house.  There are many beautiful sights which give you the feeling of being outside the big city.  There are also several hiking trails in this area.
255,4.0,"Yes, you read that correctly, I walked up! It is a steep climb, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I think it helps that there's steps, as you can get some rest bite on the way up there. There is a cable car if you don't want to walk, but there is often a queue. Walking didn't take as long as I thought and you do feel better for it, honestly!When at the top you can go up the tower, I didn't, as the view is good from the base. The area can get busy at weekends. On the way down I walked down the very steep bit directly opposite the way we came up. Just a short walk and you can get the bus down. I got one back down to Seoul station using my T money card."
256,4.0,"Could have been clearer directions to take funicular from Myeungdong, then the cable car to the top.  Ended up hiking up to the park but did enjoy the views and the city wall."
257,4.0,"I made my visit to Namsan Park in the winter so I am sure I lost some of the experience that could be had during the summer. The park itself is relatively small, however, it serves as one of the gateways to the Seoul Tower. I believe half the experience of visiting the tower was going through the Namsan Park where you see a restored portion of the wall that used to protect Seoul and then climb alongside that wall all the way to the top of the mountain. It is a lengthy hike but, if you are physically able, it is very rewarding and offers a couple of very nice lookouts."
258,4.0,"It is convenient to go to Namsan Park.  Just take Line 4 and stop at 424.  You can get a route to go to the park.  If you wish, you can take the cable car.  But we prefer to have a climb to the peak.  On the way, you can enjoy the beautiful scene.  Also you can enjoy the famous Sakura."
259,3.0,"Namsan tower is a very good viewpoint to appreciate the vast city that Seoul is. The walk to the tower from the entrance of the park is very nice and has its own good views, but quite far. So bring some time, if you choose to walk. The entrance fee is quite high and there's a bit of a wait to get into the elevator. Once at the top you can enjoy all around views of Seoul and the mountains. Bring some patience though as it is busy on the viewing platform as well and very noisy. Photos can be a bit tricky to take, because of the reflections in the glass and the bright lights inside. It would be nice if they dimmed those. Overall a good place to visit in Seoul but not my first choice."
260,4.0,"The park itself is really very nice.  There are benches and exercise areas scattered about, plus some very well manicured landscaping and nice walking paths.  There are, as in much of the surrounding region, some very steep hills that can get a little tiring.  It is quite a long walk if you want to visit the Seoul Tower without catching a ride on a bus or the cable car (which is quite affordable and a fun thing to do as well).  The Tower itself isn't really as impressive at it seems from down below.  You can't go up to the very top, and the rotating restaurant is really overpriced.  The burger place there was really delicious, though.  They also have cultural shows that you can watch for free around the Tower.  It's definitely worth visiting, if for no other reason than to say you've been to the highest point in the country.The park itself, though, is someplace I could see myself walking to and sitting with a good book and a coffee when the weather isn't too hot or humid."
261,3.0,"We needed to kill some time in Seoul and it was a nice breather since its high enough to have some cool air, and quite moment.We took the cable car to add some scenery, if I had the energy, I would walk all the way to the top, the Park seemed very green and away from cities loud and crowded faces. If you make it to the top, make sure to go with an empty stomach, there is a nice burger place you can reward yourself after having climbed to high."
262,5.0,"Its a large network of hiking trails and scattered sights. It would take you days to see them all. Of course the highlight of the area is the seoul tower, which stands at the top of the park"
263,3.0,"This is a great place to go in the fall, you can see great views from all over Seoul and it gets really crowded so you need to pick and choose the times that you can go and see.. Summer is packed and its hard to find a place to see but its worth the views!! Transportation through buses are the easiest but t the same time choose non peak times to go and its a nice place to walk on a cool night!! Great for couples and picture taking.. There are many places to do some walking and hiking and there is a cable car that is cool to take too..."
264,4.0,"Not too much to do here but rest, walk and check out the cool art/ stores in the area.  Still, we REALLY enjoyed the green spot in the middle of the neighborhood.  Oddly, only one entrance"
265,4.0,I like this park because of the trees and the nice views of the city. It's a little loud for a place this nice.
266,3.0,"There are two options to get to the top of the hill to reach the tower - there is a cable car or you can walk.  With a cool weather and strong heart, the walk up the hill will be within most peoples reach, though the cable car is definitely easier.  For the kids there is a teddy bear museum underneath the Seoul tower, and there are historical displays in the courtyards on top of the hill.  On an observatory deck at the base of the tower couples have encrusted the guard rails with pad locks dedicated to their love.  The tower itself provides 360 degree views of Seoul, and indicate on the windows the direction of world cities.  Worth a visit if spending an extended time in Seoul."
267,5.0,We visited the park and tower primarily to have dinner in the revolving restaurant. The views were spectacular. Very busy with live music and dj's. Danicng at the base of the tower. Took a while to get the tram down due to the crowd but it was Friday evening.
268,5.0,The place is nice for a stroll with your love ones and observe the many different attractions within the park. Many trees to keep you cool and a nice view of Myeongdong
269,5.0,"We went up in the cable car to the park so we could see the views rather than walk up through the trees. It cost 8000 Korean won each for the return journey. We then went from the park up to the top of the tower for more stunning views of the city. A ticket to go up the tower costs extra. In the park, we had a good walk round, lots to see, padlocks, teddy bear museum, and then enjoyed the free cultural show at 1500 hours. This lasted about 40 minutes and was really fun: martial arts displays, weapons, a drumming display, ribbon twirling which was outstanding. Well worth going up there in the afternoon to watch these guys. We had really excellent ice creams from The Cold Stone, great flavours which are mixed as you wait and if you're lucky, one guy does some great tricks with the ice cream in the scoop!"
270,3.0,"This is not the most recommended site inside Seoul.If you have never been, it is worth a visit. Unless it is super hot, make sure to stroll down on foot.The restaurant at the tower is super expensive...eating not recommended here."
271,3.0,"Now before I even start, I went on a holiday weekend.  Big fat mistake.  It was my first time to Seoul and I read the reviews and was pretty excited to go.  We weren't sure how to get up there exactly, so upon asking one of the locals, the recommended the Gondola.  Oh boy... it took a good hour to even get on.  The line up was out the door and wound around three flights of stairs.  When we finally got on, they squish you in as much as they can, so it is kinda of hard to enjoy.  If you are small like me, you can squeeze in the front and see pretty well.  The good thing is, the ride back is not nearly as long a wait.  The one thing that definitely saved the trip was the awesome view.  Once you get up there, and even on the gondola, it is just awesome.  There are a lot of vendors and a few restaurants to enjoy when you are up there, but I was a bit disappointed to find that there is another fee to actually go up to the tower.  The view was awesome anyway, but it is a bit of a tourist trap.  There are a few stores you can visit and the such, but besides the view I was not super impressed.  Also be careful of the smog or fog levels, as it can affect your viewing pleasure.  Kind of a no brainer, but if that's all you came to see then take that into consideration.  All in all, not a bad experience, the tower looks stunning at night, but I was not blown away by any means."
272,4.0,"This was one of the ""musts"" to visit in Seoul for us, but we decided to go there on weekend. The line was terrible, more than hour of waiting, than sqeezed in the cablecar cabin with other visitors - and we are finally there.But there was one good side - near the tower there was an American army band performing - very cool! Probably they perform only on weekends. The tower inside was also very crowded, if you just want to see a view of Seoul, better go to Building 63."
273,4.0,Nice paths for walking and dominating the city from its highest point.Beautiful at night time whit city lights down there.
274,4.0,"Picturesque and many platforms from which you can take panoramic photos of Seoul. You could choose to take the cable car up but I'd suggest a hike instead; good exercise and lets you take in the sights along the way. Then say ""Hey, I climbed Namsan!"""
275,4.0,"We took the cable car up to the peak (8,000 one-way, 10,000 return) which only took a few minutes and was worth doing. Seoul Tower is great. We really enjoyed it and has a great view of the city/mountains. We went during the day but would be good at sunset so you get the best of both worlds. Apparently the tower is lit up blue on clear nights so you know it is a good night to visit. It was a bit hazy on the day we went but we saw lots. The cafe/toilets are all good. Service is ok. The lovers padlocks trees were a sweet touch so don't forget to take your padlock to leave your own memento. We walked back down instead of taking the cable car. It is a long way and pretty step though the steps are ok. I would recommend down rather than up. It's for people who are fairly mobile/active. You can drive up about halfway but have to walk up the rest of the way."
276,4.0,window into the past . gave a good representation as to lifestyles of days gone by. these are the original homes moved to this location and re-assembled for viewing.
277,5.0,"Namsan is a hill on the southern edge of old Seoul. It is reached by cable car or scenic walk. On its peak, which itself offers panoramic views of the city on a clear day, is the North Seoul Tower. There is a revolving restaurant at the top of the tower. The gardens are nicely laid out and Namsan is close to the semi-pedestrianised shopping district of Myeungdong."
278,3.0,"may be coz i'm asian who knowing oriental culture enough, i find no exciting with it. But if you are westerner you will find this place tempting"
279,4.0,"I wouldn't classify the route to Seoul Tower or Namsan a hike. It is more of a leisure walk and most people can do it even if not outdoorish type.My route starts from Hangangjin Station along Subway Line 6. Walk towards the direction of Itaewon and about 200m or so, you will find the entrance to the start of the trail. From there, it is wooden stairs up until you see an outdoor fitness corner. Continue until you pass Hyatt hotel and cross over to the other side of the road via a pedestrian bridge. This route is more of a nature route as you will walk through pine forest, a lotus pond or detour to see the wild flower garden. Once you reach the mid-point of the mountain, follow the road all the way to Seoul Tower. Along the way, you can see the view of Seoul city on the left (there is one viewing point along the way for photo taking). On the right, you can catch a glimpse of the partial old city wall which you will eventually walk pass. As you neared Seoul Tower, the road becomes really steep, but after you made it up, it is worth the effort because this route really allows to soak up the nature Namsan has to offer. It took us probably less than 2hours to complete this walk in our own leisure pace.We did a one way walk up Namsan. On the return leg, we took the cable car down to Myeongdong area."
280,5.0,"This park is like the space needle of Seattle or the Eiffel tower in Paris where you can get panoramic views of seoul. You can walk it but it's quite steep or take a cable car. What's interesting in this place is just like Paris and Italy , where as a couple you can bring your padlock and lock it with your initials and special date, attaching it to millions of padlocks that has become an attraction for young and old."
281,5.0,We had a great time and was lucky to catch a performance there too. The lovers lock area was really sweet and interesting. Great view of Seoul and we had totally delicious waffles!
282,5.0,Easily reached and a real jewel.  This park has great views and once you find your way around is a great days attraction.
283,5.0,A great place to view the city.  We especially like to arrive at  the summit around 1600 and watch the day turn to evening.  It is truly beautiful as the lights come on with all different colors and the traffic winding down below.  A cable car will get you almost to the top but be prepared for steep steps as you make your way to the top.  The Seoul Tower is a must as the view is even better.  The (Namsan means south) mountain is a great landmark that can be seen from most of the city and will always let you know which directions south  is.
284,5.0,"We made the trip by cable car to the top.  It is a very beautiful park with great views of Seoul.  By the views on the cable car, it looks that we may have missed a few sites to visit along the way.  Next time will try making it to the park on foot."
285,3.0,"It's like climbing a mountain. Walk, walk and more walk.View is okok from the top. Not much to see there."
286,4.0,"Went up the namsan hill on a public bus, and had dinner at the tower thereafter. Very nice place to sit down and enjoy the evening with loved ones. Price wise, reasonable for a dinner at the restaurant.  Go around 5:30pm  to see the locks and take some photos, watch the setting sun, and stay until about 8pm for the dinner."
287,5.0,We visited the tower and the park. The tower gives you a great 360 degree view of Seoul and the nighttime view is a light show. During the day the Namsan Park is a beautiful place to visit. You have many walkways and the landscaping is excellent. Since the park has many levels you can get good pictures of the city and the tower. People of all ages enjoy strolling around Namsan Park.
288,5.0,"I love the landscape and the trail you need to walk on to get there :). You get a beautiful view of the city the moment you reach the top. I like the huge monuments too. It's an amazing work of art. I also like the garden which has this huge stones arranged in a kind of circle and has writings on it. I am not sure if it is a chinese character though :P I never tried to ask :D. Over all, It was a great sight! :)"
289,5.0,"N Tower, not just the view,nice cool wind of the Autumn but also a great place for couple to have fine dinning at a reasonable price. 2 sets at the price of W235,000.We went there early this September. The weather was nice but the way up was very steep. But then ... You will still be able to see many old folk (local) tracking their way up from the foot of the hill! Kudos to them! There is a tourist bus that will bring u up to N Tower at a nominal price. There is not only the view but also another Teddy Bear Museum. According to researches done, there are 12 Teddy Bear Museums in Korea. All of them which houses different bears... Remember to check out the different types of packages to be purchased. Do not buy them separately as it will cost more. We bought the package with Teddy Bear Museum and Western fine dinning. You need to book the time of the dinner u want at the ticketing. We reached there at about 5pm, spent 2 hours at the Teddy BearMuseum. Our dinner starts at 7pm... The ambience was nice and the rotating floor lets u have a view of Seoul. We ended dinner at 10pm, as the last bus to leave N Tower was 11pm... Be sure not to miss the bus, else u will have to walk down... Walking down is definitely easier then upwards. But there is little street lights and can be dangerous if u are not familiar witht the surrounding."
290,4.0,We took the cable car to the bottom of the tower. It is a lovely area just to sit and relax. There were historical displays on the Saturday we were there. Great views and reasonably priced food available.
291,4.0,"The park is amazing and beautiful. Definitely worth a visit. If you don't want to pay the reasonable price for the ride up to the tower, you can certainly hike up the trail."
292,4.0,Liked - the cable car ride to the tower which gives you an excellent view of the park.  Very peaceful
293,5.0,"This has always been my favorite place. After the long climb, it is always a treat to look down at the lights that light up the city of Seoul!"
294,5.0,"Love the park! I was there during autumn and managed to catch sight of the beautiful red leaves. A lovely place for couple or families, if you are looking to have a good leisure stroll or even picnic. Some part of the of park is undergoing some constructions when I was there, but still it doesn't affect the view or anything."
