0,4.0,"We saw the old Seoul Station during our walk on Seoullo elevated walkway.  It was an older building that was converted into a rotating exhibit venue.  There was a permanent section consisting of a couple of rooms that detailed some of the architectural facts about the station as well as its renovation.  Some rooms were modernized while others still had the dark wood paneling and thick red drapes  harking back to its original status as the main transportation hub.In the other rooms were a number of different exhibits about the DMZ.  They ranged from photographs of soldiers, artwork interpretations, books of the DMZ, architecture and local vegetation.  I really did not expect to see that many exhibits but it was nicely curated and interesting.  Docents were available in each section if you had questions and display signs were in both English and Korean.Overall a very good use of a historical building."
1,2.0,"Visiting this old station may have 2 goals: looking at the modern art exhibition inside or get an idea of the building architecture. The first may probably vary as exhibitions are temporary, but while I was there they were… let say it politely: not worth the detour; the second is marginally more interesting, really nothing very interesting. Both have an advantage though: they will protect you in case of rain. If sunny, enjoy the building from outside, this is its best part. Good point, entry is free"
2,4.0,"The station is the main terminal for KTX and express services to Busan. The AREX airport express trains operate from here and go to both the Gimpo and Incheon International airports. The station is also served by the Gyeongbu line to various places in the country. From the central station, the Seoul Metro serves the station with Lines 1 and 4. Next to Seoul Station is the Lotte mart Discount store and the Galleria department store. The station is a very busy place – and the hundreds of travelers who use it are spoilt for choice with the various places selling snacks."
3,4.0,"We walked by on a Monday when apparently it is closed (there was a guard on duty and we did peer behind him when he opened the door - there appeared to be some art exhibit on the main floor). It is the old Seoul train station, replaced with the modern extremely boring building next door, repurposed as some sort of cultural center. The exterior of this structure is fascinating by comparison to the new stations being in a sort of eclectic style from the 1920s - almost wish we were going to be in town for an extra day just to see if its interior has been restored to the same standard. Certainly worth checking out in a city that is fast turning into just another glass box forest."
4,5.0,This museum has been used as Seoul station once upon a time. Now it has very interesting artwork inside. There are many rooms formed into exhibition centers with very interesting studies. It is worth visiting in Seoul.
5,5.0,"Really cool historical building right next to the newer Seoul Station. When I went , they had an art exhibit about the movement of time. It was fantastic. There was a variety of types of art and they all had explanations in multiple languages. There were even some interactive parts: kids could make origami sundials and there was one exhibit where you pedal a unicycle to operate the video installation. The upper level is dedicated to the history of the station and is worth a look, too."
6,3.0,"Old Seoul Station is next to new Seoul Station, worth going to take a photo because it is beautiful."
7,4.0,Again this is a great historical building to go look at located right next to the new downtown train station. You definitely get the feeling that millions of people have walked through there
8,4.0,Old train station revamped into a place for exhibitions. I'm glad they kept the exterior look of it. Must be grand in the old days.
9,4.0,It is old subway station. Nice design with grand look.There is lotte mall nearby the station.Also bus stop is just opposite the station
10,4.0,There was a Van Gogh art exhibition in January.  I passed by Seoul Station and found it amazing with people lining up to get in the exhibits.
11,3.0,"You can look around the station, but this station has little historic meaning, and the architecture is not so great. I do not want to recommend spend some time around this place, but you will see anyway because it locates in the middle of Seoul"
12,3.0,"The old Seoul Station completed in 1925 has been converted into an art space since 2011 called « Culture Seoul Station ». The real attraction of this building is its architecture. On two floors, there exhibitions, events, cultural performances, e.g.The visit is free of chargesNow, the new Seoul Station is a major railway station- The station is served by the Gyeongbu Line, its high-speed counterpart and the Gyeongui Line, with frequent high-speed, express, and local services to various points in South Korea.Around the building, a lot of shops and restaurants."
13,4.0,"Seoul Culture Station became a cultural center after the Korean railway changed to an enormous and modern construction next to the old one as it got developed. The old building then calls attention for contrasting with the modern buildings that surrounds it and offers an agenda of exhibitions and performances, usually free."
14,3.0,"It's a nice spot to be in, mind not the beggars that lives nearby, old buildings surrounded by many modern one. Hub of Seoul."
