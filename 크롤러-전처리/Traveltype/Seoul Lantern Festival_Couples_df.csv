1,5.0,This is a must if you’re in Seoul in November we went last night and it pretty amazing it’s about a couple of km long and you get to make a floating lantern
2,4.0,"We visited the Lantern Festival about 3 days ago. This year (2018) is the 10th edition of the Lantern Festival, running until 18th November 2018. Although the atmosphere is more colourful and carnival-like in the night time, nevertheless, it feels worthwhile even to see the artistic and detailed lanterns in the daytime when the Stream is quieter and with fewer visitors.At night, the western end of the Cheonggyecheon stream (near the Jonggak and Jongno-3-ga metro stations) gets lit up with these beautiful lanterns and crowded street stalls and activities at the street level. It becomes even more crowded on weekends with locals flocking to the carnival like event, so best to visit on a weekday. Taking a leisurely walk, you can probably cover the entire distance of the lantern festival (estimated about 2 km) in about an hour, while taking photos along the way. If you can avail more time, you can even, for a fee, buy a small lantern midway along the lantern festival, write your well wishes there, and then release the lantern on a designated part of the Stream.A good to visit activity during autumn season in Seoul. A nice evening walk venue after dinner. Good activity for the entire family."
3,5.0,This festival was amazing! So much good pictures to take. Street were packed! Lanterns and figures were beautiful
4,4.0,nice walk and interesting lanterns although most of the display was kids cartoon characters or corporate promotions in the form of lanterns.  where there were independent artistic displays they were great and the overall spectacle is very impressive. went on Sunday night and while it was popular the crowds were very manageable for a capital city event
