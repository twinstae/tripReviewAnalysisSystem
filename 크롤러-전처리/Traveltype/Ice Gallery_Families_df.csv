0,4.0,"It is hard, I guess, to have an ice-themed attraction in a building downtown somewhere, but the Ice Gallery in Seoul pulled it off quite nicely. While the space was a bit too small to fully enjoy it at leisure, the gallery does have several beautiful or amusing ice sculptures, including a whole car and the ever-popular ice slide. It was a fun and very frigid few minutes inside for our group. The colored lighting substantially enhanced the beauty of the exhibits.This attraction is best enjoyed in summer when it can provide a good respite from the weather outside. Although not a must-see attraction in Seoul, it is worth a look if you are in the Hongdae area and if your home country does not have a similar site."
1,5.0,"Visiting the Ice Gallery is like walking in an ice box. The interior has to be set below 5 degree to maintain the sculpture within. Visitors are supplied with towel blankets to keep themselves. In it on display various objects including living room, bedroom, igloo-like structure, tower, car and many others. Most popular are the ice slides where visitors can slide down. The exhibits are kept colourful with changing colored lights."
