1,4.0,"It's a mid range aquarium, not small not that much big, and full of families with kids. Specialy during weekends it's very busy and crowded, but koreans are very quiet and polite.You won't be regretful after spending one or two hours there."
2,4.0,I spent about 35 minutes total looking through the aquarium.  I think the price reflects the fact that the aquarium is in the middle of a city.
3,5.0,"When we arrived lical people told us there are 2 whales living in the aauarium.It sounded very strange but we said its worth check it out.Well, no whales of course!!But its really beutiful aquarium filled with all the fishes you can think of.Really recommended for anyone.And there are instructions in english as well!!"
4,2.0,I enjoyed the aquarium greatly and the animals were interesting and you can get really close to them. The reason for the two star rating is because the aquarium is way overpriced it's almost $30 just to see animals like penguins and turtles so it really wasn't worth the time yes it was beautiful and I enjoyed it too but save your money there are better places in Seoul â™¡
5,5.0,"This is very good for children. It is underground. So you can have a plan under bad weather conditions.  There is beautiful Budhist Temple, Bongjeongsa Temple where the ""Monk Exam"" was held. Actually Aquarium is the very place of Exam. :)"
6,4.0,"Very easy to find, it is within the Coex complex. It displayes some rare and not so rare fish and the best ones are the Sharks, so close to the visitors."
7,5.0,The COEX Aquarium is located at the Coex Shopping Centre where you would never expect to find an aquarium. The displays and fish are very nicely presented. One of the best Aquariums I have been to.
8,4.0,"If you get tired of shopping check out the aquarium! I was pleasantly surprised by how big it is. It took me about 2 hours on my own. It might take longer with children. There are a number of fun exhibits including one where they turned everyday objects into fish tanks. They made a refrigerator, washing machine and phone booth into tanks. They are really cool. The aquarium has manatees, sharks, seals and more."
9,3.0,Visited the Aquarium to kill time. It is more suitable for young children than grown ups. Had a good display of different species of fish though. The live Penguin feeding was interesting.
