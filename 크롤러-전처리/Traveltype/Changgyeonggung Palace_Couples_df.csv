0,5.0,"I love its peaceful grounds, one can appreciate the beauty of this palace. The greenhouse is interesting. Less touristy than Gyeongbokgung Palace. I'm sure this palace is perfect especially in Spring time."
1,4.0,"This palace stands next to the Changdeokgung palace and is smaller and less impressive. There is a wall separating the two palaces, with a gate. The palace gardens are vast."
2,5.0,We watched the changing of the guard ceremony which was fabulous! The uniforms and clours were amazing
3,5.0,Interesting place with a super change of guard ceremony tht happens at 10am and 2pm. must see and visit. rent hanbok outside and even get free entry into the palace
4,5.0,"The four palaces in Seoul each have unique  and intriguing histories. This palace is one of the smaller out of the four but is directly beside Changdeokgung, so one could easily spend a day visiting both. There are stairs and fair amount of walking."
5,5.0,I love all the traditional palaces in Seoul. They are so beautiful and you can see how it was like before during the joseon times.
6,5.0,It is part of these spectacular palaces showing cold traditional architecture that are worth visiting.
7,4.0,Certainly well worth the time to visit. Well developed site with good services. They even offer free tours. Particularly charming are the people who wander around in traditional clothes
8,5.0,"Visiting the palace grounds was like going back in time. I have watched several chinese movies about the Forbidden City in China and because of the design, you can see the Chinese influence on the artitecture."
9,5.0,The Palace tour was part of the Discover Seoul tours. Thumbs up.The arqutecture and colors you expect from Korean culture
10,4.0,"The palace here is one of the major sites of Seoul, and doable with the Seoul palace card - but it’s only worth that if you plan on visiting every single site included. We didn’t have enough time for that, so merely opted for this palace as the one closest to our hostel as well as the one with the most affordable entry prices. In the main courtyard shortly after we arrived, they began some kind of show reenacting court situations in the palace, but it was all in Korean with no translation. These shows continued throughout the outsides of most of the buildings; as with most palaces of this kind in East Asia, you can only explore the grounds, not the inside itself. The grounds are nice though; as well as the palace buildings themselves there is also a fairly extensive park, and everything is signposted in Korean, Mandarin, and English - with guidebooks available in other languages as well. There’s enough to explore to last a good few hours, and another palace links to it on the side; other than that there’s only one exit back outside though - which was annoying as we were hoping to cut through the block, but you need to buy another ticket to the adjacent palace for that."
11,5.0,"In the middle of the old city center,wylking distance from many hotels.Nicely restored buildings.English language tour at 15.30 at no extra charge most interesting."
12,4.0,A great place to visit. Buildings are impressive but mostly closed so you wander round the site looking at them from the outside sadly.
13,4.0,"Consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD) and be sure to pick up the English brochure at the entrance.Originally the palace that was on this location did not have a garden.  Now there are gardens and a pond on the grounds as well as a grand greenhouse.  Less people seem to visit this palace, it is less crowded."
14,4.0,"Rented from HANBOKNAM (Korean Traditional Dress) The shop is messy due to the volume (tourists), but they do have a system and u must be comfortable gg through the process of picking, changing, hairdo, keeping bag in lockers and finally able set off. From the shop it is also easy to head over to the palace, bukchon village and Samcheongdong culture street (all within walking distance and do not need to take train).Purchasing from Klook with rebates is cheaper! *The palace is not as awesome as Beijing’s forbidden city."
15,5.0,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
16,5.0,"If you are a history or architecture buff, then this palace is one to visit. There are many similar around Korea, but the ones in Seoul are absolutely worth the visit. A maze os smaller replica buildings give you tons to look at and the gardens are also beautiful."
17,3.0,"Interesting campus of ancient Korean buildings, many of which were destroyed during the Japanese invasion (late 1500s).  We spent a couple of hours there.  Not as impressive as Gyeongbokgung, but worth a visit if you have time."
18,4.0,"Not to be confused with the neighbouring palace Changdeokgung, this palace is much smaller and quieter.  However the buildings are just as beautiful and you can get many more photos without hundreds of people getting in the way.Worth visiting both palaces at the same time as they are next door to each other."
19,5.0,This is a nice place to go and explore Korean History. Everything is worth taking pictures at. Lovely place to know how the olden heritage of Korean royalties have lived and stayed in this Palace. Worth your time to see and visit!
20,3.0,"Well, we spent three hours including Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace. They are alike. Architecture and structure are too similar."
21,5.0,"A must see backed with a long history of Korea this palace was huge and beautiful. it was amazing, mystical and beautiful. The 'Daeonsil' Victorian Greenhouse was amazing with beautiful atmosphere. it is a must see when you visit Korea!!! and dont forget the pond it was magical."
22,4.0,"This was a very good visit, we had a student guide us around the Palace and it was worth it.  It was free as well.  a Couple of hours you need."
23,5.0,This is a very good starting point in Seoul’s palace visits. Here you can see a unique Korean architecture and how a palace is distributed within the landscape.
24,3.0,"This is a small palace in a peaceful setting backed up to the larger one and worth  the stroll, it can be seen all with in 30 minutes."
25,3.0,"Austere, lacked spirit. It appeared to be modelled on a famous site in China.  Sadly, I left disappointed with my visit but to be fair, it was also snowing.."
26,3.0,"We walked here from where we stayed. As it was late, we only managed a quick look.Nearby is the Changdeokgung Palace.  After viewing the more popular Gyeongbokgung Palace, this palace is rather small and worth a visit only if you have time."
27,4.0,Located close to central area. changgyeonggung palace is beautiful and good for taking pictures. not much crowd. so it is peaceful. 1 hour is enough for this spot.i visited all the palace in seoul and all looks similar. so instead of visiting all you can visit 1 or 2.
28,3.0,"Interesting history that goes with this place.  Reminds me of the forbidden city in Beijing, China.  Easy walking."
29,4.0,"This is a smaller palace, with a great wooded area to walk around, it features a large lake with carp and ducks. Unfortunately, the esteemed green house is currently closed until NOV 10 2017. Although it appears that some of the plants have been moved out on display, which is nice."
30,4.0,We went on our own but would suggest to go on a tour. The palace is really nice and it is a bonus that you see all the wonderful costumes of the culture. You see all of their beautiful clothes. There is great architecture and the grounds are just beautiful.
31,3.0,"It is MUST see attraction, however it is not very special. Some of places were closed when I was there. This is important for Korean history. Location is very good and close to subway."
32,5.0,"We recently enjoyed a tour of this magnificent Palace built in 1484.Many of the buildings were destroyed by fire a number of times & were restored in 1834.This is a huge Palace right in the heart of the City & only a few meters from the Subway @ City Hall Station.We were really lucky as the recent Tuesday we were visiting the Palace - there was a huge ceremony being performed by dozens of very visually dressed soldiers in a multiplicity of vibrant colours.The Parade was watched by 100,s of young school children & some visitors including my partner & I.After the parade we were allowed to have lots of photos with the various soldiers in their colourful costumes.Afterwards we completed a tour of the Palace  grounds & the beautiful Cherry Blossoms & other flowers that adorn the Palace Grounds.Additionally, many people hire costumes & have their photos taken by their friends & visitors alike.Very very colourful.The Palace has many superb buildings & were a pleasure to visit & enjoy.Highly recommended when anyone is visiting Seoul in South Korea"
33,5.0,This palace is great and have a big garden inside. Very nice place for photo taking. The palace is very clean and have a rich history behind it. Do come early as it closed at 5pm.
34,5.0,A grand site of the palace and also witnessing the changing of the guard every day. (We witnessed the 1pm). Its free to roam around the courtyard but to enter further there would be an admission price. Definite must see for first timers.
35,4.0,"We went to Changgyeonggung Palace in early April as we were told that this is the Palace with the most cherry blossoms during Spring time. We were somewhat disappointed that we did not get to see as many cherry blossoms as we had hoped for (even though there were some very nice cherry blossoms still when we visited); perhaps we were a few days early or late after the full bloom.As it was sunny and hot in the daytime even in Spring, would recommend to visit the palace grounds in the early mornings or in the late afternoons.Would also recommend to rent a hanbok and wear to the palace grounds. For 10000 won for 2 hours, you get a more memorable experience of what it was like to live in the palace and wearing traditional Korean clothes. What's more, it's free entry for those wearing hanboks (otherwise, you would need to pay 1000 won per entry at each palace). We did not feel strange walking down the streets in our hanboks, as it seemed normal for tourists and even locals to wear hanboks to visit the palaces. The hanbok rental shop closest to Changgyeonggung Palace, is a 10min walk from the Palace. After alighting from Hyehwa subway station, take exit 4. Thereafter, walk down Daemyeong-gil shopping street for about 200 metres until you reach a major road, Changgyeonggung-ro. Cross the road. Walk down about 30 metres until you reach a black-beige building (photo enclosed). You should find a banner on the building advertising for hanbok rental. The shop is on the 4th floor, reachable only by stairs. The lady owner is very friendly and can speak simple English, and she will gladly assist you on how to wear the traditional hanbok.After renting your hanbok, walk down the same direction for another 10 minutes until you reach the Changgyeonggung main gate entrance, and enjoy your walk around the Palace. In your hanbok, you could also enter Changdeokgung Palace for free from the back of Changgyeonggung, via Hamyangmun gate."
36,5.0,"this place is HUGE. right across the street is a Rental Shop where you can rent a Hanbok, and enter Changgyeonggung palace for FREE (if you are dressed in a Hanbok}. take snap all you want inside the palace in your Hanbok. Good Fun"
37,5.0,"love the roof lines, the colorful corbels, etc. - great photo ops.it was originally built as a secondary palace to the main one. The buildings are constructed of wood and set on stone platforms. Many feature tiled hipped roofs with a corbelled multi-bracket system and ornamental carvings. Simply delightful.The palaces were burnt down during the Japanese invasion in the late 16th century. This was the first one to be reconstructed, and since then served as the main seat of the dynasty for 250 years."
38,5.0,"I liked this Palace more than Gyeonbokung. It is very big, I've been there twice and missed the secret garden both times."
39,5.0,"This is a MUST visit place in Seoul. I had been to this palace 2 times and still want to go back again. To be honest, I prefer this palace even more than Gyeongbokgung Palace. Don't miss the Secret Garden tour as all the hidden gems are inside. Most of every corner in the secret garden tour are picturesque. The best season for visit (in my opinion) is fall when all the tree are red. Again, don't miss this place!!"
40,4.0,"Neat place to visit, but if you have to choose between this and Changdeokgung palace, go to the latter. If you want to visit the Secret Garden within the palace complex, you should reserve your tour tickets in advance, especially if you are going during a popular tourist season. Rent a hanbok from one of the stores across the street to heighten the fun and to receive free admission."
41,4.0,Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping. Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views.
42,3.0,"The Palace is nothing special. All temple and palaces have been poorly renovated 5 years ago, It is somehow a must see but do not expect to much. Nothing really to see and they all look the same."
43,4.0,"Right next to changdeokgung palace and you can enter it just by the secret garden area is this palace, cost is 0,8 euro and as normal in seoul free english guide, we had the last one of the day at 16:00 so just a few people left. Is quite big actualy and nice to see, the guide was very good and the tour lasted for over a hour.Overall worth a visit if you have time."
44,4.0,"Personally, I've about had enough palaces, but, this one is pretty darn impressive, and I guess you really can't go to Seoul and skip it."
45,4.0,"Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. Palace seems to be similar to other ones so Its really useful to have a guided tour which explain all the differences and show you what makes this one really different from the other 4."
46,5.0,"The palace is quite lovely, especially the painted buildings and ceilings.  But the real bonus is he Secret Garden which is lovely.  Take the guided tour of both and you will learn history while you enjoy the beauty of this place.  A couple hours is all you need."
47,5.0,We visited one morning and were just in time for the English speaking tour. We were the only two on the tour and the tour guide was very informative and friendly. She made it such a pleasant tour. We spent most of the day here as there is a lot to see and also places to relax. There is a botanic garden with a greenhouse but the green house was under renovation and so it wasn't open.
48,4.0,"By chance, we visited this palace before the adjacent one, Changdeokgung. Doing the reverse would possibly not be as enjoyable, as Korean palace buildings are very similar and Changdeokgung is he grandest of them all. This one, built to house the relatives of the king, had very few visitors when we were there. It offers an elaborate ceremonial bridge over the symbolic river (okcheongyo), large park areas, a very poetic small lake with an middle island and plenty of ducks, a small peculiar monument in the forest (taesilbi) and at the far end of the park, a wildflower garden and a Victorian-style greenhouse (under renovation until November 2017)."
49,4.0,"We only had time for one of the two major palaces, and we chose Changgyeonggung because royalty had actually lived there and we thought it would be a little less crowded. We also wanted to see the ""secret garden,"" which you have to book online in advance. We had guided tours of the central grounds and the very unique gardens. It was quite a lot of walking, which could be problematic in very hot weather, although the garden is very shady. We loved getting a taste of royal life in this last of the Korean dynasties. There is even a house where the last member of the family lived until the 1980s. The palace is also right next to Bukchon Village, another good site."
50,5.0,"Just been there this afternoon under a very rainy day unfortunately. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the walk with some photo shoots. The lush greenery and accented with colourful flowers made our day worth the wet stroll. The cold wind chilled our body but we didn't give up admiring all the historical wooden architecture and amazing stone works that adorn the entire place. They also offer English tour guide to let you understand better about its history.The entrance fee is very cheap (W1,000) and the entrance is close to hyehwa metro station line 4."
51,3.0,"I have visited many palaces in Asia, and this one for sure is not the most attractive. However is part of the story of the Country, and just for this reason worth for a visit."
52,5.0,"This Palace offers English-language tours, as well as tours in other languages: Korean, Mandarin and Japanese. The tour lasts one hour and is included in the price of the ticket. Our tour guide gave a lot of information about this palace. It is possible to visit this palace without a tour. Allow at least an hour. The palace is free to people 65 and older."
53,4.0,Spring is definitely a great time to visit any Palace in Seoul as the spring blossoms in full bloom are so love!y and plentiful.  I would also imagine a fall visit would also be as spectacular as the the autumn colours take hold.  The grounds are very ?argeso plantjme to walk around.The Palace itself is quite nice and was designed primarily as a residence for elders of the royal family to live.  Beside to pick up the brochure explaining all this as you go through the entry way.  It is very cheap to go in and free if you're 65+.This Palace is defiy worth a visit.
54,5.0,"Lovely piece of history, beautiful palace and great tour guides, highly recommended. There is an entrance fee, but it's not too unreasonable."
55,5.0,"There are four major Palaces in Seoul, and you can get a combined ticket to see all four and Jongmyo Shrine.  All are in pretty much the same area - in fact Changgyeonggung (there's really no need to add the word ""Palace"", as ""gung"" means ""Palace"", but the guidebooks do it to make it easier for English speakers like me!) is right next door to Changdeokgung, and there's an entry between the two (with a ticket office - you need to have the combined ticket book [10,000Won] or buy a ticket for both, but at least you don't need to go back out and walk round the wall to the other's entry!).All Palaces are readily accessible via the Metro.This one is smaller than a couple of the others, but still very pretty, in good condition, and with pleasant gardens."
56,5.0,Good for walking around and soaking up korean culture. Has a variety of buildings and is very pretty in spring and autumn.
57,4.0,"This is a truly beautiful palace in the middle of downtown Seoul! We froze our toes off, but it was worth going anyway! Be sure to not miss it."
58,5.0,Do not follow tourist guides telling you to use metro station Hyehwa line 4. There is an entrance through the Changdeokgung palace. Lovely place. Do not forget to visit the green house as well. Very relaxing walk through the park. One of the many superb Seoul monuments.
59,5.0,On an icy cold day in December with the airport FREE Seoul Tourism Board bus tour with lunch. Loved the palace tour and tour guide was excellent.
60,4.0,This palace is smaller than Changdeonkgung and Gyeongbokgung but is well maintained and has fewer European tourists. It is easily assessable from the east side of Changdeonkgung palace either from the street or through the palace its self. The entrance fee minamal (1000 won) and well worth a look although not as impressive as other palaces.
61,3.0,"This is not as great a palace as you might find in a place like China, but this is certainly worth including in your Seoul visit.  I've been here a couple times, and still recommend it."
62,5.0,"Beautiful palace in a quiet and nice park...With a bit of luck you can see Korean girls in traditional dress too.Don't hesitate to take the audioguide, it is really informative."
63,5.0,The grounds seem endless and building after building is in great condition. Walk around the complex to get a true feel for the space.
64,5.0,"Changgyeonggung is another palace of main 5 palaces. Also, it's smaller than Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung and very similar to other palaces. But if you like traditional buildings, Changgyeonggung is a must place to visit in Seoul. Not only you can see traditional buildings, but also you can sit near those buildings and eat your snacks or lunch. Also, it's like a park, so you can feel free to imagine that you are on picnic. I visited palace in rainy stormy day, but it still was very beautiful. And you can see a lot of korean couples with traditional clothes and elder people drinking soju. It's really nice place to feel old Korea and feel the nature~"
65,4.0,We just made a quick visit to put a tick on the to do list. it was attractive and gave some good foto shots!
66,4.0,"We were there at 3:30 PM and avoided the crowd and enjoyed ourselves roaming around the grounds taking pictures of the beautiful architecture/landscape (and some Koreans in their splendid Hanbok) . A very grand & beautiful palace. We missed the English tour & joined the Korean group to the Secret Garden. (you are required to be accompanied on this 90-min tour). After 10 minutes, my husband and I asked to catch up with  the English one and were ""allowed"" to do so. Beware of steep hills / steps inside the Secret garden - wear comfortable shoes. Our tour guide walked fast and we were ""out of breath"" on some parts."
67,4.0,We enjoyed the tour of the Palace in English but found the over-hyped Secret Garden disappointing. There was a huge group of us and it felt we were all being herded and the grounds had nice trees but little atmosphere with all the people.
68,5.0,The best preserved of the five palaces of the nose on dyansty and is world heritage site by unesco . It's Good to go on a tour so you learn the history of the palace . They have tours in English at only certain times of the day we went at 4 pm
69,5.0,"Fantastic, great history,can get up close to the houses,can't go inside but a great view and photo opportunity from the outside.We had a guide who was so knowlagble with his history, we were fascinated with the information."
70,5.0,"Recommend to go for the secret garden tour. We caught the English tour and boy it was a sight to see. Apparently you are not allowed to go in without the tour guide. The guide was really good and we were immersed in the past as we visited places the kings used to sit with his men and drink tea and where princes used to read etc. If you could only go to one palace, please do visit this one. Its also less touristy than Gyeongbukgung Palace."
71,4.0,"The palace served as the residence for three dowager queens so when you look up to the ceiling in the throne hall, there is a pair of phoenix , unlike the other 3 palaces where you see a pair of dragons. As with the other palaces, first you enter through the main entrance where the ticketing office is, then you go through the door leading to the Throne Hall.  In the big open courtyard, there are 2 rows of stone markers where court officials had to stand according to their ranking and waited to meet the king. The Throne like in the other palaces is the place where kings are crowned, met foreign envoys and court officials to conduct affairs of the state. There are many tall pine trees so it is very cooling walking in the park after visiting the Throne Hall. You would not miss the octagonal seven storied stone pagoda and the Chungdangji pond.walking further to the back, you would not fail to see a white wooden building, the botanical glasshouse. Going inside, you will be impressed by the many bonsai on display."
72,4.0,Like most palaces in Seoul with the same architecture. Needs only one hour to go around . It was not crowded and was easy to reach. The information given was mostly in Korean and we had to ask for English pamphlets.
73,4.0,"The change of guards ceremony is colorful and loud with drums and draws a crowd.As you walk through the different sections all the way to the back where the ladies resided you realize how spare and bare life was. No toilets, limited heating/cooling."
74,5.0,"compare to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I much preferred this one! It's less visited as it's less popular, therefore it's so serene, quiet and simply majestic. It's referred as the East palace of Gyeongbokgung and what makes this East palace so much more special is how all the buildings of Changdeokgung blend perfectly with the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it- therefore all the structures of this palace have a perfect flow with its own natural surroundings.Breath taking palace and far less crowded so you can really take your time to take it all in!"
75,3.0,"I have to say, the Guards were all actors. It was OK to watch but you have not missed anything if you missed it."
76,4.0,"MRT: Exit 4 of Hyehwa Station, walk for 10mins.Glad that we book the city walking tour at visitseoul.net for a free tour guide!"
77,3.0,This place is huge but we lack to enjoy it... Maybe because the huge grades were death because the temperature and the buildings were very simple compared to other palaces. I'm sure that in other season the huge parked are great places for a picnic.
78,3.0,I visited here in the depths of the Korean Winter when the temperature was seven below zero so perhaps I wasn't in the best of moods to traipse around a temple compound and keep bumping into loud Chinese tour groups. I'm not the biggest fan of temples or religious history and I didn't think this place was anything special. I was bored within half an hour.
79,4.0,so we basically had to navigate the palace on our own.  There aren't a whole lot of English signs so it's pretty hard to learn the history.  I definitely suggest joining the English tour to get the full exposure of the Korean history.  Admission is really cheap.  I think its worth the visit if you're going to Korea anyways.
80,4.0,One of major castle in Seoul . We were lucky to make it on time of Changing guards . Please check timings before you go . Located nearby many subway stations . Must visit place while you are in Seoul
81,4.0,"Love to see Changgyeonggung Palace,  where the well preserved history is every-where you look. So important that Korean still see the value of keeping this palace in such good condition,,centuries  of history.  We observe the guard changing ceremony it is something that we recommend the costumes the drams, the whole guard changing ceremony  so well organised , tourist have to wait until all the guards are inside. It feels that you are really travel in time and we were privilege to witness this and much more,,,,  the rest is to your imagination or you can visit this amazing place."
82,5.0,"It was the last day of our first trip to Korea. We ended up spending most of the day at Changgyeonggung Palace--going in in the morning, out for a short lunch and back again until the sun started to set.We preferred the serenity of the palace gardens to the boisterous crowdness of Nami Island. With very few tourists to jostle with, we took our time to stroll through the palace grounds. I was able to shoot beautiful autumn scenery as well as people--from school kids to senior citizens. I was especially lucky to chance upon people wearing hanbok. We plan to revisit the palace next time we are in Seoul."
83,5.0,"We went to the adjacent Changdeokgung Palace and as we arrived realized that we had been there years earlier. We paid the entry fee and went in anyway. About two-thirds into the compound, next to the entrance of the Secret Garden, was an entrance to this palace. We paid the 1000W ($1) per person entry fee and were glad we did. The grounds were beautiful. I enjoyed it more than the other which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, but seemed stark and bare. We did not visit any of the buildings and were happy just to walk the grounds. The contrast of the modern skyline to the ancient buildings added to the uniqueness of this place."
84,4.0,We visited the palace and the gardens. It is a small area to visit but very good. We went just at the start of autumn in Seoul and had great colors. it is a great value for money.
85,5.0,"The palace was a great relaxing option, easily accessible from Anguk metro station, and has beautiful traditional and historic korean building style palace, it's very spacious and has beautiful trees, once there don't forget to take a tour of the beautiful residential area next to it, and then go enjoy the rest of the day at Insadong market, all within a few minutes walk from each other."
86,5.0,"Changgyeong Palace is one of the Five Palaces that you must visit if you are in Seoul. It is next to Changdeok Palace (they are actually connected) but there is a separate admission fee. My advise is to buy the cumulative ticked that allows you to visit all the palaces for a reduced price. Enjoy the peace and the tranquillity and stay as much as you like! (If it's summer time, bring a hat or un umbrella!)"
87,5.0,Small but very elegant palace yet posessing sad history during the Japanese invation. Escape from the haze of Seoul and enjoy the traquility at the 'TongMyoungJeon'- Queen's bedroom. A Must visit palace in Seoul. Highly recommended.
88,5.0,"For the minimal cost of entry why not visit?Even after walking around the adjacent Changdeokguang Palace, we were not disappointed. The grounds are an easy walk and not many visitors were there. The ancient sundial in the hillside walk gave the time accurately with the correction applied. The place has a lot of history and efforts to preserve it are appreciated."
89,3.0,"This was the fourth Seoul palace on the UNESCO list that I visited and by then, I was having trouble distinguishing them. Still, I had an enjoyable walk there, but do not be expecting anything too great."
