0,3.0,"The Palace of Shining Celebration was completed in 1623, but destroyed during the Japanese annexation. Even the historical plaque states: “Even though some parts of the former Palace were reconstructed, the present palace looks very different from its original features.” So-o-o-o why would one want to visit? Perhaps because the walk southeast along Jeongdong-gil is so pleasant."
1,3.0,"Not particularly significant compared to the other palaces, but still worth a visit if you want to see Seoul History Museum or the 'Hammering Man' statue nearby."
2,3.0,This palace is the smallest (much of it was torn down by the Japanese) but it is free and peaceful and next to the excellent history museum so well worth a visit. Not much to see so it will just take about 15 minutes.
3,5.0,"This is one of those palaces that people don’t know much about.  No crowds, nice and very relaxing visit and it's free.  Supposedly one of the haunted palaces in Seoul and it is convenient to the Seoul Museum of History."
4,4.0,"This may be the smallest of the five palaces, but it's certainly no less beautiful. It's set up like the others, just on a smaller scale. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend it if you're in the area."
