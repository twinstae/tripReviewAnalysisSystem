0,5.0,"Most of foreign tourist is really familiar with Namsan Park with its cable car and beautiful Seoul's view from the mountain. But, for domestic, there is one similar spot near Dongdaemun, it called Naksan Park. There is China's Great Wall miniatur and you can stroll along this wall to get the peak. The other way, after arriving at dongmyo station exit 10, you can take local green bus no.3 to Naksan Park directly, more efficient for family trip... :)"
1,4.0,"We were there mid September and the temperature was around 25Â°C but the wind was cooling. We started our walk from the Seoul City Wall Museum, which is minutes walk from Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9. From there, we walked along a section of the remaining city walls. There are steps along the walls, though some parts have uneven steps. After about 20 minutes into the walk, we reached Ihwa Mural Village where we 'pit stop' to walk around the village to enjoy the numerous murals and arts scattered in the village.From there we continued our walk towards Naksan Park. It was a pleasant walk and from the crowd mix, it can be seen that this park is one of the favourites among locals to enjoy the sunset. We reached the peak just in time for sunset and stayed until the sun has set, when the lights on buildings began to light up this beautiful city.We descended the hill by walking along the city walls and reached our starting point, near Dongdaemun Station, Exit 9.Overall, it was a nice and pleasant walk. Would recommend visiting the park for the sunset at the peak."
2,3.0,"This park is relatively easy to find, as it is very near HyeHwa station. The park is quite quiet, and there is a tiring climb to the 3 observations points. The summit has a very nice view of the city."
3,5.0,This is part of the old city wall in Seoul. The walk up to the wall at the top of the hill is very steep  but worth the effort.  From there you can walk downhill along the wall to Dongdaemun gate
4,5.0,"City walls in Joseon Dynasty still remain partially in Seoul. And this park is locating inside the remaining walls.- Locating on a hill, seniors may have difficulties. But, it's worthy of visiting with a great cityscape of Seoul and walls.- Accessible from Daehakro(Hyehwa Station) and Dongdaemun CIty Wall Park (Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station).- There's Ihwa Mural Village nearby and it's good to visit together."
