1,5.0,"It so a nice trendy place for youngster. Lots of food. We stayed in an AirBnB at Hongik. Nice neighborhood with lots of nice cafe. One of it is the Bread Comma, must visit if your are there. I would rate it 5/5. Just nearby is the Hondae with lots of young people during the weekends. And your can also find the famous Kyochon chicken there too."
2,5.0,Really nice shopping street especially at night time when the shops are fully open and talented performers lined the street showing off their dance moves and singing talent. Great place to shop for apparels and accessories.
3,3.0,Hongdae I’m sure is a great and lively place to visit. We made the rookie error of going at 9.30am one Sunday. It was a ghost town. I guess it wakes up in the afternoon and certainly the shops were closed until 11.30. So just time your visit accordingly!

13,4.0,"It was really busy. Bustling to be exact. There was a cafe or something called **Tiger and I've never seen a line this long. There are a lot of restaurants and retail stores. The layout of these neighborhood streets are unique here in Korea, but once you've seen one area you've seen them all. I didn't get a sense of much handmade goods or any unique boutiques. The brands were unfamiliar to me as I'm not used to the K-Brands, but it was fun to be around this area. I did get a hipster feel to here. Like many areas they had big department stores and it felt the crowd here was a bit younger, maybe late teens to young 20's. It's worth a stop and visit. Bring some cash, these districts aren't cheap.Also it seems this would be a good place for night life, but I was here during the afternoon. Smoking a cigar in this area, you stand out."
14,5.0,"My first time to visit Seoul and choose airbnb around Hongdae area, near to Hongik University. And it's absolutely amazinnggggggggg...

18,5.0,"Great vibe and lots of energy on these streets.  Great expressions and performances.  From what we experienced on a weekday in November, this place was quiet and like a ghost town at 9am.  Things started perking up around noon, then came alive in the afternoon.  We didn't stay for the evening, but imagine it must have been a big block party all over."
19,4.0,"It was just too packed. Lots of great restaurants there and cheap place for great clothing. Also I have to love the ""butter"" shop inside the Hongik Station (near exit 6 if you are interested)."

25,5.0,Nice shopping street with cheap goods and food compare to Myeongdong. The street is not so crowded as in Myeongdong and if you intend to get some clothing here's the place.

30,3.0,"Hongik or known as Hongdae is a very happening place in the evening where wannabe korean artists will have performance on the streets everywhere. There are plenty of restaurants to chose from as well. But shopping is more expensive here vs Ewha University. So if your main objective is to shop for clothings, go to Ewha instead & skip here."
31,4.0,"This street full of chicken and korean bbq with beer. Good place for dinner. In fact i have been staying here for 8 days and having 3 day dinner here trying different type of food.

33,5.0,"This Hongik University Street is my personal best experience of my Seoul trip, at first I am not sure why my wife brought me here, it just a street in my mind, but after we arrive at the metro and walk into this street, the atmosphere is superb, mind blowing and you feel  younger for sure...I hope I had come here 10 years younger when I can mingle more with students, but is still great to feel how lively and energetic they areThe performers mostly are singer and dancer, and they do really know what they are doing, all is K-Pop Star like performance.I am not sure this is daily night thing or only weekend because we are there during the Chuseok holiday. The street is full of performers and visitor... and little up there is the shopping street I guess,... is too full of people... so lively...you got to visit here to feel what I am trying to express....Highly recommended for all Seoul visitor to try it out !"

38,5.0,I suggest if you are staying in the area to take a walk in the morning to get a feel for the layout and what stores are there.  In the evening it gets very crowded and harder to navigate. We enjoyed the buskers.
39,5.0,"Kinda regretting that we didn't spend longer time here. Make sure to visit during weekend, especially Saturday as you can spot many busking activities. The places to eat, shops and strolls are in abundance. The place is near a campus (Hongik University, hence, the name) so expect lively and vibrant place where you can encounter young people everywhere."

43,5.0,"For first timers in Korea, I would suggest staying in this time because you get a feel of the Korean culture, their lifestyle, their food and their fashion. The place is lined with restaurants, shops selling clothes plus a number of specialty stores such as Line shop, Kakao shop to name a few. The place is also near proximity to places such as Gyeongui book street with speciality book cafes or to Yeon Nam dong. All within walking distance."
44,5.0,"The average age of this street must be around 20 or less. The streets are full of shops selling everything youths go for / hang out - fashion, accessories, cafes, restaurants, etc.  There are also spots where some of the youths are performing anything from singing to dancing to juggling - you can find these where the crowds are gathering."
45,3.0,"It comprises of a few streets near the entrance of the university and you can find a variety of food, beverages and clothing for sale.  I was expecting fashionable street wear to be available since this is a spot for youngsters but the clothes sold are generally too ordinary."
46,4.0,"This whole area contains some of the best things in Seoul. Tons of dog, cat, rabbit, and even MEERCAT cafes. At night there is always different street performers (dancers, singers, etc) gathered throughout the streets. I’ve spent days here just exploring and still haven’t seen even close to everything. Monster Pizza and Gusto Taco are the best places to eat here. Great for vegetarians and everyone.Also has a bumping clubbing scene. Would DEFINITELY recommend a night of Korean clubbing, followed by some night karaoke.Great for all ages."

We watched the street amateur performers, left and right from afternoon til night.Lots of shops around, tattoo and piercing shops, coffee shops, restaurants, ice cream shops, foodstalls, convenience store and english speaking tourist information.

50,4.0,"With all the shops you can name and the malls locating around this area, this is a good place to shop with metro station just nearby. Stuff are a little more expensive than the one you can get at namdaemun and myeongdong though."
51,5.0,Went to this area to go to the trick eye museum and was pleasantly surprised with the little shops along the way. Could not resist shopping. This is a place to visit.
52,4.0,"The young people of the country makes the street very lively and it showcases the current Korean pop culture. There were students performing live, singing K-Pop songs and groups of female students dancing to the tune of K-Pop songs. Watching them perform are other students and passer-by; cheering and dancing along. I think the street was filled with more performers as the night get darker.Besides performances, the street is home to many stalls and shops selling cheap accessories. Further up the street, there were also stalls selling snacks and food.We also find that the street had some cheap food, most probably due to its close proximity to the student population.Recommend a visit to experience the pop culture through the students' lifestyle."
53,5.0,"From all the shopping to the restaurants to the novelty coffee houses (cats and bunnies and dogs, oh my!) this entire area has something for everyone. Like video games? They've got then.

55,5.0,"A place where young people would like to visit .  When you leave from exit no 9 of Hongik University mtr, especially in weekend, there are a lot of hawkers selling goods and food.  You can see a lot of young boys and girls dancing in the street like K-pop groups.  Sometimes there are arts students selling their paintings and handmade accessories.  This is a great place you must visit if you want to know more about Korean culture."
56,5.0,"A lot of people coming here/ Especially at Friday's night and I know why! Cheap and tasty street food, many talented guys and girls singning or dancing - that  a perfext combination for the evening :) Also, many small shops open very late. I love to stay at this area next time"
57,5.0,"Experience it best at night. Buy your beer from a take-out counter and sit around the mini park with performing artists for free. Watch dog owners walk their dogs around. Or eat at one of the restaurants overlooking the park. Good food, friendly waiters. Bars, coffee shops, convenient stores are available."
58,5.0,"Just like Myeong-Dong but minus the crowd and wide array of shops. I wasn't able to get free masks here unlike in Myeong-Dong but the place is so nice! It's usually full of students and young couples. Here you can find LOHB or Love, Health and Beauty, a store you can't find in Myeong-Dong."
59,4.0,"Full of teenagers performing K-POP dance along the streets.  A very happening place with fashion, restaurants & cafes!"
60,5.0,"We chose to stay in the Hongik area and so the streets around us became the go to place for meals, drinks, supermarkets etc. Also, close to main MTR lines"
61,5.0,"This street leads you to all kinds of alleyways that offer a variety of clothes, shoes, accessories and cafes. Hongik seems to be an oasis for foodies who love hunting for that sumptuous fare or simply relaxing over coffee and cake. At night, the streets throb with Kpop Star wannabes who belt out songs with gusto. I personally prefer it to Myeongdong as it has a good blend of dining options, street snacks and clothes n accessories stores. There is a huge Bershka there. The biggest i have ever seen."
62,4.0,"Went on Sunday night. Snow flakes falling. Young people dancing. Not just dancing, but Kpop style the kind that makes your body subconsciously while watching. It is that addictive and these people ARE good. You see (sometimes) the coach by the side or by the corner teaching the steps and polishing their moves. A must see ! Also loads of restaurants here. Very crowded on weekends."
63,4.0,"A trendy part of Seoul, which I would describe as ""Myeongdong lite"" because you can't really differentiate the merchandise or the food being sold there and those at Myeongdong.  The area is a lot smaller though and not as insanely crowded, hence the ""lite"" description.  One thing is unique though, and thats live performances.  A lot of new young talent showcasing themselves to the public."
64,4.0,"This is a lively neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants frequented by millenials. Cheap, fashionable clothing are sold around the area and at nighttime, the bars light up and the young adults become wild."
65,2.0,It's a very lively place. Great for young adult and teenagers. Too crowded. Not for family with young kids.
66,5.0,"You can always feel the energy and liveliness of this area. Bustling with students and young people, the area has catered to its mostly younger clientele with cheap eats yet delicious restaurants and stores selling items with prices aimed at students. You won't find items cheaper anywhere else: clothes, accessories, etc.It's like a Myeongdong for the youth who don't want to be ripped off.The area has also many cafes and a lot of teenage girls gathering around to see guys performing live.Everyone is bound to have a great time here!"
67,5.0,Very international environment with places like Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory and Taco Bell. There are even more exotic cafes where you can pay to play with exotic animals like meercats or racoons. Very interesting experience. I especially liked the Jjimdak chicken and cheese dish across the street from Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.
68,5.0,Lots of street performances. Come there to feel young and hip! No lack of food and great place to be in.
69,2.0,More restaurants than shops and they are mainly for ladies. Quite disappointed that I couldn’t get anything for my son.
70,5.0,"Surrounded by the universities within the area, this place is filled with great eateries. There are many interesting cafes along the way. If you are lucky, are able to see the young generation showcasing their talents on the street."
71,3.0,"This is the place for younger generation. You can find dancing teams and singers performing beside the street & they are students. You will find many shops selling cheaper goods for the fact most people in this area are younger. Surely some shops are still in good quality & suitable for hangout for a while. In comparison with other area in Seoul, the varieties are not here.這是個屬於年輕人的地區，可以看到跳舞團體或是獨唱者在路邊表演，多數為學生，大多的店賣比較便宜的東西，因為顧客多為學生或是年輕人，還是有些店家的東西還不錯可以來逛一逛；跟其他首爾區域比起來還是單薄了點。"
72,5.0,"There were lots of shops for cosmetics, apparels and food as expected when one is in Seoul but there were more to it here! Come during night time and you get to watch youngsters dancing, singing kpop songs and many other performances. Some of the must try foods are the barbecue meats on hot stones(where the smoke doesn't leave a smell on you when u leave the place and the meats don't get burnt! The shop is just opposite CU mart), fried chicken with beers, chicken galibi with cheese and many cafeterias which operate till late nights!"
73,4.0,"I went in the winter holidays, so unfortunately I did not see much busking or sorts (I am certain there are lots of singers and dancers busking on the streets when the weather becomes hotter though) but the atmosphere was still very vibrant nonetheless and busy and there were so many stores I did not know which to go to first! Here there are bigger stores like Nike, Adidas, Mcm and also smaller clothing stores, cosmetic stores and such; perfect for shoppers! As well as this, there were many clubs and I believe there are many festivals here. There was a lot of good food here and I would really suggest coming here for at least 2 hours if you have the time. Although not the sole purpose, there is also a great likelihood of meeting Korean celebrities here which is just an extra bonus for coming here. I would definitely suggest coming to this busy, young, exciting place."
74,4.0,"I went during summer holiday to this area. There were many street artist doing dancing, singing, and playing music. They were plenty of restaurant and of course clothing stores for ladies :)I also a very nice bingsoo in this area, for unfortunately I forgot the restaurant name :( because the store all written in Hangul.."

79,5.0,"I have a 16 and a 12 years old with me during this trip. They had fun walking around the area and shopping around. You won't be disappointed. Oh, try the Isaac sandwiches shop, unlike the other Isaac shops on the street, this one is like a coffee shop that you can sit down and enjoy the sandwiches."
80,4.0,"We have visited the main road at Hongik University Station every visit but never taken a step back to see the streets around the university itself. We were blown away by the difference one street made. The stalls, shops, restaurants and atmosphere were just so different and the student base really captured a lively presence. We found an amazing all-you-can eat Korean BBQ restaurant and my daughter found some well priced trendy clothes to take home. Watermelon juice in a small watermelon.  Visited 2 afternoons in a row to see it all."
81,4.0,Hipster and lively place For street shopping and people watching.Many local uni students around and cute cafe to sit and take a rest

88,5.0,"Came here several times during the daytime to hunt for foods, clothes and local goods as souvenir. Heard from my friend that there will be street performer showing their awesome talent on weekends night and I want to check that out (I never watch any street performance in Seoul before). To my surprise, there was a lot of street performer teams scattered throughout the street, and most of them start do their things (dancing/singing/magic show etc) as early as 5pm. I'm interested in watching the dance group do their synchronize dance move, some have group names some don't. There is one dance group so memorable and amazing, they made me stuck there watching them until 10pm!!. For me, this was the first time I feel the charm of Hongdae street (even though I went there many times), it was so lively and happening during night especially on weekend."
89,5.0,"Prefer this street to Myeongdong. You would still get the skin care outlets here but less crowded and harassment from the sales staff. Clothes, socks and caps are cheap. Good selection of restaurants."
90,4.0,"Lots of shops and.stalls, but not fancy stuff,  mainly food and accessories. Its better late afternoon to evening when it gets more lively with Uni artists performing in the streets.Evenings there are discos and pretty girls walking everywhere."

94,5.0,"The streets of Hongik University had so much fun food, cute stores and affordable things to do for the college students of Hongik. You'll be in for a huge surprise if you are from the United States, cause you don't have this kind of atmosphere at any of the universities in America. We ate too much, but a little bit of everything we saw. It's truly a fun place to hang out with adult children. We tried the dollar karaoke booths, you pay 1,000won for four songs. There are many places to grab a drink, eat, places to buy souvenirs. Totally worth spending a day here with friends or family. If you plan to visit Seoul, this is one place you want to visit!"
95,4.0,Enjoyed shopping and settling my dinner in Hongik University Street.It is definitely worth going and accessible by subway and AREX trains!
96,5.0,"If you are looking to soak up the crowds and experience something relaxing and unique in Korea, Hongdae area of Seoul is the place to be. There are hundreds of restaurants, coffee shops, street food stands, bars, and shops in this area to explore. One street is almost exclusively blocks and blocks of restaurants and bars. Whenever you are walking around in the restaurant/bar area expect the unexpected. You never know when you will see a crowd of people in the street being entertained by random buskers, dancers, artist, magicians and comedians. You may have an experience like I did, where I say a large group of professional photographers setting up for an event. I hung around for about 20 minutes before a brand new k-pop girl group showed up to perform their debut album for the crowd of 75-125 people that happened upon it.I have seen several k-dramas and Korean movies being filmed here, as well as walking up on random Korean celebrities enjoying a day out in public. This area is constantly changing and evolving and you never know what you'll find. Also, not to be missed, is the Trick Eye and Love museums located here. Bring enough money to spend on random things that you never expected to find. The inexpensive unique  trinkets, souvenirs, shirts with hilarious Engrish, and delicious street food (in addition to all the great restaurants) will have you happily spending more than you expected.Awsome to walk around in the winter (bundle up) but even more exciting in the summer, just be prepared for shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, up and down the streets in some areas in the summer.This can be an all day excursion. I would plan to be here before lunch to fill up on all the delicious street food you will want to experience then stay till sundown and enjoy the nightlife and a delicious restaurant. Dont be afraid to venture off the main road, into the alleys for an even richer experience, including smaller unique boutiques, coffee shops and some wonderful artwork/graffiti.Tip: Bring extra battery power for your camera, you'll need it."
97,3.0,"happening but happy trip, stayed at a convenient place in Myeongdong, can always return to hotel to rest abit and continue shopping and eating again.experienced snowing for the first time after few trips, nice shopping except for unpleasant touting sales outside cosmetic shops. Language barrier with the authentic locals, can be hosted with unfriendly services at cafes or restaurants, but just be courteous and speak simple  English to get by.  If you lost your way, find a young couple to help you, show them the places of interest, they generally can speak English and will give their utmost help. Will be back again for shopping, eating and drinking Hite with nice chicken wings."

In the middle of the street area there were performers lined up group after group and they were all singing and dancing to modern k-pop style music. The kids enjoyed that.

101,5.0,"Here You will find cute little shops lining the street of hongdae (mainly selling clothes and shoes). As from the name you know thats its located by the Hongik university so the majority of the people you see here are university students. The clothes and shoes you find here are mostly for younger people (university students age or younger adults). The prices tend to be a little bit cheaper than other Seoul shopping streets, maybe so that the university students can afford them. They also have a lot of street side stalls selling korean traditional street food and clothes, but not as much as in myeong-dong. If you want to try eating spicy ttebokki (rice cakes in red hot sauce) or sundae (blood sausages) and korean style tempura in a plastic covered road stalls tend by an ahjumma (older ladies, usually a grandma age) like what you usually see in K-drama then you can try them out there as i saw many stalls around the area. Just pick a bigger and cleaner stall as i saw some of them are gaudy looking. It is a standing eating stall and you just tell the ahjumma what you want then she will serve it to you and pay only after you finish eating. For people with younger kids please dont forget to bring a stroller with you because streets in hongdae tend to go up and down hill. Great outdoor shopping avenue, just wear thicker clothes as the temperature might get much colder at night during winter."

106,4.0,We stayed in Hongdae and only 5 mins away from the popular streetwalk. The street (without performers) are busy with crowds even on weekday. Nice reasonable priced clothes and it's good enough for window shopping. The street came alive on Friday night with youngsters performing their arts. Beware of incoming cars thought the street is not closed to traffic. Wonderful place!
107,5.0,"Hongik University Street is different from the Myeongdong and is definitely a must-see place. There were a lot of students at night and a lot of stalls as well. However, there were lesser cosmetics shops compared to Myeongdong as this is a university street rather than a shopping street."

110,4.0,"Hongdae is a place that can be seen both during the day and at night. For us, we decided to visit on a Sunday night, when there are more crowds compared to the weekdays.Hongdae is the place when you can get to see street markets and performances by young people, especially students as it is located near the university areas. In that sense, it reminded us a little of Taiwan's Ximending area or Singapore's Bugis Street, although I would say it really isn't an exact comparison.There are plenty of places to eat and shop, with street food all around the place and especially the noraebang(s) (노래방) and the DVD bangs, which are places for people to sing karaoke and watch DVDs in a private space respectively. This is something that is rather unique in South Korea and should be seen first hand yourself to understand the South Korean culture better. There are also the occasional PC bang, which is basically a LAN gaming café, but these are getting a little more difficult to be seen nowadays though.At night though, things change a little. Other places in Seoul after 10pm or 11pm might be winding down for the night, but not Hongdae. At 11pm, the nightclubs and bars start to open and this is when you will see many young clubbers queueing up to get into these places for a night of clubbing and fun, with many opening until 2am or 3am. This is where sometimes people do get rather drunk until sometimes, they need help from their friends to prevent stumbling onto the pavement when walking, so do watch your step.Unfortunately, on the day we went Hongdae itself, it was raining on and off, and the next day was a public holiday, so it took us a long time to get a taxi back to our hotel. Still, we do wish to come back to Hongdae again though, probably during daytime, to see the difference. Overall, a place that should not be missed for a first time traveler."

We love the restaurant where we had lunch, but are unsure of the name. It was on the street next to the graffiti art and had an industrial/workshop (nuts and bolts) motif. The food and the wait staff were both great."

Most of the Korean Skincare brands that could be find in Myeongdong could be found here as well!

Custom is to eat before you drink, and they love their fried chicken in Korea! Shopping is also great in this area, and the stores are open late! Due to my military curfew I had to leave at midnight, but the stores were still open at that time!"

219,5.0,"Hongdae is like a vibrant indie place with lots of good food and cheap shopping to be done. Graffiti and street art can be seen here. A lot of good creative vibe here. Love this place. We went cafe hopping in this area. There's the hello kitty cafe, Toms Cat ( A cafe with 33 cats in it), theres also a sheep cafe, a dog cafe and we went to this cafe with really nice gelato and lemonade. You can get $10 clothes and $20 - $30 shoes although i'd really recommend for some cheap shopping around eehwa University. This place is also famous for clubbing and partying at night, the street comes alive at night and there are lots of bbq (Samgyupsal) shops around this area. Trickeye museum is also here."

Was using hand signals to order when a friendly korean girl offered to translate for us.  There were performers singing on sidewalk and they were pretty good. If you have a free afternoon, I would recommend this place, if just for the atmosphere."

226,4.0,We went on a Saturday afternoon unfortunately it was raining still there is a good crowd mostly young people (may be University students) The place is very vibrant and colourful. You do find lots of adhoc street performance. Most of the places you get wifi free if you are on smart phone or tablet you spend some time. You do find some eating places also. Comparing with other areas like Myeong dong here things are little cheap.

I was worried when I chose to stay at a guesthose located at Hongdae cause it's not that popular when compared to Myeongdong & Dongdaemun. But my worries were just too much.
