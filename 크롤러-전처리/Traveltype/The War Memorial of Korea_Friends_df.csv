0,4.0,"A good visit, the exhibits were well put together and easy to understand. Lots to see, lovely entrance and well kept grounds. We spent a couple hours here as part of a day trip. There is a small gift shop and cafeteria."
1,5.0,"Even if you don’t like war memorials, this museum is definitely worth visiting. I actually enjoy these museums because it is not idolizing the wars, but reminding us the importance of peace and it’s true cost paid by those who lived and died.I have been rather disappointed by many of the museums in Korea. I expect places to be large, but way too many of them have been tiny. This place is grand and has many interesting displays that make it worth your time. It is free, so that assumption is hard to make. The place is clean, easy to navigate and fun for the whole family. Remember that the wars commemorated here are related to Korea but many nations are represented because the world cared about defeating evil at one point. Wasn’t all about profits and greed.Whole visit should be about 2 hours if you are a casual goer."
2,5.0,"Large museum with engaging presentation of historical facts. Outdoor area has real military equipment, including planes, tanks and boats, some of which can be climbed on or in. Indoor area has multiple video displays or 4d movies, as well as standard plaques.A couple floors dedicated to the Korean war, while another floor has ancient war history, including a very cool scale replica of a turtle ship.Very tasteful and honoring memorial to fallen soldiers and overall great presentation of historical facts on the Korean war. I plan to come to this museum whenever I visit Seoul."
3,5.0,"We are Turks and we are proud of heroes that live with us forever. All the nations that are included in the war are seen with their names, flags and clothes."
4,1.0,"Very interesting museum but the wonderful visit were wasted by some racist worker. As we were waiting for the line for an animated room (incheon landing 4D simulation) with a 15 people capacity and 30minutes long waiting line between the sessions, the staff member who were in charge of the line had the audacity to put first 4 korean girls who came after us. Indeed, she went to talk to them then one of them started to give us some weird glances. Then when it was the time to enter the room the 4 Korean girls quickly  took the 3D glaces and run in the entry. We were 3 and she came to us at the end to give us the glaces but only 2 remained...when we told her that we were there before and we were going in together she went to give the glaces to the people behind us. We tried to complain but she brushed us off and completely ignored us. Even though we stayed very polite we were really disappointed by this unfair experience."
5,5.0,War memorial is perfect place to closely learn about history and sacrifice of Korean people It also shows countries who stood by and against Korea Very nice building and perfect place must visit
6,5.0,"This museum was included in our Seoul City Tour company's tour of N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial.  This museum is a Traveler's Choice Award museum and it does deserve this.  This is a huge modern multi media museum that was free to go into.I concentrated on the section that covered the Korean War.  I did not understand this war before going to this museum but I do understand why it happened now.  I wish that I would have had more time to spend on this museum because they had other indoor displays and lots of outdoor sights as well.  1 1/2 hours was just not enough time."
7,5.0,This is a must-see if you are visiting Seoul. Especially if you are interested in military history. It takes you through all the military conflicts involving South Korea.
8,5.0,"We were here a half day and did not nearly see it all.  We started with the outside area first coming upon the Clock Tower of Peace and then the Statue of Brothers.  From there we visited all the outdoor sights and particularly the Open-air Exhibition Area.  On a warm May day I really did not want to leave but there are very few places to sit and take a break and with standing, reading, and observing a nice short bench break would have been welcomed.  The first floor held a very interesting up to date exhibit (which may have been a special exhibit) about recent relations with North Korea.  Admission is free.  Be sure to grab a  free brochure as it will help you plan your time at the museum."
9,5.0,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea today. It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore. The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics. From prehistoric weapons, displays from different eras in Korean history to the high-tech displays to Admiral sun-shin's turtle ship- it is all here impressively displayed. Admission is by donation. The only suggestion that I would make is to have the address written in hangul on website (for the cab drivers). Be prepared to spend hours here. It's worth it."
10,5.0,"There is a Memorial Hall for those who have passed from service in various Wars of Korea. Also there are military vehicles such as planes, ship, tanks and others where you can take photos or get a closer look. Within there are exhibits for the various wars Korea was involved in from early history to current. On Fridays, at 2 p.m. there is an exhibition of the various military branches in the front of the museum. This is where you experience the all female Color Guard, traditional martial arts, the various anthems of the military branches, and many other performances by the various military branches. Make sure to sit outside by one as they start to practice so you get a good spot to sit on the steps. Also, there is no charge for this Museum."
11,5.0,A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom. War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the sone of worst decades in world history. To see war bring together the most unlikely and war torn countries together to fight for the freedom of others and rebuilding of others. It’s an amazing.
12,4.0,"We came after lunch to the War Memorial. It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North Korean-Russian-Chinese forces to armistice. There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus on and what to pass on. There is lots of English interpretation, unlike some other museums in Korea, and many beautiful sculptural tributes to the many soldiers who gave their lives. Korea lost just over 170,000 soldiers and God knows how many civilians. Just over 10,000 Americans died. There is no entry fee, there are a number of good video programs and there is a coffee shop if you suffer from museum eyes after a while. For Americans especially I think this is a good way to understand something of the very special bond that exists between Koreans and Americans. One thing it could do better is to illustrate the cultural rifts between North and South that existed for centuries before the conflict. This dividing line is not just a creature of the Cold War. Coming during the week would be a good idea. We were there on a Thursday afternoon and found plentiful parking. I'd certainly go again."
13,5.0,Fantastic museum. Well worth a visit. You need a few hours to have a good look. Very easy to get to on the subway.
14,5.0,Spent a few hours at the large free memorial.   Amazing collection of items from the war.  The largest I have ever seen at a single museum on the war.  Provides detailed history of the conflict between North and South Korea.
15,1.0,"Well....it definitely IS a WAR museum. I found it simply obnoxious. We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game. It was a 4d movie! Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye.... ok.... not my idea of a „war museum“(that is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war)..... but when these soldiers started to fire at their own -but north- korean people I was just simply shocked. I have never ever seen such an impiety before. It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the „show“. But they wouldn’t dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldn’t want to clap. The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war, it even more glorifies it. It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum. It’s more like US Propaganda."
16,4.0,"It was the first time I saw war weapons, aircraft, war ship and tankers used during the war. Very informative visit."
17,5.0,"I visited this museum and spent good 5+ hours touring around. They have exhaustive materials on war history, literally from the very beginning. The Korean war materials were very sobering as well as educational. Make sure the check outside yard for their extensive collection of war equipments!"
18,5.0,"I visited with my friend from Australia. He didn't have any knowledge of South Korea. I thought this place just explain about weapon or flight of war something ... I have been there, but I didn't remember well. And I knew I was totally wrong. we had 5 hour there but it was not enough time for see there. Long Long time ago Korea had war and war again a lot too many time. so if you know the war of Korea you will know about Korea history, nationality, geography ... it was my best part of trip. don't think too much Just go there and see about Korea. Never disappointed you !"
19,5.0,"I’ve been to many number of war memorials and military museums: this takes the cake. Huge collection of both Western and Soviet vehicles (tanks and aircraft) outside.The inside of the war memorial is touching, and appropriately conveys the loss of life in the Korean War.It is also one of the few governments attractions that is free. A must."
20,5.0,We stumbled upon this on a rainy afternoon when looking for something to do in the area. We arrived late afternoon to find it filled with School children but they soon left. The outside was filled with war vechicles such as tanks and planes and you can easily wander between them getting very close. The inside was spacious and set out nicely. There are lots of war rooms telling the complete history of Korea and war history. Everything is written in English as well and all the films have an English option. We couldn’t believe the musuem was free! Thoroughly impressed and educated now.
21,5.0,"Beautiful grounds and building. Outdoor full of planes, tanks etc. For children and adults to climb. The museum is one of the best I’ve been to. Must see !"
22,5.0,"While in Seoul, South Korea, I had the opportunity, and yes I consider it to have been a real honor, to visit three of the Korean War memorials here in the greater Seoul Metro Area. My visits provided me with some valuable insights into the Korean War that began on June the 25th 1950.Two of the memorials that I visited were the UN FORCES FIRST BATTLE MEMORIAL located in Osan and THE MEMORIAL HALL OF THE INCHEON LANDING OPERATION located in Incheon.The War Memorial of Korea here in Seoul is easily, far-and-away, the largest of the three Korean War memorials that I have seen and visited while in Seoul. It is absolutely enormous. To do it justice, a visit would take a full day and even that would be a push. I feel that I saw perhaps 40% of it and that was accomplished during two separate visits that were several days apart.Which leads me to this comment : IF you are handicapped and have difficulty walking, you may want to take the size of The War Memorial of Korea into consideration. IF you have a wheel chair you will be in great shape. IF not, there are ample places to sit and to rest. There can be no question that IF you have an interest in the Korean War, this is an absolute must-see attraction."
23,4.0,It will take you 4-5 hrs to tour this big museum and see the rich history of Korean War.  Restaurants and other food establishments are few meters away.  Bring small snacks just in case.
24,4.0,"I went the day after Chinese New Year, but it was closed, so I was able to go for a couple hours before my flight home.  The museum was very informative and provided a great insight into the history and how the war started and the role of the UN forces.  Upon entering, I was greeted by what turned out to be an English speaking guide.  He was very informative, but I had to part and rush through the remaining exhibits to catch my flight out.  Otherwise, I'd probably spend another couple hours there.  Highly recommended."
25,5.0,"Probably best to visit this museum a few times to give all the exhibitions the time they deserve. If you are into Korean history, be sure to visit this place. Also good to get background information about historical sites you might visit. (Like Hwaseong fortess in Suwon)The Korean War Memorial is beautiful."
26,5.0,Take time to view all of the static displays outside and the amazing displays inside.  We spent three hours here and could have stayed the entire day.  This museum is a must visit for everyone coming to Seoul.  It is very well done.
27,4.0,"Very good museum to visit, mainly focusing on Korean War history. It is located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Entry is free. The war memorial building has many exhibition rooms and an outdoor exhibition centre. There are nice displays of planes, tanks, and other military equipment. You will find a detailed explanation of Korean War history throughout the museum."
28,5.0,At first I taught that it just like a normally boring museum.  But its not...its a great museum to learn about the war of Korea. The outdoor itself so attractive with so many planes and ships. Indoor also good place to learn more about what occurred during the war in Korea.  Not regret visited the War Memorial of Korea.  Everyone enjoy the place.
29,5.0,"The grounds of of the museum are huge and beautiful. You can see Seoul Tower from the outside exhibits. Very educational in an interesting and intriguing way. All information available in english. fascinating exhibits. Best to go on a day that it isn't raining so you can enjoy the exhibits that are outside. Suggested time spent here, 2+ hours"
30,3.0,Good alternative in addition to other tourist spots in Seoul. There is an outdoor area which holds memorial monuments and also display various tanks and planes that were used in the war. Great place to learn about the history of the Korean War. Be sure to visit the 4D simulator to get a glimpse of what it was like during the war.
31,5.0,I really enjoyed the War Memorial because it covered the various wars and not just the Korean War. It included all wars where Koreas were involved and it has been done very respectfully. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Seoul. The outdoor exhibition on all the planes is also amazing.
32,4.0,"Interesting museum with a lot of information and military equipment used in real life inside. Museum has both closed and open spaces. Open space is an exhibition of many military planes, boats, weapons and vehicles. It is better to visit on such a day that weather conditions allow to stay outside long time."
33,5.0,"If you only had enough time to do one thing in Seoul, this should be it. We found this place unexpectedly moving. It does have the most massive display of military equipment I have ever seen in one place, but the overarching theme is one of gratitude to every country that helped South Korea in this war, and also that war is a horrible thing. A lot of displays focused on the impact this war had on families of all countries. The museum covers military artifacts and uniforms all the way back to prehistoric times, which was a bonus. This museum is very well thought out and again, pays great respect to all countries involved in the war. There are hands on displays for kids (mini castle to walk around in, many military vehicles can be boarded). Several films are available on demand to be seen in several languages, including English. Very impressive museum, and I don't give that compliment lightly. Don't miss. Admission free. Cafeteria and gift shop."
34,4.0,"Lots of old aircrafts, tanks and a war ship.  They did great on remembering the heroes who fought in this war.  The plan was to stay an hour but took us 2 hours. Time flies when one is enjoying.  The best museum I’ve been to yet."
35,5.0,"We recommend this museum to all of our friends who visit us in Korea.  It has so much information about the Korean war as well as a huge range of military tanks, planes and even a boat outside.  It's great for the whole family, although the kids did get a bit bored inside.  The building is vast and so beautifully set out, that even just walking around it is interesting."
36,5.0,Especially enjoyed the section regarding the Korean War. I wish I had done a little research about other Wars as I didn't realize Korea has been involved with so many wars in the past.
37,5.0,I didn't look at pics or read reviews prior to going and was pleasantly surprised by the detailed history lesson that was presented. I spent many hours here. Thoroughly enjoyable if not sobering.
38,5.0,"This is a huge museum that goes through Korea’s military history from the Middle Ages until modern times. Outside there is a large area to check out airplanes, tanks, helicopters, and even a ship."
39,4.0,"Don’t need too long there but try get an english speaking guide. They will take a group through the museum. They have some really cool things from the war scattered around the museum. Outside they have Korean and US planes. Some real, some replicas (I believe). Don’t need too much longer than 3-4 hours so it’s a good half day"
40,4.0,"Stumbled across this as it was right next to our hostel so took a wander through.Lovely statues and imagery, good explanations in English, really made you think. I think my dad would have loved the tanks/planes etc behind - anyone who's into that kind of thing (as well as Korean history ofc) should definitely take a look!"
41,5.0,This place is also know as War memorial and museum as it contains all the relics and records related to the many wars fought in the country. It’s really nice that they have the flags placed around the entrance of all the various countries that helped them during the war.
42,5.0,"I'm a history buff, but to visit the War Memorial of Korea was a really cool experience. I do recommend that you go early, as soon as they open. They have lots of field trips for kids here and it gets busy and very loud. Very informative of the Korean and Allied war efforts on the Korean Peninsula during that time and beyond. Again, it's a must visit if you have a few hours to spare. But leave yourself plenty of time to check out all 3 floors of the museum to include all of the aircraft and war machinery outside."
43,5.0,This war museum in Seoul South Korea was such a great experience!I went there in December 2015 on a business trip & I was amazed at how well put together the exhibits are. A few of them are audio-visual & interactive. They do a great job at educating foreigners like myself & locals alike of this trying time in South Korean history.Definitely recommended to go there at least once
44,5.0,"I’ve been to many war museums and I have to say that the War Memorial of Korea is the best. Lots of statues/monuments and army vehicles outside including a very interesting area for Korean children about surviving a chemical, nuclear or biological attack.  It was under the monument with the statues around it and I don’t think we were supposed to go in as the staff looked slightly shocked to see us.  Of course it has its fair share of propaganda but it charts the history of Korea from the beginning to present day. There’s not much on the current North/South Korea issues. Most of the displays have an English translation and the videos could be accessed in English by pressing a button. No audio guides and the QR information code didn’t seem to be working. I went expecting to spend about an hour but ended up staying for 3.5 hours!!"
45,4.0,This is a good place to find out more about the korean war and the history behind it. It was a nice place to be for a few hrs to hide away from the hot sun.
46,3.0,"I didnt find this place very interesting, compared to other similar places that I have visited in the past."
47,4.0,Went with friend to this museum. The museum is so big and informative. I love how they keep tracking al their heroes.
48,5.0,"This museum is beautifully presented and a guided tour is a must. The guide will give a detailed description of South Koreas invasion by the north and its visually stunning and thought provoking. There is a large area outside full of tanks, airplanes, a ship , helicopters and missiles that you can get up close to. No entry fee and a very detailed FREE book awaits you as you arrive. Incredibly impressed with this museum and it has lots of areas centred around youngsters as well. Great for all ages"
49,4.0,"I visit this place only exploring the outside of building. It is a very nice park and we can see a lot of war vehicle such as war ship, war airplane, etc."
50,5.0,"I am not a huge history buff, but this memorial/museum is extremely well done and informative.  The memorial statues are well done, the old tanks and planes interesting to see, and the museum gave me a concise overview of the Korean war and history.  You can only shop and eat so much in Seoul.  Take an hour or two and stop by this memorial, you won't regret it!  Bonus, it's free!"
51,5.0,"I knew very little about the history of Korea before visiting this museum. But after a few hours walking around the exhibits, I left with a good understanding the how the country got to where it is and where it fits in historically with it's neighbors (Japan, China, Russia, etc.). It not only explains the Korean War but also several dynasties of rule, war and development. Definitely worth a few hour visit."
52,5.0,"Great deal of work and details have been put into creating/organizing and managing the place. Awesome pieces and collection in the exibition, the outdoor collection if old aircrfats, tanks and flank guns and other military equipments from the korean war is a delight to see.And its Free Free Free"
53,5.0,"I got myself to learn tons of new things here about history of Korea , so tremendous and sacred site"
54,5.0,"One of the initial rooms resembles a starry night, with a pensive in the middle. I found it moving, and it set the tone for the rest of the visit. Of course, the museum captures the spirit of the combined actions taken to keep the Republic Of Korea free in the face of tyrants during the 1950's, but the older wars are equally well represented."
55,5.0,"We almost skipped this, thinking we had all been to DC and seen a million war memorials. This one is soooo different! I have never been to a more hopeful and humble memorial, giving credit and thanks to all the other nations that came to their aid. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but this memorial has an affect on us unlike any other I’ve been to."
56,5.0,"Truly an awesome place to learn about the history of Korean War and showing honour to the people who had defended and sacrifice for their country. There are also exhibits of planes, tanks, warship and others at open area of the building. Best part of all, it's free."
57,3.0,"Any war memorial or museum should bring home to people the horror and terror of war. This one tries to do that by having wax figures posed in various dioramas.This does it a disservice - it becomes entertainment, on a level with war movies where we know the heroes will come out alive. There is enough archival materials to present instead of these dolls."
58,5.0,"A very poignant and somber experience will hit anyone who enters this building as Korea tell their story about the wars that have inflicted the country including Japanese colonisation and the Korea War which inevitably led to the spitting of the country into North and South Korea and the country's that came to South Korea's side in their time of need. The museum is very big and will probably take most people 3 to 4 hours to get round entirely but there are some not worthy exhibitions including the donated articles and relics and the Korea War segment and all the vehicles outside. The museum is free , there is free Wi-Fi and there is a cafe for anyone who can't stand a 3 hour museum visit."
59,5.0,I visited this place because it had high reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not expecting too much of it but it was a great experience. I was just disappointed by the national Museum and this memorial saved my day. Totally worth the visit and plan 3 hours at least to go through it.
60,5.0,"The outer grounds of the War Memorial of Korea are impressive enough, with several larger-than-life statues/monuments, as well as an impressive collection of interactive planes, ships, and ground vehicles from the Korean War and beyond.  The outer walls of the museum are lined with the names of all who died during the conflict, and the the interior of the Memorial is actually three floors stacked with an enormous amount of exhibits and information on not only the Korean War, but also the many conflicts Korea has been involved in in its long history."
61,5.0,"Definitely a must-visit for history buffs and people interested in diplomacy, intl relations and politics. Makes you appreciate international cooperation in resolving conflicts, and restoring peace. Come here also to honor the soldiers who died or went missing during the Korean war. The facility has stone columns with all the soldiers’ names written on them. Not just Koreans but from all other countries who helped through the UN. The museum inside is foreigner- friendly - with free tours in diff languages and interactive materials also in several languages. Free admission comes with a free English/Korean book on the Korean War which you get from the lobby of the facility."
62,5.0,Both inside and outside a beautiful museum. Most information also provided in English. Planes and other military related vehicles outside. You'll be easily spending at least a whole afternoon here.
63,5.0,"We joined the free tour led by a veteran who speaks impeccable English! He really knew things and every detail of war. I enjoyed his humorous and educating guide. And surprisingly, there was a parade in the middle of the tour so we ended the tour in the middle and watch it. The show was stunning and and dance and music performed by the soldiers were excellent. The exhibit inside also told a coherent and engaging story of Korean history. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
64,5.0,very engaging and interesting museum where the history of korea explain. it helps me understand and appreciate korea culture a little more.i spent about 2-3 hours there
65,5.0,A most recommended for the people interested in the history. The Place has so much to offer that you can spend a whole day watching old war-related things.
66,5.0,this is another must see in s. korea... if you want to get a full spectrum view of the korean war from a slightly bias'd position please do not hesitate! its a beautiful representation and tribute to the lost and disgruntled veterans of one of our worst conflicts
67,5.0,"Really enjoyed outside and inside of this museum, and its free to enter so really worth a visit.Outside there are lots of planes, tanks and missiles displayed with some information (English and Korean) about each one. There is also a replica boat to climb on and take a look around.Inside there are a few different sections about Korea's war history. We spent some time looking around the sections about the Korean war of the 50's. Lots of information about how it started and how the UN got involved. It was a little repetative at times, with the occasional mistranslation into English, but was really interesting and enjoyable. There is a cafe inside with reasonably priced snacks and coffee. There is a restaurant and convenience store also on the site.... restaurant was reasonably priced and food was OK."
68,5.0,"Definitelly a must-see place when you're in Seoul. Huge museum with lots of interesting sights, inside, as well outside of the museum."
69,5.0,"They have many great statues, monuments and military hardware outside but the main reason for going is to learn more about the Korean War. The building is large and the information comprehensive without being overwhelming. It succeeds in giving the details and facts, as well as the human and emotional side. The main thing I took away from it was understanding that as this war CAME to them, that any local over 70 in Seoul LIVED through this devastation. Sobering but important."
70,5.0,I can barely read Korean but I got to read a letter from one of the soldiers and it's so heart breaking that I cried. Worth the visit. Nice to understand better Korean war.
71,5.0,A comprehensive look into war history in Korea. Covers conflict from centuries back as well as the Korean War. Would return - a great learning experience.
72,5.0,"I found this museum very interesting an factual, there are tanks, planes, rockets, guns an even a boat you can look at.Inside museum it gives you detailed accounts of all the wars in koreas history, i peesonally found the korean war very interesting.There are also exhibits an stories throughout the years to read an look at.They also do guided tours, id definately reccomemd it."
73,5.0,The Korean War (1950-1953) changed the history of Korea and East Asia.You can find the full detail of the war. 16 countries came here to fight against the Communist attack. Its free entrance. Sure you will enjoy the museum.
74,5.0,I cried realising the historical korean war... monuments and figures are perfectly crafted with symbolics and has story to tell.. most awesome..
75,5.0,Go if you want a primer on Korean war history from the last 2000 years.  This place is huge.  Set aside a good 3-4 hours to see everything. They even have a huge collection of life size aircraft and military vehicles outside. Best of all everything is free.
76,5.0,It's the best educational tour I attended. The museum walked me through time and the war that happened. Learned a lot from this place
77,5.0,"This place is filled with history not just for Korea but also from different countries,it's very educational.This place is a must visit,you will really learn about the war that happened between different races,but too bad we visited around Chuseok time and between 3 or 4 PM to 5 PM,we didn't have enough time to roam around in all areas because they close early during Chuseok."
78,5.0,"I've been to a few war memorials, and this one doesn't disappoint. I went to the Victorious Fatherland Memorial in North Korea, so it was good to see the otherside. Note: there is a bit of bias (as one would guess), so make sure you come in and reserch anythign that seems a bit not quite.... fully discolsed"
79,5.0,"It is very difficult to put the value of this Memorial into words. Perhaps it is too personal, and thereby subjective. Advice: go early, commit at least 1/2 day, take your time, and enjoy."
80,5.0,"This place is awesome.It was really cool to see all the planes, tanks and boats. Such interesting history and seeing the actual boat that had bullet holes in it from the most recent run in with North Korea was fascinating"
81,5.0,very well preserved and very well kept and provides a  lot of information on the Korean war. informative and wonderful place to visit
82,5.0,"This is one of the best museums I have visited, worldwide. On the outside there's a Korean War Memorial and plenty of static military vehicles (airplanes, boats, tanks, etc). On the inside, you venture through a very interactive display of Korea's history, from very early history to modern day. Many of the key Korean battles are reenacted through props, projections, and videos. It's a very large museum, so make sure you allot plenty of time explore it in its entirety ."
83,5.0,"Outdoor exhibition of Korean War era planes, tanks, armored vehicles, ships. Both Us, Korean, Russian and Chinese. Extensive exhibitions inside including terrific audio-video presentations. Some of the best I've seen anywhere. So much to see that it is difficult to do in one day. Recommend breaking it up so as to get the most from the experience."
84,5.0,This excellent museum really has some accessible displays that really help one to understand the Korean war and th struggle of the Korean people. I also really enjoyed the the historical section on the lower floors. The volunteer guides are really helpful too.
85,5.0,"We all learn about the Korean War (a little anyways) in high school history class. To us it is always that little thing in between WWII and Vietnam. This museum is really good at demonstrating that the Korean War was a war of survival for the people of South Korea. It also takes a different view of a lot. Americans seems to always view it through the lens of ""and then we save South Korea,"" whereas they view it as a war of survival in which others aided them. It also gives a really good idea of the international involvement. Ultimately a ""must see"" when visiting Seoul."
86,5.0,"A place to be reminded why we should choose peace.  Expect to be teary eyed specially at ""the drop"".  Watching and learning the different stories of heroes, kindness and selfless acts despite the ugliness of war would also restore your faith in humanity.Tip: start with the top floor; wheelchair accessible; multilingual materials available; free entrance"
87,5.0,This is a very nice museum with multiple floors. Make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time as this could easily take up an entire day. You may want to get a tour as doing it by yourself can be overwhelming.
88,5.0,"The War Memorial is a vast landmark that speaks volumes to the measure of feeling South Koreans have related to not only the unfinished war and all that came before and after it.  The grounds alone could occupy you for over an hour and the inside  could keep you busy all day. Not only does it include the three exhibits related to the Korean War, the third and final being a moving homage to the nation's who answered call to aid ""people they never met and a country they never knew"", there are also numerous exhibits on Korea's older history,  including the Joseon Dynasty, the Japanese occupation and other special exhibits that change regularly. For any of the culturally curious or historically fascinated, this is an absolute must in Seoul."
89,4.0,"I visited in company of friends this war museum and was amazed to see planes,  vehicles, war ship etc used in the Korean War. The history is documented in every little space in the museum, and can be a source of information for both military historians and other people who are interested.You need to spend some hours in this monument whenever you visit Seoul."
90,5.0,"Growing up on US and European history, the war memorial provided a lot of insight into Korean and Asian history that was missing from my knowledge bank.  It was interesting to walk around, I would allot a few hours for this memorial before continuing to tackle wandering around Seoul."
91,4.0,"We spent 2-3 hours walking through the museum and military equipment.  Read stories about the heroic actions during the war and learned a lot more about the history before and during the war.  It was Free, so very worth it."
92,5.0,"If you are in Seoul and have a few hours to spare, this museum has to be the greatest place to learn about the troubled history of this divided nation.The place is huge and you can easyly spend several hours looking at the exhibits and installations. There are loads of audio-visual exhibits too. You can see, that they really put huge efforts into making this place as interesting and informative as possible.The museum is divided into an outside and an inside part. Outdoors there is a huge collection of tanks, planes, and other vehicles from both sides. Including a 1:1 replica of the PKM-357, a South Korean vessel, sunken by the North in 2002. The bullet hole riddled hull will remind you in an impressive way, that these two countries are actually still at war to this day.On the inside there are loads of Installations and exhibits describing the whole conflict between the South and the North (and their respective Allies)."
93,5.0,"Initially, when my cousin recommended paying a visit, I was a little skeptical..... However, we ended up spending close to 2 1/2 hours walking through the grounds!!!!!   It was simply amazing.. almost to the point of information overload!!!!  Being an Air Force brat, i have to say it brought back some old-time memories... but enough of memory lane.... The memorial would be a great trip.. as adults.. and especially if their kids invovled....the displays were impressive... from the displayed text for each of the artifacts.. to the interactive monitors/displays... it was extremely fascinating...... The memorial covers a fairly large extensive time-period!!! it is definitely a must see!!!!"
94,5.0,"There are not enough words to express how amazing and heartwrenching the War Memorial is. I think everyone should experience the journey through a war most people have limited knowledge of...but one which had/has a worldwide impact even today.Phenomenal internal design and display layout. Planes, tanks, boats, and military equipment to explore.Monuments and statues that pay honor to military and civilians alike.Displays and videos are in several languages, including English.Ohhh...and did I mention...FREE admission.O"
95,5.0,In a flash the museum provides much needed information about South Korea and its history. It is a must see site for every visitor to The Republic of Korea
96,5.0,"Definitely a must do if in Seoul. The English guided tour was incredibly worthwhile and I came away knowing so much more about the recent history of Korea which made it even more amazing to see how the country had advanced in a very short period of time. It also made my visit to the DMZ and JSA much more meaningful having this background. Even if you're not really a museum person, you will enjoy this museum."
97,5.0,Only other war museums that I have been to that compare are Canberra - Australia and Ho Chi Minh - Vietnam. This one has everything - if you love history allow 4 hours if your a skimmer then 2 hours. They have free English guide would recommend this very informative. Great outdoor section with planes and ships. Very well done and beautiful garden/building. They even have a 3D survivor story which was great.
98,5.0,"Great museum abouy Korean war history from the hunting and gathering era till the Vietnam War. From 4D to holograms, this museum captivates you with high quality story telling!"
99,5.0,"I went there only for the Korean war, but this museum also about wars in ancient times. If you want to learn about every detail of the Korean war, it takes you 4-5 hours at least.The design is very good. There is a lot of interactive media for you to learn. There are also 4D and 3D movies available. From the museum, I can tell Koreans are grateful for those countries who helped. Outside the museum, there are wreaths dedicated to different countries. There is an exhibition room introducing what each country did at the war. At the entrance, you can get an English book for free about the everyday progress at the war.They even have a veteran volunteer. You can take pictures with him."
100,5.0,This place is close to my home and I have visited there several times. It has both free and paid exhibition halls. You can learn a lot about Korean war history as well as about its allies. You can easily get there from Samgajki station Line 4 and 6. This place is close to Seoul Station. There is a pond and fountain outside. I highly recommend to visit this place. If you are taking Seoul City Bus tour. There is a stop here.
101,5.0,"Beautiful museum inside and outside (make sure to explore outside as well). There is so much to go through - you could easily spend 1 day in there. Everything is so well thought of. There are different sections and I recommend that you take the pamphlet and go through each section in the recommended order to have a much better understanding (some of the info may seem a bit biased though but that would make sense). There are also 4D films. We went to one of them and had to line up. It's not that great if you're looking for a thrilling ride but kids will enjoy it. They usually run hourly and last under 10 min but when we went on a Friday, they ran it every 15 min as of 4PM I believe, because there were a lot of people. Note that the museum closes at 6PM and they start pushing people to leave at 5:45PM :P"
102,5.0,a very moving and poigniant memorial to this tragic and still on going conflict.Well worth a visit .This is an often forgotton conflict for Brits  which is very sad
103,3.0,"Went there in the afternoon. It was raining so I didn't take much great pictures. It was a good place to visit for information of the Korea War. But having visited the DMZ, I think this pales compared to what I have experienced.Still, it was good for people who didn't go to DMZ. I compared this to my cuchi tunnel experience in Vietnam. Everything comes more alive if you go to the actual area to experience it."
104,5.0,"Having visited most of the museums in Seoul, this one was the most interesting. Great feature on the Korean War."
105,5.0,I went here with a friend and we were expecting a stereotypical war memorial. But this one was so cool! The architecture was beautiful! There was so much to see and there was a lot immersive experiences that helped you understand what was going on. There was even a 4F experience and video art installations. It was beautifully done. There were tonnes of English translations or general English as well for people like me 👍 which made my personal experience more enjoyable. Also there were stories about previous wars not just the Korean War 1950. Highly highly recommend!
106,5.0,"Out of all the places that I visited, I enjoyed this location the most.  Hands down, this is a great museum.  The museum is laid out very well, story of the history of Korea is very easy to follow."
107,5.0,My grandfather was in the Korean War.  I found it fascinating to walk through this museum and see the progression of the war and to learn about the history of the continuing war between North Korea and South Korea.
108,5.0,"This place is big and amazing, and it is free... You must visit this place, it is not only a War Memorial but more a History of Korea Museum. Easy to access with subway, you will need half a day to visit this massive area."
109,5.0,"This museum remembers the not too distant past in which many nations participated to help South Korea be what it is today. Entry is free and one feels the gratitude the country has for the assistance it so badly needed, layered over the national and personal pain its citizens still feel, but bravely cope with."
110,4.0,"We spent about 3 hours here, but didn't get to see everything.  It was enough though because we felt a little like death by museum by the time we left.  We took a free English tour of the museum, but didn't feel as though it was helpful.  Our guide just read out the headings of the main sections that we were entering and didn't really explain much.  He pointed towards major items waving his hand vaguely, greeted other guests, and then took phone calls on his cell.  We felt like it was a wasted hour.We walked around the museum alone after the tour for another two hours.  I'd recommend to watch the videos places strategically at each entrance to a new area instead of going on the free tour.  They give u an idea of what is to come and what you're looking at because the English translations of things are brief.They have a few interactive activities there which were fun for both adults and kids.  There were also two movie theaters in there that only played during specific times.  They looked interesting, but we didn't get to see them.  We either missed it or didn't want to wait another hour for the next showing.  Probably if we spent half a day here we could have seen everything."
111,5.0,Exemplary work. The memorial is a tribute to the Korean people and all the allied nations who contributed. The attached museum is very well done as well. This should be on your must-visit lost for Seoul.
112,5.0,"The memorial is like nothing I have seen before and gives you a good insight into the Korean war.You really do get a sense of how proud this country is about their accomplishments from the past and you will learn a lot! I loved this place so much that I made sure I visited on my second trip too.This place is massive. Allow plenty of time to walk around. I took a packed lunch and ate near the tanks and planes. I think this place is great for anyone - families, solo or travelling with friends."
113,5.0,"This place is huge, haunting and interesting - an amazing museum experience. You should allocate at least 3 hours, so come before 3pm, as it closes at 6pm.There are three ""Korean War Rooms"", and we spent an hour or so in each.Recommended for anyone visiting Seoul."
114,5.0,"This war memorial is a tribute to all who lost their lives in a crucial part of preserving Korea!  The grounds are kept up well, the monuments and information were very engaging and kept the visitors moving!  I highly recommend for the history or military buff!"
115,4.0,"Very nice museum with a lot of detailed and interactive information ! Don't wait for the 4D theatre, but if you're there on time try it. It's fun."
116,4.0,This is the place to go to learn about the Korean war history and also the current relations with North Korea. It's a very moving museum with a lot of emphasis placed on peace and reuniting with Nkorea. Definitely give yourself 2-3 hours for a decent visit.
117,5.0,"O.convenient tranceportation by subway train.     0.no entrance fee and can get useful pamplets and memorial book.    0. Great sight room on the second room - Korean War 1, 2   0.Many real used troops include Tanks and bomb airplanes.   0. Enough parking lots and cheap fee.    0. Affordable for all ages."
118,5.0,"Great and interactive experience that all history lovers have to add to their itinerary while visiting Seoul. I was actually crying at the end but isn't this the purpose to remind us what we must not allow to happen again? Museum for adult and child, regardless of if you are into understanding or not the nature of the war itself."
119,5.0,Very good place for everybody whi wants to know a lot of about Korean War.Even it is closed on Monday still it is worth to come to see outsite exhibition.free
120,4.0,Amazing statues and museum. When I went there was a militar presentation which was so cool! Worth it!
121,5.0,"The Korean War separated numerous families, Korea is still recovering from this war and hoping for reunification. I didn't go in the museum, but did enjoy  the memorial area with the sculptures as well as military equipment."
122,5.0,Amazing place near to a subway station. Free entrance. The place is really nice if you are interested in the korean war or if your country support south korea as Colombia did for example. You will be proud to see your flag but sad for the people who died there.
123,5.0,"It's must visit place if you are in Seoul, lot of things to see regarding war history of Korea. And best part is that it's free"
124,3.0,By visiting korean war memorial you can know the past of the koreans which is located just in front of American military base camp.
125,5.0,Great to walk around. Very respectful to the ones that lost their lives in battles. This Memorial is free and open to the public.
126,5.0,"Few of my favorite places in every destination are Parks. When my friend invited me to go to this place, i have no second thought to agree... well, being new to the place, I was curious about what the country was experience during the WWII. Well, I was so very proud to know that Philippines is part of the Korean War."
127,5.0,"The public buildings in Seoul are on a grand scale. All the museums we have visited are impressive but because of the purpose of this building perhaps the grandest of them. We just missed the guided tour so decided to do it on our own. Which didn't strike us as a handicap.I agree with the review by 40girl, and therefore also highly recommended. The Korean War onwards I thought would be most interesting, but the history of Korea is extraordinary and extremely well presented using different media. Also provided with a free book on the Korean War in English, but numbers might be limited as there were many when we entered in the morning but got the last one when we left (2 hours later).Highly Recommended."
128,5.0,Awesome museum.  Very nice collection of artifacts from many centuries of war and conflict in the region.
129,5.0,"If you are a history buff, or you are just interested in planes, tanks and other military equipment, this is the place for you.  They have an outdoor area featuring real planes and tanks and even a ship.  Inside the museum there are lots of interesting things to look at and free tours."
130,4.0,"Spend half a day, free, full of details, to learn a lesson of Korean history. Images and videos depicting the develop of the modern state of Korea, all the wars that surround it and the objects that mimic the environment that finally turn into this modern state. They show the power, in a poetic way, that the war with N. Korea didn't let the unification of the ideals of globalization and modernism that defines S. Korea."
131,3.0,"nice Sunday thing to do. It's free so why not? Though I feel like some parts of the exhibition kind of glorifies war to an extent, it is still a nice visit."
132,5.0,"It's more of a museum than memorial. We missed the English tour, so they apologized and sent over another english speaking tour guide, a kid from stanford doing his military service. Learned so much from his enthusiastic tour. Definitely would recommend."
133,5.0,"So much to see in a day !  We visited this amazing place with family and learned so much about the country at the same time. There are a number of planes, tanks, helicopters and a small frigate along with missiles all outside the museum all with good description in English.Once inside the main building a whole history of Korea opens up and by the time you leave you have an insight into this wonderful country. An in depth understanding of the Korean War is a focal point and the memorials outside to all the country's who went to Koreas aid is interesting in its own merit.I found the work done after the war quite interesting and shows how the country changed over the years and why Korea is as advanced as it is now.I would certainly recommend a whole day at this attraction there is so much to see"
134,5.0,I have visited the War Memorial of Korea on many occasions and always been impressed with the displays here. As a New Zealander i love the way South Korea acknowledges and appreciates the help many other countries gave during the war. A tribute that is worth visiting. A very moving experience.
135,4.0,Good place to visit as an sightseeing.  Many information for the Korean war and related real weapons and stories....
136,5.0,"I visited the War Memorial on a number of occasions and came away moved and impressed every time.   I took students there on field trips three different times and visited with friends several other times,  and I can assure you there is something for everyone.  This should definitely be on your list of things to see in Seoul.  Give yourself plenty of time because you'll want to be able to absorb the information and the emotional impact.   A definite must see."
137,5.0,One of the best things to do in Seoul and cost nothing. Very educational and enlightening on the Korean Conflict.
138,5.0,"This museum is a must see to learn about the history of Korea.  Beautiful museum and memorial and nice display of airplanes, tanks and equipment outside with a children's play area for the little ones.  Very nice."
139,5.0,"This place has it all.  Covering the early paleolithic days of Korea right up to the modern day, there is nothing about Korean civilization and its various wars that is overlooked.  Inside, you'll find all the expected exhibits with uniforms, guns, maps, recreations, etc.  Outside though, there is a massive array of planes, tanks, missiles, and even ships.  Be sure to seek shelter under the B-52 for a spell if the Seoul summer heat becomes too much.  The statues and parade ground are a nice touch as well.  Overall, this is a must-see if you want to get a general grasp of Korea at war."
140,4.0,"we joined a tour in english, and it was very interesting to learn about the war of the two koreas. it adds content to the trip."
141,5.0,"Large museum which spans the Korean history, but with great focus on the most recent UN War with the North. Outside has some great aircraft including a B52. Put aside the entire day, or go more than once. Oh, and its FREE."
142,5.0,Am so amazed with the different war memorabilia displays and other equipments used during the Korean war.
143,4.0,Great re-visit of the Forgotten War....tells the story with excellent displays. Flows well and Historically is quite accurate.
144,5.0,"I supposed a lot of tourists visit South Korea because of interest and influence from K-Pop. This is 1 place with free Entrance us tourists to find out more about their history, on top of just K-Pop.I've been to South Korea many times but have never visited this attraction.After my visit, I regretted not going earlier and I will visit again my next trip.The Museum provides free Guided Tour in English. Not too sure about other languages as we happened to chance upon the Guided Tour timing.There's 3 levels in the Museum and the Guided Tour is only for Level 1. It took more then 2 hours for the tour to end as it's very informative.There's also outdoor exhibits...If you are a Museum Go-er, half a day may not be sufficient if you were to take your time to go thru everything."
145,4.0,"I recommend this place for any visitors who wants to learn more about the Korean war.There are English tour guides but they start at 2pm, but it can be visited without a tour guide as everything is written in English."
146,5.0,"Visited this place right after my DMZ/JSA tour with Koridoor since their office is located close by. I could spend an entire day in here going through the models of planes, tanks etc. and war artifacts displayed in this memorial. It is a VERY informative place to learn about the history of Korea and the Korean War."
147,5.0,"Both,  beautiful and sad at the same time. The history behind the monument is so very touching.  How families were split and to never see each other again..There is always hope."
148,5.0,"The War Memorial is a museum of artifacts and displays of the fantastic history of the Korean Peninsula, including the Hideyoshi invasions of 1592 and 1598 and the Korean War of 1950 - 53 which ended not in a peace treaty but rather in an Armistice Agreement.All sorts of displays are presented, including weapons systems and the famous Turtle Boat.  The museum is located near the former Japanese Army compound currently the home of the United Nations Command, the ROK/US Combined Forces Command, and U.S, Eighth Army.Well worth visiting.  If you want to see it all, plan on an afternoon, since it's easy to get distracted by all the exhibits."
149,4.0,War memorials are normally solemn places to visit and more so this particular one as it showed how people of the same race fighting over two ideology and a nation divided between North and South Korea.
150,4.0,"I hate wars and everything that has something to do with it, so I don't even like war museums, because they sometimes are a bit patriotic or even glorify the war.And yes, you sometimes get exactly this feeling, when visiting this musuem, but still it's a big and interesting museum, with a lot of things to look at.We didn't had much time, when we went there, but you can really get lost in all the exhibitions. The entrance is free, so you can't go wrong - leave if you don't like it."
151,4.0,One get to know about pretty much everything on Korean War but may not be from a neutral perspective.  Interesting exhibit but do expect a lot of walking though.
152,5.0,"we walked around for at least 4 hours. this is an excellent memorial and museum for the wars of Korea. some rooms are haunting. all are extremely respectful. I recommend any visitor to Seoul, spend a few hours here."
153,5.0,"We came here in the afternoon after a few other sight-seeings.The museum is huge so if you don't have a lot of time, chose which part to visit wisely!I only came here because my husband asked me to but I loved it. It has a lot on the Korean war and other things related to wars. Well worth a visit."
154,5.0,"The War Memorial has an excellent display of historical artefacts and the outdoor exhibit is fantastic. As a tourist, this site is a must see and provides some context to the Korean War, a very important event in the history of South Korea.We were short on time but for a family, this can be a good activity for half a day. It is very easy to navigate to the site via the railway."
155,5.0,"Amazing exhibits with English translations. So much to see here. The collection of planes, tanks, and artillery outside the museum are great for photo ops. We came on a national holiday and unfortunately the museum closed 2 hours early. We will definitely come back to view the rest of the exhibits."
156,5.0,"This museum and memorial is a great place. Its free of charge, got a large exhibition and is also very educating. The museum got an indoor section over 3 floors and an outdoor section. The Outdoor section is mostly a few monuments to honor the once who fought the korean war and also a section with lots of full size military vehicles used during the decades of conflict on the korean peninsula. In the outdoor part you get to see planes, tanks and even a boat from the korean war. The indoor exhibition is over 3 floors, each covering different parts of war history of korea. It goes all the war from ancient times with the three kindoms era to koreas involvement with Un relief work. In other words load of history to see and learn. Take note that this place is also a must visit for local schools so dont be surprised if you find yourself surrounded by children on a field trip. But dont fear, korean children are very well mannered and you wont see children running around and making a lot of noise.Visit this place on a cloudy day, dont go there if its rainy if you want to enjoy the outdoor exhibit."
157,5.0,"This was an amazing experience. My friends and I are going to the DMZ in a couple of days, and we thought it would make sense to catch up on the history regarding the Korean War - and we are not disappointed! This museum has it all, and it's definitely worth a visit - take your time since it's a huge area!"
158,5.0,"This was a good intro to our trip to Seoul.  There is a large outside area with planes, tanks and boats plus some Memorials.  Then a large (free) inside area that you could spend a few hours in.  Keep in mind this is not just the Korean War Memorial but the Memorial to ALL war in Korea.  Vietnam included."
159,5.0,"A place for memorial war. I visited some place in the word but this place is impressive.The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. Well worth your time to visit."
160,5.0,"Not only is the memorial amazing in terms of statues and old war vehicles, but it is also in Iteawon which is a very cute neighborhood and has great food options from all over the world. I would recommend going there after lunch, spend the afternoon there and then have dinner down the road towards the metro, tons of little shops if you are keen on that too."
161,4.0,This museum  is really nice and you definitely learn about their culture and other things.  Is big and when we went there was a woo boat in tbe middle of it inside. They do have the war memorial as well as other exhibits land actual planes and tanks outside.
162,5.0,"While I was in Korea on vacation I went to the war memorial with a supplier representative from a company I do business with. Toured the entire memorial, it covered the entirety of the Korean war from the origins to resolution. As you move through the exhibit you can encounter and speak with volunteers who recount their experiences either in the military or living in Korea at the time. It was truly an inspiring experience to be able to speak with people who actually lived in Korea while the war occurred and hear their stories. The memorial also covered a significant portion of Korean history as a whole it is not just dedicated to the Korean war. You can find a large amount of military hardware on site as well both inside and outside the museum."
163,5.0,You may wonder why the U.S./UN/NATO troops go into obscure countries until you go to this museum.  The atrocities committed against humans anywhere is against us all.  This museum is VERY nice and free.  Make a point to visit it.
164,4.0,"The war memorial museum and surrounding grounds were quite interesting to walk around. It's not too large so you could cover everything in under 3hrs, I think.I viewed and read the historical exhibition on the first floor and it was well laid out and easy to navigate. It was educational, unemotive and child friendly.I found the outdoor sculptures, weapons and war vehicles were the most interesting part of the whole facility.Also, there is a cafe, a canteen and an Italian restaurant on the museum grounds."
165,5.0,"Lots of old war equipment you can look at...tanks, aircraft, etc.  Inside are historical artifacts.  free to visit.  not too much in english.   Not too bad but if u don't speak Korean...mostly just looking and the descriptions in English are quite sparse."
166,5.0,"I have visited a couple of war museums in Vietnam, London and Paris and I must say that the Seoul War Museum is outstanding by its design and the interactivity of the expositions."
167,5.0,"We were a group of about 50 of us (mostly kids) and very limited time, but what an amazing museum. Not everything was in English, but enough was to be able to enjoy the exhibits."
168,5.0,This is a great museum that everyone should take the time to see. It has exhibits for Korean history and also for the Korean War. Very interesting!
169,5.0,This museum is brilliant. The whole exhibition is really well translated into English. There are also free guided tours of the museum a couple of times a day which are worth doing. The museum is massive and takes a few hours to see it properly. There  are also many army vehicles including tanks and planes outside which are cool and would be brilliant if you were with kids.
170,4.0,"Beyond all the war planes, tanks, rockets exhibits, & ship, i  was just happy to see our flag among those of all nations that sent support to the Korean army during the war. It was a great memory."
171,5.0,Very impressive and well done museum. If you're a history buff and interested in the Korean War this is definitely a do not miss stop.
172,5.0,"Haven't been for a year but I had some Turkish visitors keen to visit so off we went. I was struck at first by how interesting it is every time I visit. And, now that I am visiting through the eyes of foreign visitors, I can see how sympathetically it is set up, with equal weight given to each country that fought in this war. The outside display of decommissioned hardware was particularly notable, especially for the only B52 on view outside of the Smithsonian"
173,5.0,This museum is really good and really interesting! Outside there is a collection of military vehicles including tanks and planes you can wander around. One of the more worth while musuems in Korea.
174,4.0,"The first impression that hits you when you arrive at the museum is that it is very very big. In fact it is the largest war memorial museum in the world. It has several mini screenings about the conflicts in Korea which was quite interesting. The memorial covers wars from the kingdom periods to the Korean War. In my opinion it is less graphic as the Vietnam War Remnants Museum in HCM and takes a more subtle approach of honouring those who fought in the war rather than the graphic brutality of the wars themselves. Love the monuments in front of the building. Also the tanks, planes, helicopters and warship...Yes a warship outside the museum. Really worth a visit."
175,5.0,It's a very impressive monument to just remember the cost of freedom! The area is in very good shape and walking through it will make you know what it took for Korea to achieve their independence! All the instruments of war also very impressive!
176,5.0,"I was impressed about this memorial. It has a lot of planes and tanks from the WWII from Korean and US. it is located near Samgakji station, very easy to reach with the subway. Good for kids too."
177,4.0,"Very good exhibits.  The park was well kept.  Nice, clean and extremely educational.  I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history."
178,5.0,"The War Memorial should be early in any Seoul visitor's itinerary. The museum, which is free, traces the history of the Korean peninsula in a clear and understandable way. Coverage of the Korean War is, understandably, very thorough, and I learned a ton about the conflict. I would set aside several hours for a visit, as it's definitely not a small museum. As an aside, there's a really good museum restaurant in a separate building on the grounds."
179,5.0,"Great museum/memorial highlighting history of Korean warfare.  I thought this was only for the Korean War, but it covers much more.  Very nice displays and great examples of various uniforms, weapons, and craft.  Did I mention there is no fee- this is completely free!!!  We took the metro here and got a little confused where the entrance was, as it was not properly marked with signs on the street. There is a place to get a snack as well. Make sure to take a walk outside and view the aircraft and tanks."
180,5.0,"A place must visit , cannot be missed .Only 15 minutes from Chungmoro station - sangaji station walk about 5 minutes to the location . Big Location with big space with aircraft , tanks , ship and heavy machine guns used during Korean War Also you have 2 floor building with another memorial to be visited . Will take half day to complete the tour -worth a visit and reading all the facts of history 👍"
181,5.0,Took our four kids here and spent four hours wandering around.  We ran out of time or we would have stayed there all day!  Get there early at 9 before Korea wakes up and the crowds begin.  Take your time and follow the prompts!  The museum was done to give you the full experience of war and it does so REALLY well!  The UN Corridor was my kids favorite and the tear drop exhibit brought me to just that.  Can't wait to go back and see more!
182,5.0,Very interesting and well presented memorial.We can easly spend half a day in the memorial. Most interesting place visited so far in Seoul
183,5.0,외국인 친구가 DMZ에 가고 싶어했어했는데 못가서 대신 전쟁기념관에 갔습니다.한국전쟁을 비롯 전쟁에 대해 잘 알 수 있는 좋은시간이엇네요 It's a place that you can learn about korean war and korean military.It costs free and it was much better than what i expected.Me and my friend visited here instead of DMZ.
184,4.0,"This place has large collection of tanks, planes and other war things. would recommend for kids not so much for couples. a great museum nonetheless."
185,4.0,This is place that is great for kids and those who feel like kids. I wouldn't recommend this for couples.
186,5.0,The memorial is rather a complete museum. There are many displays and a lot of history in the place. You need a few hours to look at the display. The memorials are detailed and a great piece of art. Well worth a visit to take in the history of Korea's armed conflicts.
187,5.0,"The museum is huge so be prepared to spend there at least 3 hours. Inside you can see memorials of the Korean war and learn about it not only ny reading but also with different videos, exhibitions and a 10-minute-long 3D movie.Outside is a wide exhibition of airplanes, tanks, ships and a kids area."
188,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the war memorial. It showcases the Korean War in a detailed way..entry is free and it will take around 4-5 hours to see the entire memorial at a good pace. It is very well maintained and the collections are amazing with all the war planes, tanks, jeeps etc"
189,5.0,"I have never before visited a landmark where I learned so much history! I highly recommend the museum; anyone can visit: children, older folks, any nationality. Detailed documentation from the UN, pictures, lots of information about the many countries which sent troops, and the many brave men who gave all. I am so impressed with the effort to repel the aggression shown by the North Koreans, the Red Chinese, and The USSR."
190,5.0,"This is a well designed museum with a lot of interesting artifacts! Being ignorant I assumed the museum focused on the Korean War, but it is a total history of wars in Korea. I was super impressed with the design and impact of the museum."
191,5.0,The Memorial tells the story of Korean War that began June 26 1950 and has yet to be resolved although hostilities ceased with the armistice in 1953.However the Memorial is much more.  It is also a tribute by a grateful nation to all those countries that provided assistance in their hour of need.
192,5.0,This is a beautiful memorial to remember the fallen soldiers of the Korean War. The grounds of this war Memorial are pristine. The monuments are beautiful. If you're able to go on memorial day in Korea 6/25. There is an amazing ceremony.
193,4.0,"Interesting and outdoors, this is one of the must-see attractions in Seoul. Large scale and a good spot for photographs."
194,5.0,Great review all the history btw North and South Korea War.  Can imagine the people life is full of pain and hard during the period.
195,5.0,You shouldn't miss this place. They have already exhibit of actual guns and tanks that you can have photo opportunities.
196,5.0,"Firstly, this place is incredibly big! I went with friends and we spent almost 2hours just on the outdoor exhibit area alone. Displayed in the outdoor exhibition area are all manners of tanks, planes, AA/AT guns, and helicopters. For those interested in war history/machines but not served in military, I feel this is the best place to see some of these up close and personal. The collection included US/Korean/Soviet/Chinese models as well.Inside the museum itself, I found the section on the Korean War really informative and fascinating. Having grown up in a country not involved in the war, it was interesting to get an introduction to some of the issues, key dates & personnel. It sparked my interest to read more about it now that I'm back home.Well worth a visit for the military history buffs"
197,5.0,This place is giant. Tons of things to see with many years of war history inside. We got there towards the end of the day so we were a little rushed. The exhibits were way cool.
198,5.0,"For all history buffs and cultural enthusiasts, this memorial which is free to enter is a great place to spend hours getting lost in their Korea's extensive history. What is more remarkable is their extensive coverage as well as use of eye catching videos, visuals, statues, 4D rides, models, posters, real life relics. Amazing place!"
199,5.0,"A must-visit at Seoul, the museum really showcases the warring histories of Korea from the beginning of time till today.A large majority of the displays are dedicated to the Korean War period and even a history buff like myself saw so many things that I never knew existed, including telegrams to Stalin from Kim, or if that doesn't appeal to you, there are multiple 4D shows and modern exhibits including recent conflicts with the North."
200,5.0,This is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. You can feel the great-fullness had by the Korea people for the sacrifices so many have made in the years of conflict. The displays are incredible both inside and outside the building.
201,5.0,"The museum is easily accessible, its free entry, free tour guides, a lot of history and culture can be learned here, not just about the Korean War but also how the evolution of Korean weapons and vehicles were made, as well as how Korean army would look like in the future. Really cool stuff."
202,4.0,It takes three or four hours to finish the exhibition. Very informative and much fun for learning Korean history.
203,4.0,"This is a huge museum and memorial. While the museum focus is on the Korean War with its ongoing issues, it also contains displays and information on the history of the Korean peninsula, its peoples and culture and its interactions with its neighbours. It provides an insight to the anguish the South Koreans suffer by being split into two and their desire for reunification.The museum has an comprehensive explanation on the causes of the Korean War, its progress ( and how close it came to be over-run) and the final outcomes. Add to this the extensive display of military machines, aircraft and ships inside and out. All the display boards are multi-lingual.The memorial wall lists all those that gave their lives from all the participating countries along with country specific markers around the central courtyard listing the sacrifices these countries made to the war.Plan for a long day to explore all that it has to offer including some of the ever popular ""3D"" experiences that are run regularly. It has a number of small cafes for food and drinks. Oh and don't forget - while it is free, it is closed Mondays."
204,3.0,Was only lucky enough to see the museum from the outside as I wasn't aware they closed their doors on Monday. Putting it out there so no one misses out like me. Will be my must do's when I come back to Seoul
205,4.0,"Spent about 3.5 hours here. Very good for a history lesson. There are indoors and outdoors. On the outdoors, you can see tanks and planes that were used in the warOn the indoors there are 3 levels here so take your time to walk around. There are information on every display. Take your time to read or take a picture.  Some rooms have a short 3-D movie about 5 mins. Its really exciting. Please be quiet here (especially if you are indoors) and if you have children because this is not allowed for kids running around or talking loudly"
206,5.0,Very touching and emotional one if you lost a loved one during the Korean War...we did rubbings of our loved ones names on the bronze Wall of Remberance on mulberry paper. Museum was very historical. Great visit!
207,5.0,"Right up there with the Imperial War Museum London and the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Many exhibits of the surprising violent Korean past (outside of the 1950 war). Lots of exhibits, with strong focus on the north/south divide. It takes a good couple of hours to see the place in full including the array of aircraft and armored vehicles outside including a B52!"
208,5.0,"Truly an amazing experience. This country has so much war history, to even have the chance to learn a small bit about it while I was here was unbelievably fascinating.  You couldn't visit South Korea and not make a trip here.  Well worth it!!"
209,5.0,"Spent the morning going through the museum among Korean kids on a field trip who were delighted to practice their English on us with many ""Hellos"" and giggles. This museum covers wars in Korea from the very beginning with many interesting exhibits. Me, my sister and nephew were mostly interested in the Korean War as our father (grandfather) served in that war. We were glad we visited and this is a museum not to be missed if you are in Seoul for any length of time."
210,5.0,"i love this museum. i could find all information about war memorial between south and north korea. the place are big, from inside and outside are awesome place, i could find movie 3D about war memorial of korea"
211,5.0,We had 2 hours to spend and ran out of time. This is an interactive and huge museum with lots of nice + real objects!!Truly the best in Seoul and free of charge even!We certainly plan to go back.
212,5.0,When rain descended on Seoul we decided to visit this museum and it was incredible. The museum is free although donations are appreciated. A lot of the museum is dedicated to the war in the 50's and this is clearly set out with lots of information and many interactive exhibits. It's truly humbling. The upper floor is almost solely dedicated to outlining the support relieved from their allies and everyone country is thanked in detail showing how their individual support helped the effort. The memorials outside are equally thought provoking and stunning. If you visit Seoul this is a must see to help you understand the incredibly history of Korea which affects them to this day.
213,5.0,"I wish I had more time to spend at this War Memorial. I have always looked up to those men and women who have served our country. Great information and fun war equipment (artillery, vehicles, aircraft, etc.) to see."
214,5.0,"I am always interested in war memorial because it is an amazing thing to learn the history and constantly reminding us the importance of peace. My favourite exhibition hall was Hall 3, the United Nations. All the tanks, aircrafts and warships would fascinate you and I reckon kids would like to see those big planes. It is a great place to visit and spend the day and actually learn something."
215,5.0,"I had read some reviews, but still did not know what to expect. It was so much more than I expected. I did not know much of the History behind the Korean was, but this was really interesting. They had so many different ways of showing it, from videos to big screen cinema and a lot of weapons and stuff from the war. It was all made exciting and a lot of museums around the world, could learn from this place. Well done. The museum is also bigger than I thought. The section outside with tanks and planes was fun as well, that part is sure to be a hit with children. And the whole thing is FREE. I would not mind paying some money to see it, but that was a nice touch. Outside they have a memorial stone for the different countries that helped during the war. Nice touch ."
216,5.0,My grandfather is a Korean war memorial. I want to visited this place . It was big and very historical.
217,5.0,I recommend everyone take the time come here and see this. It so moving. It puts into perspective what we may not have been alive to understand
218,4.0,"For us Europeans it is a bit too much and too extensive the description of the Korean War.  Remarkably, lots of korean-style new media is applied to keep young generation interested (4D room with real snow, e.g.) as the current youngsters might feel much different towards the North (why should we care, is the question). So conclude w/o DPRK story told would sound different. Its a great museum and tells of a nation that underwent a horrible time post WW2, and the combined effort of UN Forces to keep the freedom and not let it go the sowjet-style way..."
219,3.0,"Nothing really special about it, I have seen more impressive Korean war memorials in several locations in US."
220,5.0,"I'm not a HUGE museum person, but I fell in love with this place. It's built for people with short attention spans who still want to see a lot of history. A must stop in Seoul."
221,5.0,Great visit for a half day activity. The outdoor area has several static displays and the inside museum area provides a thorough history of the Korean War. Really wonderful for veterans and history enthusiasts.
222,5.0,"This museum is an incredibly well put together history of military engagement in Korea, with an emphasis on the Korean War.  It manages to set a tone that is somber but hopeful, grateful to Korea's allies yet proudly strong and independent.  I have made a point of visiting this museum on every trip to Korea and will likely visit again.  While this museum is a great rainy day activity, it's worth stopping by during nice weather to roam around the outdoor park with static displays of various military equipment."
223,4.0,"War memorial of Korea is a very well laid out museum of the Korean war. It caters for both Korean and English speakers. The museum had multiple levels and very clean facilities, It can be done in a short time or if you wish to see as much as possible a few hours could be spent here as well."
224,4.0,"Called in here as part of another tour, so spent about an hour here. I am sad to admit, I had very little knowledge of the Korean War, so spent a while getting myself up to speed. Fantastic displays, the information is well presented, and very easy to get your head around Well worth it"
225,3.0,Not the best thing to see in seoul in my opinion...if you wanted to know more about the war...this is place to be...full of tanks ships and planes used in the war....the statue is nicely done...
226,5.0,Extremely well laid out and presented and with all English sub titles. The hands on experience outside with a vast array of military vehicles and planes was really great.
227,5.0,"Our intent was to visit the National Museum but got off at the wrong stop and so happy that we did.  This place is so well organized.  Incorporates the history and experiences so well.  You can feel the pride, hope and gratitude of the Korean people here.  The outdoor exhibits with lots of tanks, planes and other war vessels are a must see.  Well worth the accidental stop!"
228,5.0,"We joined the Seoul city tour and this was our second stop. This place is really big and it is so well displayed for all that we needed to know about warfare, weapons and vehicles. We didn't managed to go through the entire site coz it was really big. We missed the outside monuments coz we concentrated on the inside. I really would recommend this place very much evening though I don't like to see about the effects of war and combat. Every single persons who were perished where were taken into account and their names were engraved on the wall. Well done."
229,4.0,Very impressive facility. Outside are displays of aircraft and tanks and more. Inside is a beautiful museum consisting of three floors displaying history of all wars korea has had to fight through dating back to pre dynasty up to present.
230,4.0,"This is not like any other museums/ memorials. This one is nicely done up, carries you through the whole journey from the 3 kingdoms all the way to the U.N. involvement. Simply more than graphics on the wall, it is interactive and done up in a way that it's as if you have turned back time and relieved those historical moments. Some goosebumps moments as well, there's even a 4D cinema to allow you to experience how it is like to be in a war zone! We spent a good 3 hours there. Recommended for last day of travel, it is quite a distance from central Seoul, so plan your itinerary for this and head to Gyeongbokgung area for the Korean Ginseng chicken! And a few stops away from Hongdae station for the shopping streets!"
231,5.0,"Loved this place!! Totally worth going to see, even if you aren't a History buff!! I had such a great time looking at all the warplanes, ships and tanks. It's great that you can actually go inside the tanks and aboard the ship!! was such a fun afternoon activity!! The memorial also is filled with cool information about the war - some of which i never knew before.  Honestly - go see and experience it!"
232,5.0,"not only for boys, huge museum with great exterior exhibit and nice view, definitelly worth a visit, save at least 3 hours"
233,4.0,"Huge area showcasing the war history of Korea. Our group stopped by after we paid for our DMZ tour at Koridoor Tours. Did not go inside (it was Monday and it seemed empty) because we didn't want to spend money but there was plenty to see outside. Huge statues and there were old planes, tanks, etc. a beautifully designed memorial. Recommend stopping by for half an hour if you're in the area."
234,5.0,One of the best put museums I have even been to. With story telling exhibits. Numerous historical documents. Allow at least 3 hours to go through it. It is well worth it. It is also free of charge.
235,5.0,"Must watch for any war enthusiast and kids... What a museum. The planes, tanks and artillery  kept outside is unbelievable. Must watch if you visit Seoul. Keep 4-5hrs spare time for this."
236,5.0,"A poignant reminder of the war that affected the Korean Peninsula almost 70 years ago.  A sad sight to see the statues of brothers fighting brothers on different sides.  The War Memorial's exhibits are very well done, informative about both sides in the Korean War and kids love the model US and NORK military hardware outside.  You can even go inside one of the USAF planes.   Best to go on a sunny day."
237,5.0,Entrance is free. it has outside area where all types of tanks and planes used in Korean wars are presentd. inside area is devided into wings for different war periods of korean history. worth a visit
238,5.0,This is the place to go if you want to know about the Korean War. I was amazed by this place it was incredible!! It is a MUST see attraction.
239,5.0,"This museum is all about the wars happened in Korea and the wars that koreans attended. I saw some people criticized about this museum making beautification of some wars like vietnam war but people should remind this museum is not about glory of korea but abt wars of korean which means we don't need to make beautification but need the truth. Moreover, this museum is not about world wide war but korean's so surely it's based on korean's point of view. Every war museum has the story of their country so if the logic goes on the people who say this museum has a problem ,which i announced at first, then which war museum could have the rights to open their museum!P.s. i've been visited this museum 3 times. Actually when i first visited here i didn't expected a lot but there's  some things that i can try and experience, can watch some short videos about war/army so much more exciting then i thought. Worth visiting."
240,4.0,Its takes us to olden days and explains everything thing about wars between south korea and north korea. Displayed tons of weapons there whice were used in war. Explains how other countries support South Korea.
241,5.0,"Located right around 3 minutes by walk from Samgakji Station, this place is in a great location. First, you will be welcome by a couple of statues that commemorates heroes from the Korean War, later on you enter the museum and have the choice to start at either first floor or on the basement. If you would like to focus on the Korean War, start on the first floor, but if the Joseon Dynasty is your choice go to the basement.After seeing the entire indoor exhibition, go to the East side of the museum to see all the military aircrafts in exhibition, which in fact was my favorite part.The War Memorial is free of charge, so you can stop by whenever you want during business hours. JUST MAKE SURE, ITS CLOSED ON MONDAYS!Make sure to give yourself a couple hours to look around the Memorial, so arrive around 3 pm as it closes at 5 pmIf you are a History maniac like myself, you shall definitely go here while you are in Seoul."
242,5.0,Great museum with a lot to see.  They had videos in English and Korean.  The planes and size of the place is surprising.  Will take some time to see it all.
243,5.0,"Worth the trip to this museum. It's very well done and it's free. We learned a lot about Korea and the Korean War-- it was really cool to see all the countries that came together to help South Korea. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip. If it's rainy or too cold to travel outside, come to this museum. You will not regret it!"
244,5.0,"This is hands down one of the best museums I've ever been to. You start out with a bang wandering through real military planes, ships, tanks, guns and rockets on display outside, as well as a moving statue dedicated to the victims of the Korean War. Inside, the museum offers everything you can imagine, from 4D movies, to informative slideshows and displays. I am a sucker for early 20th century military history, and this museum delivered. The content was presented in a tasteful, informative, interactive, but also reverent manner. I came away from my seven hour visit truly understanding the impact the Korean War had on this country."
245,5.0,"This is a great museum that highlights Korea's history. It is definitely worth a visit if you come to the city. Outside the museum are various army vehicles, helicopters, tanks, jeeps etc. Some of the vehicles you can climb on and go in. It makes for a great interactive experience."
246,4.0,"The War Memorial is very meaningful and interesting to see with both indoor and outdoor facilities - sculptures and venue to see, read about and learn about. The place is quite big, so I would recommend at least 2 hours in order to be able to fully enjoy and sightsee properly. It is near Itaewon shopping Center and not too far from Yongsan Station and also National Museum of Korea if one is interested in joining various places of interest in one day."
247,4.0,"It's sad the fact that the most important museum of a sity is the war museum. The history is still live over there, the wounds have not been healed and the tears have not been dried. Furthermore, the fear for more wounds and tears still exists... The fealings, after visiting this museum are not good: sorrow and sympathy for this suffering and divided people. However, it is, indeed, a must, when you are visiting Seoul."
248,5.0,"This place is free to enter but donations are welcomed, which go towards the upkeep of the museum. For those who like history, this place is really cool. It's got lots of planes, cars, tanks, artillery and other artifacts from the Korean war and lots of history on the other countries who helped to fight alongside the South Koreans."
249,4.0,"If you like to understand modern Korea and the influence of the Korean War in the general landscape of the peninsula, a trip to this museum is a must. Good layout and it has as well other great exhibitions about military elements of Korean history"
250,5.0,"The place is more of a museum than a war memorial a great view of Namsan tower and you can see the old aircrafts, naval ships and tanks. and offcourse there's North Korean's first prime minister's car too (which is cool and look luxurious too)"
251,5.0,This war memorial is one of my favorites!  The detail of the statues was amazing and the old airplanes add to the atmosphere.
252,5.0,"wen with couple of friends to this museum, you can find there weapon and army exhibits from the history of Korea, start at the Ancient time until modern warfare.you can see amazing weaponry, ships, airplanes, Vehicles and weapons.the exhibits are very nice and informative and you can learn a lot about the history of Korea from it starting from the ancient fights with the chines and Japanese until the Korean war and modern time.there is also nice memorial exhibits by various artists.at the end of the route you can find  Large plot with tanks ships and jet planes that you can take picture in or next to it."
253,5.0,"The War Memorial was built to commemorate participant and victims of the wars which led to the modern nation state. The museum also has the purpose of educating future generations by collecting, preserving, and exhibiting various historical relics and records related to the many wars fought in the country from a South Korean perspective."

258,5.0,"This place is fantastic, I could have spent all day here if I had the time. There is so much to see and learn here. You really get a sense of what was used during the war and what soldiers went through. Inside the museum part of the memorial, there is loads to see as well. Well worth the visit!!"
259,5.0,"Free.  Good static displays outside and inside, including a turtle boat.  Wheelchair accessible and family friendly.  Sometimes there are performances by military drill teams (usually around South Korean holidays like Armed Forces Day, etc.)."
260,5.0,"Wow, this place is fantastic.  Many details of the war and excellent descriptions.  Although the war was sad, as all wars are, there is a warmth and depth of emotion present in the museum that brought tears to my eyes.   I am an American, and I can't count the number of times Koreans thanked me for our involvement and help. They are truly grateful for all of the nations who participated.  Kind, friendly people."
261,5.0,THIS IS AN AWESOME PLACE! I learned a lot and it's very educational and the war museum conveys me how terrible the past was. It is so huge and I so love the place! I'll visit it again next time.
262,4.0,"well documented museum on the 1950s Korea War: a must view for those who share passion for history. the park aslo hosts an impressive number of military equipments, from planes to tanks, to vassels. worth spending a couple of hours or more"
263,5.0,"This is a great rainy or snowy day activity.  There is plenty to do and see.  The exhibits are funny, engaging, and educational.  There is several static displays outside to see and touch.  As must see in Seoul."
264,5.0,"A trip to The War Memorial of Korea is like experiencing what's like to be during the war. We saw several well-preserved war memorabilia like pictures, documents, flags, actual war footage and others. What's interesting there is they used high-tech audio visuals and life-sized dioramas. There are very interesting 3D film viewings that made us feel as if we're a part of it. This war memorial museum also acknowledges the countries that helped Korea during the war. One is the Philippines. There's a flag and other memorabilia pertaining to the Philippines that made us proud as a Filipino. Outside the museum is an exhibit of several warplanes, a warship and other war tanks where we freely took our pictures. The center of attraction is the War Memorial monument outside. There are human steel structures depicting the war. Very interesting and educational as well. Parking is not a problem and there is no entrance fee."
265,4.0,Definitely a must go especially if you want to learn more about the history between the North and South.
266,4.0,"I visited the Museum on a beautiful morning, learned a lot about Korean war and as a Chinese, heard stories from the other side. Respect to Korean people"
267,5.0,"It opens from 0900 to 1800 (last admission is 1700). I took the subway to Namyeong station and walked for 5 mins to reach the memorial.The place is quite huge and you can easily spend 2-3 hours here. There's an outdoor exhibition that showcases different kinds of military vehicles such as fighter jets and even a ship.Inside the building (after the Peace Plaza), there are a few floors of exhibitions. Definitely a place worth going if you have any kind of interest at all in history/war."
268,5.0,"I currently living in Hong Kong and must say that there are a lot of similarities between HK and Seoul. The War Memorial however is a slice of something very special. Apart from all the military vehicles which I spend hours checking out and the monuments and history texts, this place can easily be a days trip if you are into this stuff. I just went there because it was highly recommended on TripAdvisor but I ended up staying a lot longer than I thought."
269,5.0,"The War Memorial is unforgettable. You will need at least 4 hours to have a good view of all areas. It is not only about the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 1953, but also about almost two thousand of Korean History, such as the period of Three Kingdoms and Joseon Dynasty (from 1392 to 1910)."
270,4.0,This place is full of Korean history. Good for knowledge especially for those who wants to know a lot about Korean War
271,5.0,"my friends and i came across a 'statue of brothers' in one of the souvenir stores at the DMZ and googled to find out more about the background. it brought us to the War Memorial of Korea and i must say it's a great choice we made to visit it the next day!i'm not sure if it's a permanent exhibition, we visited end Oct and outside, there were airplanes, warships and tanks' model replicas on display. you can view a 7 min show depicting the confrontation between South and North in Year 2002, resulting in the death of 6 South Korean officers. the show only starts with minimum audience of 5, but the lady staff was kind to let us view it, even though we were only 3. if you watched it, you can better understand the exhibitions held in the war memorial building.there is a shooting simulation game in the Korean history exhibition. if there are students around, you may get a chance to try it. (my friends did, with a bunch of school students. i tried later on, but the staff rejected me and pointed to the 'students only' signboard)inside, you can view a 3D clip too. initially, they refused to start the clip as i was the only one waiting there. but to my surprise they allow a caucasian couple to enter. so unless you are caucasian or you can speak conversational korean, you probably will be ignored. i followed the couple in, and a male staff wearing a suit (manager, maybe) went to call for other visitors around (a korean elderly tour group) to join in. was told to fasten our seatbelts so we thought it's those 4D shows where your chairs can rock. but to our disappointment, nothing happened. the 3D clip was just a pilot's view on a fighter jet. NOT WORTH VIEWINGhowever there are many interactive screens and many well-made replicas of various incidents and information on South Korea's involvement in the World's war assistance.very educationalthere's a cafe in the war memorial building. serve desserts and waffles. the souvenir shop sells similar items to those sold in DMZ. if you are into history, this is the place for you."
272,5.0,"The war memorial was definitely a pleasant surprise. The building is massive with a neat architecture and you are sure to spend at least 3 hours to get through it all. You will be sure to learn a lot bout the war history by watching movies, viewing displays, several bronze statues, and miniature models. The highlight was definitely the outside display of several of war tanks, planes, ships, etc..."
273,4.0,It is a museum for the Korean war. Here you can enjoy the history of that war and the countries participated in that war. It worth the visit but it is in a central crowded area in Seoul. So you should consider the traffic jam when going there. 3-4 hours are the minimum to cover all.
274,5.0,"This museum was build to commemorate the Korean War. Some of it was being renovated when we were there. 1 thing to remember, CLOSED ON MONDAY. Must visit place to learn the most important part of Korea."
275,4.0,"The War Memorial of Korea is a very interesting place. It a couple of blocks from the Samgakji Station. It's one stop away from the National Museum and 1 or 2 from Itaewon station. There is a large outdoor area with numerous outdoor exhibits that leads into the main building. You could probably spend most of an afternoon here if not all day. Many exhibits are interactive and interesting for children, although it's always about death and war. You'll have to decide whether you want your kids to see it. Outside by the foot of the stairway in front of the main building there are vending machines, if you want more you'll have to walk out a bit. I recommend bringing drinks and snacks. On the right of the building outdoors there are war vehicles. Behind that is the children's museum. I'm assuming there are more interactive things for kids as I've never been in there."
276,5.0,It's much better than I expected. Never thought that this museum is real good. Learnt a lot of things about war in Korea with various ways they offered. Wasn't bored at all during my visit.
277,4.0,"There are actual plane , tank, machine guns there . You can spend around 1 to 2 hours there . The place will show you their gratification to those who fought with them in war."
278,5.0,I love this place. it's quiet yet historical. The place will show you the military power of South Korea plus their gratification to those who fought with them in war.
279,5.0,I have been here about 4 times and I love the exhibits. Summarises the history of Korea nicely that has never been at peace with all the fighting. The exihibits are fairly new and the outdoor exihibit with real tankers and fighter jets are really cool. Really recommend this attraction to anyone who wants to learn more about the history of Korea!
280,5.0,"I was surprised at just how good this museum actually was. I've been to war museums in the past and I've been impressed but nothing like this. Extremely user friendly, by that, I mean it caters to all languages. Don't miss the short videos on the 3rd floor. Each video has its only little pod and only last a few minutes, definitely worth stopping for!"
281,5.0,You'll need more than one hour to appreciate the attention to details. Prior to my visit I was ignorant of all the countries involved and te number of lives affected
282,5.0,"We went on a weekday and there were very few people. The attraction is free and the staff are helpful. I have read a little about the Korean War and there was not a lot of new information, but most exhibits are translated and came from a vantage point that gave a different insight. The is also a good range of displays, objects, projections and areas built to look like a kind of tunnel and valley. I liked the memorial areas them selves, for some this may feel empty but I felt that was part of the experience and quite moving.  We went after a DMZ tour and I felt that they worked well together. A lot of day DMZ tour will take you here in the afternoon, however I did not feel that we needed a tour guide as the man at the desk gave us a map and had a lot of knowledge about the museum. It is also free so I would advise going by yourself and not paying extra to go as part of a DMZ tour."
283,4.0,"Nice on the outside, not so much on the inside. I know its supposed to be like a museum and that it shouldnt exactly be ""nice"", which it should be educational rather. but in my opinion, i felt that the interior of this place is somewhat below what i was expecting and it could have been ""nicer"", perhaps i was taking into comparison with the other museums that i've been to. the information given here is also not align with what was shown at the DMZ 3rd Tunnel. but all in all, if you're into the history and especially of the korean peninsula, this place is not to be missed."
284,4.0,In this huge city of Seoul history does not seem to necessarily be a prevailing theme but this is the place to visit for a lesson in 20th century Korean history. This attraction is free. You can see many Korean War artifacts and displays. Beautiful monument with large sculptures visible from the street.
285,5.0,"If u are fan to war technologies like tanks or aircraft, u will love it. The entrance is for free. Lots of interesting stuff inside the museum like 4D cinema about North/South Korean war."
286,4.0,This is a great  memorial to see and it is free to go visit. If you are into military  history and military vehicles then you can't  go wromg with this place.  It is a good trip to go see if you have a couple  of hours  to spare.
287,4.0,"The war memorial is quite large and extensive, with an impressive amount of displays and information! It is well maintained, and it's obvious that a lot of time and effort has been put into it. I'll definitely be going back, as we didn't get the chance to do it all in one visit. Free guided english tour offered every day at 2PM. The tour quickly walks you through the Korean War and the guide seemed really excited about the topic, which is always nice. Lasted about an hour, but there was so much info we felt like we were speeding through it!"
288,5.0,"Wow, the displays are superb and the role of honour is a wonderful memorial. A place of quiet reflection."
289,4.0,I was not too keen on visiting a war memorial but what an experience. The huge statues were the first things to blow us away! Then there was the 4-D mini cinemas which brought the war which caused so much suffering to the people of SK. The huge murals and audio screens around every corner and on the way out the life-size war planes. The whole place had an air of solemnly about it and you left it knowing much more about the history of the country than when you entered. Should definitely be high on the list when visiting.
290,5.0,"Lots of interesting history items and exhibits featured inside to see. Outside without entrance are lots of planes, tanks, guns to view and touch."
291,3.0,"A very informative visit to refresh the North and South Korean War. Lots of things to see, there are videos, exhibits and bilingual guides to explain what you don't quite remember. If you are near, go for it."
292,4.0,"Three large rooms describe the Korean War (north/south). Lots to see, with interactive displays and 4D video presentations. At times too many document displayed. There is some propaganda going on here, but a good primer on the war. Lots of emphasis on U.S. involvement, but less on UN involvement (this is mostly on second floor in 3rd room that does not get a lot of visitors.)"
293,5.0,"Due to a very busy itinerary only visited this place for a few hours, however could have easily spent a whole day here.This museum is free to enter and offers a fantastic eye opening insight into the Korean war.Static displays, photos, memorabilia along with film shows and 4D film shows along with a vast display of military equipment outside.Incredible place!"
294,4.0,This place is so big than i expectedI could see many information about korean war it was so informative to me
