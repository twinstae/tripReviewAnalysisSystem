0,1.0,I ordered beef rice noodle(pho) and shrimp fried rice. It was such a terrible experience. Both food were blend especially the noodle. The fried rice had no seasoning. I will never go back.
1,2.0,"Spent a couple of hours at this mall today. Great shopping, plenty of choice: in-store brunch, coffee & cake, clothes, cosmetics, electronic, pretty much all high-end, etc.... yet when it comes to paying there is an issue: overseas cards are an issue and barely accepted. Visa and Master Cards limited to KRW 200K.  Think you can solve it by taking cash from the KEB ATM onsite ? Sorry, none of the 3 overseas cards (Master / Visa / Union Pay) were accepted.... so, if you are an overseas visitor and plan on going for some retail therapy, be prepared and bring the cash !"
2,3.0,"Hyundai department store is a multi-level high-end department store with its own metro stop and dedicated food court with separate interior restaurants. All of the food on display looks really good but isn't cheap. We ate lunch in one of the associated restaurants. Worth a browse on a hot or cold day to get out of the weather, but not necessarily a must-see."
3,5.0,This is Seoul's equivalent of the food hall in Harrods. Possibly even better - because here you can actually afford to buy the wonderful produce and creations on display. It's extremely popular with the locals. Great variety and great displays. There is a whole department store upstairs as well by the way - but the food hall is going to make your day
4,5.0,"Great shopping all round - especially recommend to have a look at a Korean clothing brand called TIME, beautiful and creative clothing for women and men.Food Court is also a ""must see"". Dare to try some local fare - easy to order, easy to love. Cold Noodle Soup (Mul NaengMyang), Fish Cake, Topoggi, Jajang Myang and Tangsuyuk, the excellent Sweet & Sour Pork are my favorites."
