You definitely need good hiking shoes and walking sticks will also be a great help. Don't forget to bring food and water. You can fill your water in streams on some of the trails. Toilets are few, far and minimal. Its something different to do in Seoul if you are fit for the climb."
1,5.0,"Really easy to get to by public bus.ButIt’s serious hiking.We did a 2.5 hour one way which was uphill and over rock trails the whole way. All the locals are in hiking shoes and using hiking poles.We hoped to get away with casual shoes, but after 5 Kms taking almost 5 hours, you get a sense that it’s steep up and down. Ours was deemed one of the easier walks and classified intermediate. Would not take children or anyone with health problems.Great views, helped the aching legs.Would also mention that despite some good signage, there are many times when the path seems to have multiple options with no sign. We got lost once and discovered that many locals go off the trail on their own to find somewhere quiet. There are many options for this and so it can be hard to know what is and isn’t a trail"
2,5.0,"What a place it is truly wonderful, the views are outstanding. make sure that you stop and drink everything in."
3,5.0,"if you want to take an excellent view of Seoul, take the challenge and climb all the way up. Follow the correct trail to get to the Baegundae peak which stands at 840m above sea level. Equip yourself with hiking gear if you want to head all the way up as there are slippery slopes near the top. Dint make it all the way up as i did not wear the correct shoes. there is no stones or steps to head to the peak when you are near 20m away."
4,5.0,"Bukhansan National Park is in the middle of town and with the exception of one other group, the trail to the temples was empty on a mid-Monday morning; an unexpected treat. The forest was blooming and our walk was the perfect break from the city bustle. We would have never found the trailhead without a guide but otherwise the trails are well traveled and well marked."
5,5.0,"amazing oppertunity close to seoul city center; if u like to hike korea is a paradis for u. From easy paved walks to more forcing tracks to challenging tours u will find everything. Korea national parks tracks are best marked and maintaned. Even u will find toilets, fitness stations, guard ropes, stairs, ... Don't expect stations where u can buy drinks or food. U shoud bring by your own."
6,5.0,"This place is located just outside Seoul and can be reached via an hour public bus ride from Central bus station. The park is well marked and hiking up the various peaks are well directed.The hike up and down is not easy with medium level of difficulty. Certain areas are accessible with the help of ropes or chains.There are many streams and floral scenes along the way.The view on top , at about 1000 m above sea level, is awesome with a good 360 degree view of the surroundings and distant view of Seoul."
7,5.0,"Bukhansan national park can be reached by taking subway line 3 to Gupabal Station. If you get out at Exit 1, you can take bus 704 to Bukhansanseoun Fortress. The main peak is called Baegundae peak which takes quite a bit of effort to get toWe came during low season in the middle of winter (it was -14 degrees celcius at the time!). Although it was super cold, there were still quite a lot of hikers during the day. We recommend bringing ample food and drink on the way up as you will struggle otherwise. Whilst it was the dead of winter we did not encounter snow on the day, and i think were there snow, this hike would have been a lot harder. There are many intermediate and beginnner paths, but to get to the main peak, you will need to walk through difficult and what looks quite extreme for the average walker. I do quite a lot of hikes during my holidays but the final 30m or so is no piece of cake. There are metal cables attached to metal poles in the mountain side and parts of it requires all your strength to get up. During the peak season, i assume you may need to wait around to get up as you will have hordes of tourists trying to come the opposite direction. You may be greeted by families of mountain cats at the topBe prepared for extreme wind up there!One tip we learned was to make sure you have ample time to come down. It took a bit longer to descend due to the steepness and if you descent the way you came up, you will catch the afternoon sun. Make sure you reach the paved path before nightfall as there is very little light pollution on the mountain paths and you will struggle if it is pitch black!"
8,5.0,You can buy hiking sticks for USD5 on the way to the entrance & I highly recommend you do.National parks in Korea are not for the faint hearted! We only did the very short walk to the closest view point because we’ve been hiking at Busan & Gyeongju & also only allocated a couple of hours here. It takes 1hr by train from Seoul to get here.
9,5.0,"Amazing views and excellent work out. Things I'm glad we brought up the mountain: water, snacks, good hiking shoes, winter hat because it gets very windy, walking stick and gloves. For the gloves, you don't necessarily need them for warmth but to pull yourself up, using the steel ropes. I've read that people have gotten blisters and the gloves really helped. Be prepared for some very slippery, flat rocks. We took the city bus there and had no issues. Highly recommend this for anyone visiting Seoul!"
10,5.0,"I got to Bukhansan National Park from the metro and hopped on a bus to the park entrance. My goal was to make it to the top of Baegundae (Peak), boy it was not an easy hike! I am fit and hike a lot and absolutely enjoyed every minute of the thrill getting to the top. The views were absolutely stunning, and some of the historical markers along the trail were fascinating. There were a few spots where I accidentally left the trail, signage was rare in some spots. Toward the top, it gets very rocky but there are cables to hang on to. Once at the top, you can see the whole city and surrounding area. Bonus, there are a few friendly kitties at the top that can't wait to get their photos taken! The views and experience was well worth the effort to the top. There are several trails near the entrance but to reach the peak, I would not recommend it for kids or others that are not physically fit, just being honest. I was here in October, I hit the fall leaves at the perfect time. Bukhansan National Park was my highlight of Seoul, superb experience!"
11,4.0,"Just 25 min by subway from heart of Seoul. To take to the top of Baekundae it will take about 3,5 h (up only). After hiking there are some nice local restaurants near subway to enjoy Korean barbecue."
12,5.0,"We had a fantastic day hiking in Bukhansan National Park. We loved the convenience of being able to get the metro to a national park, it's so accessible! The park is beautiful and it's full of locals out hiking, making the most of the gorgeous park. We went on a weekday in Autumn when the leaves were changing colour and it was a little crowded, but not too crowded."
13,5.0,This is a beautiful hike with moderate challenge. The view is just magnificent and and the trail is also clean. There were mostly koreans and they were super fit. I hike twice a week and even I found it moderately challenging.
14,5.0,"if u want to do something a little different u must go here, theres different routes depending on your experience and level of fitness and the views are outstanding all the way up i couldnt recommend it enough. dont worry about food and drinks when u get to the start of the mountain range theres loads of shops to get everyhing from snacks drinks to hiking gear. but make sure you wear proper hiking shoes and take a bag with standard hiking equipment as this is a proper mountain range and you dont want to get caught out"
15,5.0,"Fantastic views with some strenuous bits. Mainly I the forest until you reach the mountain where you need to do some climbing. Take a hoodie for the top it gets cold.Metro is 30min walk away from the start of the walk. It always go up.For the way back take a different route going around the mountain. Take Maps.me with you because the park indications are quite bad, it will stop showing your main route after a while. Pay attention some names sounds the same but are totally different."
16,5.0,"The stunning view from the top of Baegundae is indeed worth the long hike! The hike takes approx. 5 hours, from the very bottom to the top and back, including stop at the temple. Bring plenty of water and good shoes!"
17,5.0,"We chose BUKHANSANSUNG course and it took us roughly 5 hours to complete the hike (round trip). Do bring food and plenty of water as there is no food/water once you start the hike. Also bring along mosquito repellant as there are many mosquitos at the foot of the mountain. The last part of the hike to the peak was very challenging due to the steepness and we had to climb up via the ropes. Thankfully, we read some of the reviews that the ropes can be quite painful and brought anti-slip gloves (we bought a cheap one from Daiso costing 1000 won for 2 pairs). We ate kimbap at the peak while enjoying the stunning view. Recommend!"
18,5.0,"Absolutely amazing views. We went on a Monday, since other landmarks tend to be closed this day. Though the hike was by no mean easy (and I hike regularly!) the views at the top were amazing. To get the full view, you'll need to go on a clear sunny day. But make sure to bring plenty of water, as it gets quite hot and the hikes are not casual. Some of the paths have vending machines / stalls selling water and the entrance has many sporting goods stores and cafes to help you prepare for your hike, or recover afterwards."
19,5.0,"Awesome hiking experience to the top of the Bukhasan mountain which is 832 meters altitude. Took around 2 hours from the small village before the entrance to the national park. we took the expert gradient route, which has an average ascent steepness of around 25 degrees but at time it felt more like 50%. Hike down took around one hour maximum. Although very hot and sweaty to climb up, have a warm pullover for the top as it is rather cool up there."
20,5.0,"* Nice hike up highest peak in the Seoul area - Beagundae 836m* Top section involves scrambling on rock with fixed cables for security, some may find scary, others may find easy* Round trip took up about 5 hours, including 1/2 hour at summit* See attached image for GPS track, we came down a longer and perhaps more interesting and less used route. All the tracks are pretty well marked and you can get a map (we paid 1000) at the park information office.* No fee or permits required to hike (unlike Taiwan)* Loads of gear shops near at the start of the route, and a few places where you can buy drinks and snacks * We used bus number 704 to get there from city (every 12 mins, about 1200 won each way, use a TMoney card)"
21,5.0,"The park is a nice trip out of the hustle of Seoul but gets busy as well. We hiked to the top of Baegundae on a nice sunday morning and while probably every senior citizen of Seoul was hiking at the same time, the crowds were not a big issue. Only for the last 300m  which are narrow and steep whilst you have to hold on to chains and ropes, there was a lot of traffic. We took the one of the less traveled routes down. The park is easy to hike since there are signs and well connected to public transport."
22,5.0,"Expect some exercise with this venture into the park!Very popular with locals on a weekend, all decked out in their active wear and hiking poles.The first hour has a paved path that will take you up past a number of temples, and their are other tracks of varying difficulty as well. Very pleasant experience, with babbling brooks and other natural beauty.You can then venture up further to the ... wall or if you are really brave, up to the one of the peaks.Once the paved path ends, the path gets a lot more ambiguous, for example 15min before the shelter on the way to the Begondae peak the paths non existent and you are just walking through trees. Thankfully there should be a big enough stream of locals to follow. Tracks and stairs do eventually come back though.We decided to go to the Begondae peak and around 1km to go (approx 700m altitude) things start getting pretty hairy. My husband tapped out around this time when we got to the point where only a steel pole and cable was between you and a sheer 100m+ drop. The space also gets quite limited around here as people are traversing in both directions. That said, there were plenty of locals in their 60s and active wear with apparently no fear plodding their way up towards the peak. Even at this point, the view across Seoul was amazing.All in all a great experience, albeit a little hairier than we expected. You have been warned!"
23,5.0,"If you want to get out of the sparkling city of Seoul to feel some fresh air and the nature around you, Bukhansan is probably the fastest way as it's literally right next to the city."
24,5.0,My husband and I love to hike and were glad that we kicked started our Seoul trip by hiking this mountain.  We loved every minute of it and wish we could spend more time here.The views here are incredible from picturesque streams to gorgeous blossoms.  We can't wait to come back here again on our future trips to Seoul.
25,5.0,"As we get used to hike a mountain in Hong Kong, this time around we wanted to try hiking in Seoul and we found Bukhansan as it is quite close to Seoul. It takes us about 35-40mins by bus from Hansung University area. Our starting point was Bukhansanseong up to Baegundae peak, the highest in Bukhansan and most well known. The first 1hour was pretty much fine , it was mostly flat path and stairs to go up and down. Then it started to change as we went up more and more, it was kinda tough as it took us to keep climb up the mountain and it has a rocky terrain. We spent about 3.5hrs to reach the peak with a bit of rest here and there. It is important to pack up your lunch and water as you can enjoy the view on the top while u have ur lunch. As we hiked in Spring time when the weather still pretty much milder, it will be more difficult during Summer time as the weather gonna be super hot and u may need more water. You may also need a hiking stick especial when you go down !!! Unfortunately, we didn't bring any as it was quite tough for my knee to keep going down without any helping tools. In total we spent about 5hrs from starting point to ending point (Bulgwang Station). Please note that is better to wear sport shoes as we saw some people wearing converse or Adidas Superstar which is not suitable at all for the terrain if u want to reach up the peak."
26,5.0,"Seoul is a highly underrated destination for hikers. There are lots of fantastic hikes of various grades with stunning views! Living in Seoul, I hike in both spring and fall. There are hundreds of different trails, ranging from easy to quite strenuous. On a clear day, you are treated to a mixture of city and mountain views. There are often bathrooms, exercise parks, badminton courts, benches, pavilions and more along the way. One trail even has complimentary bug spray. Another has hammocks (not Bukhansan National Park I don't think...it was a trail near Seodaemun). Seoul's hiking is one of my favorite things about the city, and not one that many people expect to find in this concrete jungle. However, it's very fast and easy to find yourself at the base of a hike from many parts of the city."
27,4.0,I decided to go on this adventure with my boyfriend and I didn't regret it. Since I come from a city surrounded by mountains I was quite impressed by the view. It is indeed easy to hike and it can be done by people of any age. What I loved the most were the Buddhist temples and the Fortress combined with the peaceful atmosphere.
28,4.0,"Hiking Bukhansan is not as easy as what was written here. I didn't know which track i took as i engaged a guide to bring me up. It was drizzling when we started and got abit heavier along the way. By the time i reached the peck, it was foggy and i couldn't see much. Only after the climb then i realized that July was their raining season. However, i still enjoyed the hike even though i didn't get to see the view at the peak. Overall, it was an enjoyable hike and i will definitely do it again."
29,5.0,"Whether its a visit for a full day trip or just a few hours, this place is great for unwinding and seeing beautiful nature and scenery."
30,5.0,"Yes, this is definitely a hike, but we saw people of all ages there hiking to the top so there is no reason not to. The views from the top make it worth it"
31,5.0,"It's not to far from Seoul, beautiful park with nice rock mountain where we can trek and enjoy the beautiful views around, take nice photo of the natures, mountains, forest.."
32,5.0,"Rain was expected, but skies were blue when we took the bus (704) from Gupabal Metro station (line 3) to the Bukhansanseong entrance. The start was both nice - a lovely creek running next to the trail - and easy, but it soon became steeper and steeper. Actually, it was more like a staircase than a trail in many parts. The last stretch to the peak (Baekundae) was both crowded and steep and the wire ""handrails"" were necessary for both ascent and descent.At the top, skies were grey, but the 360 view with equal parts of rugged wilderness and metropolitan Seoul was even more breathtaking than the trail.We had some few drops of rain on the way down - heading for the eastern exit in Ui-dong - but as the trail is made almost entirely of stone and rock, there was no risk for muddy conditions, though there might be some slippery slopes in case of heavier rainfall. We had only jogging shoes, but it is probably better and safer to wear shoes with harder soles.At the eastern side the autemn colours were stronger, especially the maples (Acer palmatum?) but in total less than one would expect in early October.The signs on the trails were partly in English and the risk of getting lost was minimal as there was a constant stream of hikers. Suprisingly, all trails were neatly included in the of-line map in the app ""maps.me"". Highly recommended.Our trip took us around five hours, including quite a number of stops, and was the highlight of our stay in Seoul!"
33,5.0,We enjoyed hiking up here followed by an afternoon in a Korean spa. We would rate the hike as moderate difficulty. We went with a guide for ease but it could be done without one too.
34,5.0,Loved this hike but be ready. I'm 47 and this hike was tougher than I expected. We picked up Kimbap at the food stand right off the subway (line 3) and had a picnic on the mountain. Really enjoyed this hike but I was sore the next day.
35,5.0,"This hike was not easy but it was definitely worth it. We went on a weekday and it wasn't too busy but there were still many people. We took the bus 704 from Gupabal station to the entrance and the hike to the top took about 2 hrs (with breaks). We saw a cat and a kitten at the peak and a dog on the way. The peak is beautiful and there are tons of areas to sit and rest/enjoy the view. If we go back, we'll definitely pack a lunch and have lunch at the top! We took a different way down (opposite of the way we came up) and that wasn't as nice as the way up. Definitely worth the day trip if you have time :)"
36,5.0,We took the train to Dobongsan station and walked 10-15mins to the park entrance. The ranger counter was just opened when we arrived at 8.20am. There are maps available. The level of difficulty is shown by the route (different from what is on their website). There were many solo hikers and elderly climbing too. We found some parts (especially towards the peak) quite challenging but still manageable as there are rails to hold on too. Took 4.5 hours to and fro. We went in August and weather was hot. Good hiking shoes and plenty of water!
37,5.0,If you want to hike to the peaks take the subway line 3 and exit Gupabal. Take then line 704 to Bukhansan National Park information center or just follow the hikers. If you want to return to the subway station take bus number 8772. Bring some snacks and enough water or drinks with you. The sight is very beautiful at the peaks and you can also visit some temple's.
38,5.0,"How to get there: Take the subway to Gupabal Station. Love the station at exit 1. Get on the 704 bus and get off at Bukhansan bus stop.There are numerous great hikes in the park. And some of the hikes are for advanced people, because it is more like climbing rocks. We went to Yonghyeobong and Uisanbong and these trails are quite hard. Many people set off to Beagundae, but I could recommend doing this when the weather is clear so you can look far away. The mountains that I mention above are very nice and I would certainly recommend them if you want a nice adventure. Enjoy!"
39,5.0,"The Bukhansan National Park was on our bucket list for the visit in Seoul, and we were very happy we got to do it. It was a hot morning in early June, and we brought about 4 litres of water and Gatorade for the hike. Not very crowded track, but be prepared for the steep hike and approximately 700 meters you have to go up. The scrambling at the top is not for the faint hearted, but feels very safe with steps chiseled into the granite, and ropes to hold on to. I was almost seven months pregnant at the time and managed to do the return trip in five hours. For some weird reason both our hotel and taxi drives seemed unaware of where we actually wanted to go for the hike, so we were almost dropped of at the complete wrong place. The taxi ride from Myeongdong to the park entrance was 40 000 won, while the return trip was 15 000. Go on a day with no rain, I would imagine the granite slabs at the top to be very scary and slippery in wet weather."
40,5.0,Brilliant national park with some advanced hiking to the top and across the plateau. Definitely a must if in Seoul.
41,5.0,"We took the most common trail to the highest peak (Baegundae). We went on a Monday and got to the park around 0730. At this time, there was barely anyone on the trail. So when we got to the top, there was only ever 3 other people at the top. We spent about 30 minutes at the top and on the way back (around 1130) we started seeing a lot more foot traffic. So come early and try to avoid the weekend/holidays.  Do not underestimate the trail, it is only 4.2km but it is very steep. Very challenging, and the view on a clear day is definitely worth it!"
42,5.0,"If you love hiking, don't miss. Take a bus to get there and enjoy yourself. It's best if you get a map of the trails before you get there as all they have are maps in Korean. However, everyone is very friendly and eager to help you. You might not be able to communicate, though. As a foreigner, you will feel perfectly fine and safe there."
43,5.0,"This is a large mountain range, popular with hikers. There are short and long routes with many peaks, but most of it is accessible for casual hikers. Some routes take you along valleys with streams, some go along ridges. There are tree covered and bare parts and the rock looks stunning in morning and evening light.There are quite a lot of small local restaurants on the small roads leading to the main trails, and these are perfect for a post-hike feast of pajeon and makgeolli.The map website run by Naver (search for it) will show you most of the routes. If in doubt,l just follow the people in hiking clothes."
44,5.0,"A metro and bus journey to get there from Seoul but well worth it. Beautiful, natural park, lovely scenery and an excellent hike if you want to make it top the top of the peak(s)"
45,5.0,"We left from downtown Seoul -- took the purple Line 5 train to Jongno-3 station and got on the orange heading towards Daewha. Got off at Gupabal station (use exit 2) and got on the 704 (or 34) bus. We went on a Sunday, so there were plenty of other hikers to watch and follow. Got off ~10 stops later at something that sounded like Bukhansan and followed the hikers into a small town (lots of hiking gear and food/drink). BRING A LOT OF WATER. If you're going up to the top, you need minimal one bottle per person, but 2 would be better. You can buy this in the little town. There are also a couple of bathrooms on the way up, make sure you use them while you can!To be honest I have no idea the route we took, we just kept following signs toward the peak. Took us ~2.5 hours to get up there and another 1.5 to get back down. If you've read some other reviews, you'll have seen people recommend gloves - it's because of the lines you have to use at the top -- we made it without gloves, but they sure would've been nice, especially with sweaty hands! Absolutely worth the effort, even on a hazy day like we had. Not sure it'd be possible to get to the top on a rainy/wet day, so plan ahead!"
46,5.0,"Great place with easy access from Seoul center. Baegundae peak with impressive view of the city is quite challenging. Final part you must go next to the ropes. Best place in Bukhansan is Golden Buddha, not very popular trail, only 40-50 minutes from the entrance of the park. Very calm and beautiful place."
47,5.0,Very close to downtown of Seoul. Great place for hiking. Some trails are very difficult. You have to be equipped before go.
48,5.0,"Lots of paths to take which could take you hours, days, and weeks. Make sure you have  some good shoes or walking stick because there are lots of potential chances of slipping"
49,5.0,I have hiked 3 different trails in this park area and each time have been inspired and amazed by the beautiful mountain views there. This is a great park to hike for people of any skill level.
50,5.0,I went there for an afternoon walk with my boyfriend on a Friday and there were barely any people around. It was incredibly peaceful and not that difficult a walk. We took the bus 143 from crown hotel near Itaewon to the end of the line travelling North. It drops you off very close to the National Park building with the information office in.
51,5.0,Great way to experience the outdoors when you visit Seoul. The views were great. You should not miss it
52,4.0,"You can hike the whole day there if you want. The way to the top is quite difficult. Koreans are very rude on the trail and stupid, they block the way and don't go away. You can visit several temples and Peaks."
53,5.0,"Great way to experience the outdoors when visiting Seoul. Dozens of well maintained trails with varying degrees of difficulty. Peaceful, with great views. On top of that, there are about 20 Buddhist temples throughout the mountain. Makes for a great day of hiking."
54,5.0,The trekking trails are well maintained.  Views were great.  Baegundae peak is quite challenging.  Need strong arms and legs for the last bit to the peak.
55,5.0,"If you are up to a hike then this is worth a visit.  I am sure you can get a tour that will drive you up the mountain but feel the true beauty of the mountain can be lost, we managed to see some wildlife on the hike up.  Make sure you dress appropriately, comfy shoes or hiking shoes are a must"
56,5.0,"We went to Gupakal station, took bus 34 or 704 and walked straight to information center. We saw long queue for the bus so we just followed. Many Korean come here for hiking on the weekend. It started off easy with proper road, on gravel road, & with easy rocky paths, challenging rocky paths & the final stretch looking like Mission Impossible scene.  The path we choose is only intermediate, but it is actually very advanced level for normal people like us.  So please come prepared with good hiking shoes &  gears.  If you are not sure what to get, you can refer to the Koreans outfit & gears which you can get around the information center.It took us at least 3 hours on the way up for the 4.2km to Baekundae Peak. We had to turn back with only 300m to the peak as it looks too dangerous without the hiking gears.  We had lots of respect for the grandpa & grandma who hike so swiftly & jumping from rocks to rocks! The way down is a lot shorter as we dont need to stop & catch our breath. Despite all the challenges, this place is worth a visit but please get ready your gears, bring drinking waters & at least a Snicker Bar as you will be famish when you are at the top, especially when you see the Korean Grandpa & Gramma come prepared with Hot Cup Noodles or drink & a tiny stool."
57,4.0,"Being seniors, we were a little concerned about visiting Bukhansan - not sure if we could cope with the walking trails. I can tell you now that it is definitely worth visiting. After visiting the lovely Gyeogbokgung, we took the line 3 metro to Gupabal station. Outside the station, jump on to bus no.704 and that took us to a stop just outside the Bukhansan National Park. It's a short walk into the entrance of the park where there is a ranger station. Speak to the lady at the window and she will show you an appropriate walking trail on a map. As it was late in the afternoon, she showed us a trail that will take 2 hours (end to end). The trail is most suitable for us as most of the track is bitumen and therefore easier on our feet. It was a delightful walk to the big Buddha temple in the midst of autumn colour."
58,5.0,It was certainly the best place around Seoul during my trip. Its good to choose autumn months (not that hot like summer and cold like winter and beautifull colors on the trees). Hiking is kind of national sport in Korea so expect many people especially during weekends and sunny weather. In my opinion is not that easy to hike so better have proper shoes and clothes (although its possible to do it in jeans and trainers it will not be a pleasant journey). There are many paths that you can choose but it may be not that easy to get there with public transportation. Views are breathtaking. You have to see it!!!
59,5.0,"We hiked on the most beautiful fall day. Weather was perfect with sun and a light breeze. We traveled on the subway then bus to the park, so worth it! We saw birds, squirrels, a couple friendly dogs and cats.  The hike was a great workout with the amazing gift of beautiful views at the top. Best birthday gift!"
60,4.0,"I've hiked some nice tall mountains in Quebec, Canada. But nothing compares to the hike that I've experience in Bukhansan National park.The view at the top is definitely worth seeing, but don't take it lightly as this needs good hiking boots!The area is easily accessible by metro followed by a ride in the bus. The time that we went, there were a bunch of people dressed for hiking, and they took the same bus as us. We weren't 100% sure where we were supposed to get off, but when they got off the bus, we got off as well!Careful at the top, it's so high and a tad bit crowded that you might feel like you're going to fly off the summit.*No entrance fee*"
61,5.0,"I was able to get to the entrance of the park using the subway station then taking a taxi to the entrance of the park. I went in 2015 and Google maps and Apple maps did not work in Korea. It will give you an idea of what train to take to your destination, but it will not show you where you are accurately. Despite this, they are still helpful and will point you in a the right direction. I would sched a full day for the trip. Despite the maps posted along the trail, we still got lost. We wanted to be able to go back the way we came, but ended up on the other side of the mountain. However, despite that, all the locals (who spoke a conversational amount of English) were so nice to us and helped us get on a taxi back to the train station. I felt like this was a moderate hike, but due to the distance, some may think it to be a bit more strenuous. A lot of the locals will bring trekking poles (although I do not think it's needed). I would dress in layers because the top of the mountain is fairly windy and cold, while the bottom can be warm. One thing I wish I did before going to the top, that a LOT of the locals did, was bring a cup of noodles and a hot thermostat of water to eat at the top. It looked so good and my stomach was jealous. I definitely think this hike is worth the work and was my favorite part of my trip to Seoul."
62,5.0,"Beautiful National Park on the outskirts of Seoul. Easy to get to, we took the metro line number 3 to Gupbal station, exit 1. Then took bus 704 to the entrance (just follow all the local hikers). We climbed up Baegundae peak one of the highest in the park. Started off easy but the route does get harder/steeper as you go on up. Think this peak is for advance hikers!Took us just over 3 hours to reach the top (we are novices) but we did stop for a picnic lunch half way up. Views at the top - stunning. You can buy a map for 1000 yen and the lady marks out the route and times for you.This national park is big. There are many different routes and entrances so do you research before you go and be prepared with fluids and food. At the Baegundae peak entrance there are many hiking shops and food stalls if you forget.In all had a lovely day in the fresh Korean air."
63,5.0,Went there by an accompanied coach tour. Amazing scenery with the mountain and the river specially when viewed from high up on the mountain that is accessible by cable car. Unfortunately did not spend enough time. There are lots of tracks for adventure. Should go there again and spend more time and may be stay a few days. The speciality at the restaurant is the stuffed quid which is very good. There is a huge statue of Buddha and a temple.
64,5.0,Went here a few days ago to explore. Was really beautiful. Plenty of restrooms spread around and tons of scenery. Make sure to wear something comfortable because you will want to see it all!
65,5.0,"Hiked to Bukhansan peak with my wife and in-laws who are Korean natives so cannot be much help on directions. However, please be prepared for this hike and don't make all foreigners look bad.Koreans do not seem to use switchbacks, and Bukhansan peak is about 2700 ft elevation, so yes, all the trails up are steep. Expect lots of stone or boardwalk steps, some bouldering too, all very steep.I have hiked multiple trails in the Smoky Mountains and other places in east TN, USA, and though Korean mountains remind me a lot of this environment, the Korean trails I have hiked are without exception steeper overall than trails back home.Considering this, our party was hiking at about 1 mile per hour on the way up, perhaps slightly faster going down. Plan your water and food requirements accordingly based on the length of the trail you choose. Even the shortest trail is likely to be a 2+ hour climb up. Could easily be an all day hike, so most hikers you will see packing a lunch, snacks and plenty of liquids.Wear sturdy shoes if you have them, though the hike can be done in tennis shoes if you are careful with foot placement.Finally, enjoy the magnificent views from the top - there is a reason this is so popular!"
66,4.0,"This is definitely the most exciting and challenging hike we have ever done so far. We went for the highest peak which is the baegundae peak. Perhaps we were too ambitious. We should have went for lower peaks rather than the highest.It started off easy but along the way it gets tougher and harder. We were actually on the right path until we reached this intersection where we did not know which way to go as there were no directions given. We saw a group of locals and we asked them for direction. However, according to them, we were taking a longer route to reach baegundae peak. They advised us to take a shorter route by asking us to follow them. We backtracked for about 45 min and finally reached the route which according to them supposed to be the shortest and fastest route to reach baegundae peak. However, they did not warn us that this route is for advanced climber and we are obviously not advanced climber.We followed the recommended route and soon the route gets really tough with steep rocks path where we have to literally climbed with our arms and pull ourselves up with the help of steel cables. My fiancee is definitely not up for this but she tried her best to do it. Even I find this route really tough. We feel like turning back halfway but we wanted to get to the peak. Each time we took a break along the way, we looked up and what we saw was just rock paths, nothing near to the peak. The climb seems forever. While taking breaks, we get to meet some locals and some offered us food and drinks. It's really nice of them. Finally, we reached the last checkpoint which says 300m to baegundae peak.The last 300m to the peak was the toughest and most dangerous route of the entire hike because the slope got really steep and slippery. Steel cables are available for support but it requires a lot of arm strength to pull ourselves up which my fiancee has difficulty of doing so. We endured till the last stretch of the route to the peak which was extremely steep which my fiancee is unable to continue. I can tell she was very scared and due to safety reason, we turned back down. Going down was not as simple as it sounds too as it seems like going down is even tougher than going up.Finally, we reached the baegundae info center and we were so relief that we made it down safely. At this point of time, we were extremely hungry and tired. We approached the info center staff and requested for her help to call for a taxi which came after 15 minutes. We went straight back to our hotel.Altogether, we hike for 7 hours, 4 hours up and 3 hours down. I read online that some people only took 4 or 5 hours up and down. We even missed our lunch. We only ate some snacks along the way. I regretted not bringing more food for this hike. We were slow but we completed the hike safely which is the most important thing.My advice is do not attempt to climb this mountain if you are a novice climber like us. This is definitely not for faint heart as well and please bring more food! Our last overseas hike was at Hong Kong's dragon's back which was so much easier than this. Dragon's back was like nothing compared to this. Please do more research and be more well prepared with mountain climbing gears if you really want to climb this mountain.Lastly, I gonna say the view from the top was simply breathtaking but it can be dangerous if one was to fall while climbing. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience which we will remember for the rest of our live. I am glad we made it up and down in one piece and I am really proud of my fiancee who has stepped out of her comfort zone for this hike. I know she was very scared at some points of the hike but she endured the entire hike without any complaint."
67,5.0,"We went down there on a Monday (all information desks were closed) so you just have to start walking. I think there are a lot of easier ways to get to the top (see pictures) but it was amazing. It took us about 2,5 hours to get to the top. only saw a few locals during the hike. Not one tourist we saw during the hike. ( we started from the main entrance, see picture) and just started to walk. if you are not able to climb rocks, get up and down by a rope don't go this way! but if you like some adventure....this trek is amazing!really loved it! and the views are amazing! No information in English during the hike, so you have to go by yourself (but follow the path and you will be fine)"
68,5.0,"This park is a hiker's paradise, and I believe that it would be ideal to hike in the spring/autumn months when the humidity is lower. There are many different trails with varying levels of difficulty and the park is accessible by local buses. Very often you will come across a temple during your hike - very peaceful and amazing to behold on a mountaintop."
69,5.0,Absolutely wonderful. We went hiking there on a Sunday with dozens of locals and it was a great cultural experience!
70,5.0,"what about hiking in metropolitan city, Seoul? there is really beutiful mountain just in Seoul! on the top of any peaks, you can find beautiful scenery of Seoul! This is the one of the memorable stops in Korea! Eventough it was so hot weather  but it was ok sine there are many trees making shade for us! On the way to top, I found a  temple, it was beautiful one,too like Jogyesa in town,  can see real monk,too^^If I had more time, I could go for longest course. Recommend to visit! Tips : you can see variety of course, so choose one on your level, and  there's a course you can see the fortress of Joseon Dynasty"
71,5.0,"Bukhansan is another true South Korean Gem. A national park that can give you so many different experiences from it's endless entrances. It is a mountaonous paradise but inbedded in a city  once you have entered the depts of it's beauty, you see a different world of nature and Buddist solitude. There are hundreds of treks that go from dry river beds leading to waterfall to steep mountain climbs to the most breath taking views. The odd buddist Monk dwelling a temole will pop up to give you a real insight to the life of these people. Wilderness is something to behild in Korea because no matter how high you go, a bottle of rice wine or a pop up cafe are never too far away. I spent many a"
72,4.0,"It was a great experience to try hiking in Korea. My Korean friend could not accompany me during our visit, but since we are not well prepared, he recommend us to take a route from Dobongsan Station. As we went on the weekend, we met lots of hikers along the way, so it is easily for us to find the way up. It was crowded but also very calming area surrounded with family, elders, and even couples during our visit on mid May. The weather was good, and we decided to got the map from the information office and took easy trail. But i have to warn all of you, it was not that easy even in Spring. You have to well prepared especially with great hiking Shoes since the path was slippery because of free stones. Many locals were well prepared, and most of them had trekking pole. At the first part of trail, we still can find families and young children enjoy their time near the river. As we went uphill, the chance to meet people even rare. Fortunately, The mountains filled with many temples where we can stop by, and take a rest. It took us 3-4 hours return to the entrance. Also 2 hours return way from seoul station. So it would take a day if you would like a hiking experience in Seoul"
73,4.0,"View was nice from the top, and the trails were all nicely maintained. Could have had more English signs along the way, as there were a bit of confusions at some junctions especially at the part near the temples and the ranging station as we couldn't read the Korean. There were not much hikers as we were going on a weekday. It was only around 45 min from the city center and so was very convenient and accessible by subway."
74,5.0,"We started our ascent by 730am on a Sunday, there was a nice cool breeze and the shade of the trees covered us most of the way.  By the time we were done, the park was super busy and we enjoyed the park before the crowds really hit.  I LOVED the route we took up - it was a straight rock scramble for most of the peaks.  I never would have found the path (our route for that matter) but our cab driver had just hiked it the weekend before so he recommended we start from the path we did (it was about 200 meters maybe from the Bulgwang subway station).  We hiked up to Jokduribong peak first, it took us 25 minutes but we were pushing really hard. (Our can driver said it would take 1 hour).  Being naive we thought this was it, but once we got there we looked behind us and saw the rest of the park.  It was huge and we had a ton of time to kill so we headed for the next peak.  With no map, no trail markers, we just kind of followed a few random hikers and the one trailhead pointing the direction.  Thankfully that worked out for us! The next peak we hit was Hyangnobong Peak.  Now understand that none of these peaks are SUPER high, but the change in elevation is pretty intense.  You will hand over hand climb to the top of most of these peaks.  Then we hit Bibong Peak and on to Samobowi (Rock).  After Samobowi, we went to Seunggabong Peak and finally reached our summit at Munsubong Peak and down through Daenammun Castle Gate back to the Gugi Information Center.  If we had taken the trail from Gugi up and done this hike backwards it wouldn't have been as pretty or fun.  That trail is manmade and very foresty.  It was more fun to hike up the rock scrambles and pull ourselves up via ropes and metal handrails.  At one point, if we slipped we would have plummeted to our death.  It was so fun! It took us 3 hours and 40 minutes, but we pushed hard with short few breaks.  Absolutely recommend this route!!! I wish we had more time to hit the highest peaks in the park!!"
75,5.0,"We, going very unprepared, picked the route for advanced hikers and had great fun.   There were many shops / stalls selling hiking gears and food at the bottom of the mountain and you can get prepared there.  It took us 2 hours to reach the peak.  At the beginning the route was very well paved and easy to walk.  But as we go up the road has become sandy and slippery.  I recommend wearing proper hiking shoes / boots if you plan to get to the peak.  There were big trees on the side for most parts of the path and it helped block the strong sun light.  The view was great and it was worth the muscle pain that followed haha."
76,5.0,"Due to it's closeness to the city, it's a popular weekend getaway destination among locals, as well as expats. We didn't actually walk through the trail but the surroundings are amazingly beautiful, you can get one of the best views of Seoul here. There's a few temples scattered all over the mountain, which is always a delight to visit. The nearby district has a small town feel to it, at the foot of the mountain you can enjoy a cafe at one of the tourist catering places/eateries. The park is extremely well-maintained, all in all, it can be a perfect choice for a quick trip out of Seoul as well as for hiking, obviously. Totally recommended!"
77,5.0,"We're amateur-ish hikers and we decided to tackle one of the trails to get to the top. It was not easy (We've also hiked in Colorado, Peru, etc). Overall a very enjoyable hike though. The area around the mountain is nice with a nice mountain village feel to it. I would highly suggest going early to avoid crowds!THERE IS A VERY EASY TRAIN FROM SEOUL THAT TAKES YOU CLOSE TO THE MOUNTAIN/VILLAGE. DON'T BYPASS THIS."
78,4.0,I did not hike all the way up Bukhansan cos I did not have hiking gear on. The area is peaceful and beautiful. I also visited Geumsunsa temple and attended a short temple life program. Hiking Bukhansan appears to be a popular weekend activity for locals. Come early to avoid crowds.
79,5.0,"Was in seoul for 5 days and arranged a trip here to see what I could see. Nice walks, fairly easy but steep at times up to some of the gates on the old fort. A massive park and really close to the city. Nice to see a place where apparently asiatic black bear, serow and leopard cat still roam. Saw marsh tit, nuthatch, jay, mallard, spot billed duck, magpie, flycatcher, and a nice surprise was a few Asiatic chipmunk. Really nice place. However, be warned: lots of hiking enthusiasts that are dressed and geared up for Everest listening to their music really loud from phones! Crazy, was a fairly warm day, we were in jeans and tshirt and trainers, these people were wrapped up in winter gear, hiking poles, felt like an amateur! So you definitely won't be alone here. But lovely none the less."
80,5.0,"A nice national park which was only a metro and bus ride away from the main city area of Seoul. Took us a couple of hours to make it to the summit. A word of caution, wear proper shoes and not casual shoes like I did. My husband proceeded up to the summit but I stayed back as it was getting cold, rainy and wet- a dangerous combination once you take the final leg up to the summit. I would do this again next time - with proper footwear."
81,5.0,"This is an amazing place and we absolutely loved our day here. We decided in advance of arrival to climb up to Baegundae Peak, the highest point in the park. Since we're Colorado natives and frequently climb 14,000 foot mountains back home, we assumed a 2700 foot peak would be an easy/casual climb. However, what we didn't know if that there are at least two entrances to this park. We ended up on the ""harder"" side of the route we had planned. Unfortunately, the Information Center was also out of maps when we arrived, so we only had the little bit of information we had researched ahead of time. I recommend printing out a map ahead of time from the park website just in case you get there and they don't have maps left.From the entrance to the park to the top of the peak was a constant climb. Approximately 4.6km and nearly straight up. Most of the trail is rocks and steps until you get near the top. Near the top it's massive rocks with limited foot holds and cables that you will absolutely need to hold on to in order to pull yourself up. We went on a weekend and it was incredibly busy, but the people were very nice and even with two-way traffic up and down, we were able to hike at our own pace. Be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks as it is a long hike up.On the way down, we found the route we had originally researched and planned. It's less than half the length of the trail we took up and it was a lot less steep. We took the shorter path back down. It was an easy trip down and we soon arrived at the parking lot. You can wait for a taxi or take the shuttle down the hill. We didn't want to wait, so we walked down the road for about 20 minutes to the bus stop. There were plenty of restaurants and outdoor gear shops on both sides of the park if there's something you need. I definitely would bring/buy trekking poles. It would have made our trip a lot easier."
82,4.0,Great hike.  Took about 4 hours total.  Great views of the city once you reach the midway point.  it was a very rewarding hike.  I don't think its safe to drink the spring water anymore.  I heard an older gentlemen telling his grandson it was fresh spring water years ago but has since changed.  Not sure so I would ask the visitor center next time.
83,4.0,Great break from Seoul CBD. Possible to get there by train - approximately 45 minutes and another 10 minute walk from the train station on arrival to the park entrance. Various different paths to choose from - some treks more strenuous than imagined but the view is worth the effort.
84,5.0,"Stayed in Seoul a few days and went to the top of this mountain.  It will take around 4-5 hours and is well worth it.  Very nice views from the top.  its a bit challenging in spots, but not too difficult.  We had beef rib soup at a restaurant at the bottom after the hike and then went for sauna and massages on Itaewon St.  Very pleasant day in Seoul."
85,4.0,Don't underestimate the time and difficulty level of the trails based on the appearance or age of the local hikers.  These are steep trails (mostly shaded) with some rock-hopping in places.  The views at the top are well worth the effort and it is a truly beautiful national park.
86,5.0,It was so nice to get out of the city and hike. We went on a really clear day and could see the entire city and some beautiful mountains. I would love to come back and go all the way to the top (We only did the gate route because we got there too late)
87,5.0,"Can recommend to do hiking, its easy to find a starting point and then on the way there are always maps that show you the direction. Great view from the top."
88,5.0,"30mm by metro from downtown, I went there 20 times over 5 years. I took many foreigners there and everyone enjoyed it. Plan your trail, with water, food and good shoes. You can buy all at the bottom of the trail. Go see the 1000 Buddhas and enjoy the experience, or for the most adventurous, climb the highest mountain (BaeKumBae) in Seoul and see a breathtaking view of the city"
89,5.0,"We love hiking and do a lot in Hong Kong. So baegundae peak in this park was an absolute must. It took us 5 hours in total. So be ready to spend half a day there. We started from the Jeongneung Information centre. Before you get to the information centre, get your snacks and water. There is a lady on the main street who will do you coffee and we also bought boiled eggs. She is on the same street that sells all kind of mountain and hiking gear. Take gloves, you will need it. Make sure you have enough water, fruits and snacks (no littering, so a bag to put your litter too). The information centre has a map in Korean. But you can ask them to pinoint the various points (gates). We did the following route - Daesong Mun Gate - Bogungmun gate - Daedong Mun - Youngammun - Baegundae peak. 4 hours to the top, more time if it is crowded.The climb is challenging but magical. Try to stay on the well trodden path. You can get lost if you leave the trail. We had a Korean guy who kind of adopted us. He didn't say much but just walked with us. All we knew was that he was going to Daesong Mun gate. But he decided to walk with us upto B. gate. We shared our snacks with him as he revealed some look out points with us. Walking along the fortress wall to Bog....Peak has amazing views, but it is a stony path. I have runner's knee and that didn't help especially going down ( I really had to watch out as my next marathon is only 2 months away). But spectacular panoramic view of Seoul from Bog...Peak. Then it is an undulating climb, fairly easy but once you cross Youngammun and there is baegundae challenging your spirit. here you are clambering onto flat granite rocks, holding onto steel ropes (that's why you need gloves). IT is a challenge so worth conquering. It is steep so just be cautious, move your body forward and heel down. Just climb. At the peak, the views of Seoul are magnificent. We were there on a particularly perfect hiking weather day - blue skies, clouds and no humidity. Just perfect. At the very top, you know it was all worth the 836 metres you just climbed! Make your way down and depending on the time, you can choose the route you want to take back. We arrived at the Ui DOng side where there is a temple. The temple bus will take you down to the main street to further catch transport.If you love the outdoors and hiking is your thing, this is a must"
90,5.0,"We came here by mistake.. insufficient instructions to the cab driver.  The mountains are beautiful and we arrived to hear chanting at several of the Buddhist Temples.  The temples are beautiful, done in teal, blue, red, pinks."
91,4.0,"Requires a certain level of fitness, and the signs get less English the further you venture from the start.  The Koreans who were the only ones we saw on the walk roam all over the mountain, so try and remain on the widest most used path.  The higher up you go the more spectacular the views become, so if you have the time go to the top, which considering the stops for photos can take between 2 to 3 hours.  The path does rise up and down and at places you will find wooden steps to help your ascent, but be warned at times you will have to make your way over boulders.  Closer to the top you will find the remains of the old forts that use to watch over the valleys, which give commanding views of the city.  Take water and food with you as there is none available on the route, and you will be hungry after the climb.  Overall we found it an enjoyable experience and would recommend it for anyone if they like hiking, if you don't please disregard this review."
92,3.0,"If it is your first time here I suggest climbing the tallest peak. Just get on bus 704 from whatever station is closest and walk through main gate, you will see the signs. It is around 4 km to the top.Entrance is free, there is no food or drinks to buy after the road is no longer paved, so bring enough water for 2-3 hours of hiking (there is a stream near the top that a lot of Korean people drink from, they said it was safe but I didn't risk it, especially with all the rubber smell from the shops you can smell).If you go at a good pace you will do this in 2 hours, plus the time you stay at the top. The rocks are slippery when wet so be advised. The restaurants and cafes around the base are overpriced, but I recommend Cafe 1%, the desserts were awesome. The base has around 20 different shops selling mountain climbing gear... pretty pointless, you could do this in flip flops if it's not raining... but 90% of the Korean people were all decked out for this short hike.The view at the top is so-so, which is why I gave 3/5. I prefer natural beauty, cities only at night. You couldn't even see the city barely because of all the pollution. Pictures of the surrounding mountains were also not good. It has been this way every time I've climbed here and Namsan, no matter winter or summer."
93,4.0,"It is not banff or anything however to be able to find such a place in the bustle of a busy city like seoul can be truly refreshing. A great contrast from all the shopping and city life, to be able to be outdoors and enjoy nature. There are some fantastic views. Be prepared to walk and ascend fast. Take your time if you are even slightly out of breath or out of shape."
94,5.0,"There are several different paths to hike so I highly recommend you look into thr paths first to determine which level is for you. The beginning paths are nice and paved and at a low incline. As you get higher up some paths leads you through rough rocky path ways that could be a bit dangerous and definitely physically straining on those who arent use to hiking. Dress appropriately with running shoes and and bring lots of water (there are places in between where you can buy small bottles of water as well but once you get higher up and the trail gets rougher, theres no water avail). Many older koreans seems to go through these trails alot but are fully equipped with walking sticks and etc. Going up its very scenic and the tall trees offer you shade so its not too hot even in the middle of july. Hope everyone enjoys the view!"
95,4.0,"There are several summits that can be scaled. Accessible by metro. Dobong-san is where we hiked from, a major access point. 2 hours up for us as a determined middle age couple, one of who has never previously hiked. In July it was very sweaty and we drank 2 litres of water each going up, but it was relatively easy to head up with normal sneakers. You'll be sore the following day. Great views from the summit of Jaunbong."
96,5.0,"The park is easily accessible by metro and bus from Seoul and is a great day trip. There are several treks which you can undertake, for all levels of fitness. Obviously we went for the most challenging: Baegundae Peak - which is the highest peak. I understand that some people might find it difficult, there are some parts which are really challenging, but to be honest it's not so bad. The views from the top are excellent and we enjoyed a good Kimbap lunch (which we bought from the station). The descent can cause a few problems due to the many steps which can cause stress on the knees - a walking stick is recommended. Entrance was free which is always a good thing :)"
97,5.0,The climbing is a little tricky (wear proper shoes!) but is definitely worth to go to the top of the mountain and admire the view on Seoul city.
98,4.0,Great hike! Not too steep but still exhausting on a moderate to warm day. Perfect for the part-time/casual hiker. Had some great encounters with some Korean hikers on the way up too. A few different routes to take but you can buy maps from the tourist center so there is no chance of getting lost. Views are nice on a clear day. Probably more scenic during the summer when there is more greenery.
99,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went to the park on a hot humid day in late June 2015. I loved the experience, and my boyfriend who is somewhat less into hiking thought it was great in retrospect but during the hike it was a slightly different story.A few tips/suggestions from our experience:TRANSPORT:We took the Subway to Mangolwosa stop. This was approx 75 minutes from Coex where we were staying. Its a long way from the heart of Seoul. We then walked (mostly uphill) to the entrance of the park which is about 10-15 mins walk.PARK ENTRANCE:There were no signs that we were aware of from the subway station to the park entrance. From the University end of the Subway stop, head toward the mountains on the main road, and if there are any turns in the road/bifurcations, head in the direction of the mountain. You will go under an overpass and then you will see a the volunteer office where you can get a map. There is no place at this entrance to register (that we are aware of) and they do not require your passport (we had heard we might need it so we brought them anyhow). There is also no entrance fee.TRAILS: (We hiked to Mangolwosa temple, then to the ridegeline, then to a stream, then back. Views were amazing. Hike was hard. Took us 3-4hrs round trip). Trails are not well marked despite there being signage a semi-frequent intervals. To get to the trail from the parking lot (near the volunteer office) to Mangolwosa temple you have to go along a short trail lined with small restaurants beside a creek. It seemed an unlikely start to a trail, but this is it. Bring your map. If you are lost ask one of the many hikers on the trail, and be persistent as no one will volunteer to talk to you as they are on a serious hike. Locals are decked out in expensive gear. In my opinion, if you are relatively fit, you dont need any special gear. That said, if you are not in good shape, this hike could be quite challenging. Also, if you have a fear of heights, there are parts of this trail that would be quite scary. OTHER TIPS:Don't leave too late in the afternoon as between water and snack breaks (bring plenty!) it will take several hours. Running shoes or hiking boots are a must.Mosquito repellant o bug spray would have been nice. They swarmed around us but didnt bite.Bring a camera- there are great views!We have heard that on the weekends, it is very busy. It was well used on the weekday when we went, but certainly it wasnt very busy.There are a few (not many) outhouses en route. You cannot buy any water or snacks on the trails. There are a few streams where you can drink the water (don't know how clean/unclean it is...appeared clean and locals drank it)"
100,5.0,"Easy to get to, Buchanan Park offers nice hiking trails in a serene environment. After five days in the city, we decided to relax and go hiking. We decided on the longest route, circling clockwise. There were some peaks along the way which required steep climbing. It was so calm, with hardly anybody in the trails. Since it was a Monday, we money met seniors along the way. We did not complete the largest loop, but still hiked for three and half hours. Overall a very good workout. To get there, we took Bus 162 from our area in Insadong,  which goes all the way to the park entrance."
101,5.0,"Bukhansan is one of the most favorite mountain in Seoul. There are many different ways to go. If you have enough time, trekking or climbing several courses. You can see the beautiful skylines and good view of Seoul City."
102,5.0,"Very interesting to see and experience how people lived in days gone by.  Well laid out, landscaped beautifully, able to stroll around at leisure.  We had fun sticking our heads through the cut out costumes and taking photos."
103,4.0,"We trekked from the Jeongneung Parking Lot/Information Centre (where you ca buy a map for 1000 won) to the peak (Baegundae, 836.5m) which took us 4 hours, and headed down in the direction of Buhkansanseong Information Centre which took us 2 hours. The walk up is difficult and steep, however were distracted by the beauty of the fort which you follow for much of the way. Highly recommended considering the views of Seoul you'll get at the top."
104,5.0,"Was great to get out of the city and spend a day hiking in the national park. With a variety of trails to choose from you can pick what suits your hiking abilities. We decided on a more difficult trek and it was challenging at times and very rewarding. As we read from previous hikers, we packed a light snack along the way and this was a great idea. Also it's a good idea to wear proper shoes. Great day out can get busy but highly recommended."
105,4.0,"I love this national park.  It took me 4 hours to go up and 2 hours to come down.  My mum who was 70 managed to hike to the peak with me.  :)  There are many nice trees with spring flowers dotting around the mountain.  Do pack some food like Sushi rolls at the metro before you visit the mountain and you can sit down and munch the food while admiring the surrounding like the Korean do.  When we come down and reached the foot of the mountain, it's already 5pm but there were still many people going up.  Highly recommended."
106,4.0,"I was expecting this to be a hiking trail for some reason, but it was a lot of stairs. When you get to the top, though, you have an amazing view."
107,5.0,"There are many different trails in this park and we happened to pick one that was more strenuous than we thought.  Don't be fooled by the elderly folks that are all over the place - they must be in great shape to climb over some of the huge boulders.  This was no walk in the park - many times we were on our hands and knees (and on our bottoms on the way down).  Some of the cables and poles on the trail are there for a reason - there would be no other way to hoist yourself up and over parts of the trail.  That said, you are rewarded of stunning views and a really good workout!  Also, just about every local was outfitted in proper hiking gear (boots, pants, jackets, hats and walking sticks) and you there was no shortage of vendors selling this gear.  We had on sneakers and jeans and did just fine so don't be intimidated if you aren't wearing the latest and greatest hiking gear."
108,5.0,We took a tour via Viator to the National park. It was quite a nice (not easy) walk up the mountain with a big Buddha face carved up the mountain and a temple. it was fun despite the cold weather.
109,5.0,"So, me and my partner wanted to do what Koreans do, so we decided hiking. We thought our normal attire is good enough. But we are so wrong. Recommended time to the peak is 1.5 hours, but it took us 4 hours since we dont have any experience and dont have any gear/equipment.But once you reach the top, the scene and view is really breath taking."
110,5.0,We took the hike up the hill and met a really nice older Korean man.  While talking we told him we liked the temples so at a fork in the trail about a mile in from the trail head we took the left fork rather than proceed to summit and gate and there is an awesome temple and large Buddha a short hike to left.  We did not continue on to summit and gate because it was a very foggy day with no chance of a view
111,4.0,"Bukhansan National Park gets approximately 5 million visitors a year so expect it to be BUSY! We went on the biggest Korean national holiday, Chuseok, which normally keeps people at home. By the afternoon the trails were full of people. Luckily we left early enough in the morning to make it to Baegundae Peak before the crowds set in. If you google pictures of this peak you will see the enormous lines of people waiting to climb the peak. Besides the people, the hike itself if worth doing. It is extremely difficult. I can't stress this enough, the hike to Baegundae peak is exhausting. It's is extremely steep for almost the entire trail and the last portion is dangerous. You are required to hold on to cables to pull yourself up to the top. Not for the faint of heart! I recommend going, but you need to be aware of the crowds and the difficulty."
112,5.0,My friend and I were visiting Seoul for five days and decided to explore the Bukhansan Nationalpark one of Seouls hinterland attractions which was in retrospective the highlight of our South Korea trip. The hike is kind of challenging and it takes in total approximately 6 hours (return trip). It was really steep and rocky but the view was amazing and priceless. The area was really clean and well organized. Totally recommend this hike - two thumbs up.
113,5.0,"trekking in Bukhansan is a unique experience: one moment you are in a busy, modern city, the next you are surrounded by nature. Bukhansan National Park is within easy reach with Seoul metropolitan public transport. Maps: if you are looking for a good map you can get it at one of the Bukhansan National Park Information centres (we got ours from Jeongneung Information Center). The map is mainly for the Dulle Gil (the circular trail around the base of Bukhansan and Dobongsan however the trails up the mountain and to the peaks are marked too). The map has also information on how to reach the various entry points by public transport from Seoul. Trails: there are a number of trails up to the highest peak (Baegundae) we went up from Jeongneung Information Center and came down to Bukhanseong Collective Facilities Area. UP: Jeongneung Information Center > Daeseongmun Gate > Bogungmun Gate > Yongammun Gate > Winmun Gate > Baegundae Peak (3 hours with a short snack break and photo stops)DOWN: Baegundae Peak > Winmun Gate > Gaeyeon Falls > (start of paved road) Muryangsa > Daeseomun Gate > Bukhanseong Collective Facilities Area (1.5 hour keeping a rather sustained pace). The trail up was long however not overly demanding apart from the last section (Wimun Gate to Baegundae Peak). This last section is the only part where you have to scramble up on steep and flat granite rock (there are rails to help however). This last section has narrow areas and some parts allow space for only one single line of hikers, this means that at busy times a queue may form and it may take some time to get to the peak depending on the abilities of those in front of you). Keep calm and enjoy the magnificent views. Even if you decide not to go to the very top there are still some amazing views from the rest of the trail and in my opinion it is well worth the hike. The trail from Bukhanseong Collective Facilities Area to the Baegundae peak is more direct (read: steeper) so it will be more demanding in terms of effort. We did it going down and being autumn there was some amazing foliage to be seen however if you come up this way you will not see the magnificent views until the very top because of the tree coverage. Coming up from Jeongneung Information Center the trail is rather varied. The type of trees change throughout the trail and you pass a few gates. There are some amazing views. I definitely recommend it. Overall an amazing experience, not overly physically demanding if you are reasonably fit. I want to go again and do a different peak. PS: if you don't want to climb peaks or go up steps too much you could try one of the many trails along the Dulle Gil route. This is a 71.5 km circular trail that can be done in sections (if you go to the information centre you can even get a passport where you can collect stamps for each section you have completed). On separate occasions I did section 8 of the Dulle Gil but I was not overly impressed with the landscape there however I also did a short stroll on section 6 (Pyeongchangmaeul-gil) and it was very beautiful. This national park has a lot for everybody and if you like hiking it can keep you busy over several weekends or day trips. if you are visiting Seoul and want to see it from the top I recommend hiking up to one of the peaks.If you are looking for outdoor gear head to Bukhanseong Collective Facilities Area: I have never seen so many shops of outdoor gear shops including world famous brands. To get to Jeongneung Information Center: use Seoul Metro and get off at Gireum Metro station (Subway line 4) > from exit 3 catch bus 110B or 143 to the last bus stop.To get to Bukhanseong Collective Facilities Area: Gupabal Station (Subway Line 3), Exit 1 and take Bus 704 get off at Ipgok-samgori then walk through the area with all the outdoors shops.If you want to read my blog post do a Google search for ""bukhansan ros in wonderland"""
114,5.0,"The hike is spectacular, especially in the fall. In total, it took us 4.5 - 5 hours (it depends on your speed and the time you take to look around and take pictures) on a weekday. We took Line 3 to Gupabal station. Once you get to the street level, you will see a colorful line of mostly local hikers lining up to take a bus (34 or 704) to the entrance of Bukhansan park. You can get off when most people in the hiking gear get off (about 15 minutes of the bus ride).The hike is pretty strenuous - do not underestimate it. Please wear sturdy hiking boots and be ready for a constant ascent for the last two hours of the climb, in most places, it's quite steep. The last part was fun - you have to use the steel ropes to climb up as you would be climbing on the slippery and steep open stone. The views are breathtaking at the top - it was a bit hazy but still worth it. Make sure that you leave enough time to climb down before the darkness."
115,5.0,"Nov. 1, 2014 is one of most memorable day in my life. I had a chance and time to go to Bukhansan National Forest in Seoul, South Korea with my Wife. If you are in Seoul during Fall season Late October to middle of November (Or any time of the year) and like nature,  want to  Hike an excellent hiking route, you should strongly consider going to this place. When I went to Seoul for work, local Manager Man-Hee Cho suggested me to go to this mountain as I asked him some good places to visit for Nature and Forest.Attached photos will tell the short story, however, no words can describe the actual experience. Typical fall days in Seoul are Crisp and clear, with slight breeze. We were fortunate that the temp. on this day was slightly higher, however, if you like hiking and want to go all the way to the top of ONE of the point. You should not wear heavy jacket, but couple of layers with light jacket will work better. Make sure your hands are free and hence carry light BACKPACK with plenty water and snacks for this hiking and wear good shoes. Be careful while waking as during fall season many leaves are on the ground and can become slippery. If you can arrange for hiking sticks, it will help you during descend, since it can be very tricky.We hiked total of 15-16 kilometers in the forest and it took entire day. Seoul is well connected with Subway and buses. We went to Gubapal subway station (Line 3) (exit 1) and took a bus # 704 (or 34) to Bukhansan National forest Entrance.We started little late and hence reached the entrance around 11:30 AM on Saturday morning. Went on the Daenammun Course, on the way we stopped for a while to eat some fruit and take rest. With gods grace we met local Pastor, Mr. Kim Kun Ki (김 군 기) at this rest stop. He offered few jujube fruit to us and then we offered him an apple. He is more than 10 years older than me, however his energy and stamina was much better than us. Because of his encouragement we could go all the way to the top of the mountain, as he keep on saying in his broken English, ""Mr Shashi, we are together all the way to the top"" and then saying it is just 20 min form here when in total it took more than 1 hr from the spot we asked HOW far top is :-(.The cool breeze from the wonder full orange/red and yellow leaves of tress of the hiking trail is really giving us feeling of in the heaven and we are getting relief from our tiredness form hiking.The weather was clear and we actually started sweating since we wore little heavy jackets, in fact after 2 and 2.5 we were so warm that we had to remove our jackets and put in our backpacks.From the look at the variety of trees and shrubs, I think this will be beautiful hike during ANY season of the year (May be little hot during summer season and little too cold during very cold days). There is no entrance fee for the park and there are some places where you can but food and water.While coming back Mr Kim, helped us a lot to get to the bus station and since we were staying in Jamsil area, he was gracious enough to ride with us all the way to Dandaemun bus station, and he even paid for our bus fare.The sample photos posted here are as mentioned are just sample and I have many more pictures of this perfect natural beauty and will cherish them for the rest of my life.Shashikant Bhandari"
116,5.0,"We started climbing Baegundae quite late, started out at 2pm and reached the peak at about 4pm. But even in the fading light, the beauty of the rock peaks prevailed. The trail up is clearly marked, but it definitely a bit tricky in some part. Tips:- Definitely wear proper hiking boots, ideally with ankle support as mine definitely twisted a few times, thankfully without any sprains. - Another item that was a lifesaver was climbing gloves. If you have forgotten to bring yours, head down to a Daiso shop, and get a pair of gardening gloves with the rubber-dipped fingers and palms. They cost approximately USD2, and will protect your hands from the cold and the strain of hanging on/pulling up on the metal ropes.-Weekdays are the way to go. Avoid weekends at all cost, we decided on a thursday and the turnout was actually good, passing about 100 people along the way to the top, which is a good number spread out, both coming up and down the peak. Most climbers that day were locals! -Other than that, pack a light lunch, and lots of water. Most people eat their lunch at the rock outcrop very near the actual top of Baegundae peak. On the way down, you can have a nice hearty Chi-Maek (Chicken + Beer), that is near the bus station. Bus 120 will take you back to Suyu Station.We would definitely revisit Bukhansan again, such a majestic and beautiful site. The adjacent peaks were also available for climbing, but Baegundae seems to offer the best views. Maybe next time, we will try other trails!"
117,5.0,"BuKansan is located very close to Seoul city centre. It is assessable through both  train and bus. Reasonable steep steps for hiking. Prepare yourself  with good hiking shoe, jacket and hiking stick. Restaurant at the bottom of the hill is nice for grilled meat and beer too."
118,5.0,"difficult to get to him, but worth the time spent there, a quiet and green place near Seoul, you can spend all day here, it's a great place to relax ,i'm in love with this place"
119,4.0,"Bukhansan national park is great for escape from city crowd and noise, it's around 40 minutes by metro from city center, and then around 15 minutes walk from metro station to park entrance, its a tiring and demanding hike, if you are not good athletic you will get tired quickly before you even start,"
120,3.0,"Avoid peak season, weekdays seems fine. Pick a trail that you are comfortable with and do not just follow the crowd ( mainly ajumma & ajeossi).. After a long hike, be sure to dip your foot into the spring water. Heaven at it's best!  And yes, go prepared!"
121,5.0,"Getting there. First take Subway Line #4 for Suyu station, leave out Exit #3 where you will cross half the street to bus stop.  There are three glass covered benches, you will want to take bus #101.  Stay on this bus and get off on the stop right after it makes a U-turn.  You will see a Northface store on the corner, turn right up this road and straight on till morning!   We did the Baegundae Peak hike, which is the highest and most popular in Bukhansan National Park.  We went the day after Chuseok, and ended up getting a late start which actually ended up being to our advantage.  We hit the trail head about 3:45pm where we were met by a heavy resistance of thousands of people flooding off the mountain, trekking poles in hand, covered from head to toe in neon gore-tex.  Like two salmon, seemingly under dressed for the occasion and fighting the current we swam upstream.  After the first kilometer it started to thin out, and the sound of Korean ballads being pumped from smartphone speakers slowly faded.  This is where that late start thing paid off.  I had heard horror stories of people having to wait in line to get to the peak, but it seems we missed rush hour.  And after making it to the top of Baegundae, I would not want to do this hike on a packed day.  There are a few sections of this hike near the top where if you were to slip and fall it would surely be serious injury or death.  Needless to say it gets a little gnarly, and if you are scared of heights you may not want to do this hike.Overall, the total out and back took us about 3 hours, and we ended up getting down just as it was almost to dark to see.  It really is a great place to see amazing sites of the city.  It's also a little more intense than your normal hiking experience, which I really liked.  It ended up being a mix of hiking a boarder line mountaineering/rock climbing.  If you do end up doing this hike, I would say it's an absolute must to bring decent shoes with plenty of grip!"
122,4.0,"For outdoorsy types, don't miss a visit to Bukhansan. It makes up for absolute ""altitude"" with the variety of rugged climbs, its grand sweeping views, challenging and varied routes, and just ease of getting to from greater Seoul. You can hop on a bus or subway and be hiking in less than an hour. Weekends of course during the ""peak"" seasons of spring and fall are going to be crowded with big groups of ajumma and ajeossi (40s & 50-something hikers dressed to the nines in hiking paraphernalia), so if possible do go during weekdays: you'll have it almost all to yourself. An attempt on Baegundae, the sheer-faced high point, is tough and steep at the end but well worth the effort. Try to find or download some maps so you know the best access point to where you're staying. And go prepared!! It is a big area, not some little kiddie park."
123,3.0,"We spent the day at Bukhansan (after only intending to spend the morning).  Bring supplies, because there are none once you get past the base of the mountain.Once you start trudging your way up the hill, severely underdressed and with no hiking sticks, you will see the occasional marker or sign.  Do not attempt to go to the tallest peak unless you are extremely athletic - this is not like some of the other ""mountain hikes"" in Korea.  There were a couple of temples along the way, but not much in the way of the view until you got to a peak.  The place is also extremely crowded on weekends and there are lines to reach the summit."
124,5.0,"A 45 minute subway ride to the Dobongsan Metro Stop.  Don't be scared by all of the serious hiking gear - it is hard (you need the basics - water, snacks, trail runners, rain coat) for a half day hike if you are in decent shape.  Great temples to see and views to be had.  We loved getting out of the city for a little while and exercising!"
125,5.0,"This was a great place to hike, there were several routes, but we did a short one (3 hours round trip). The views were amazing. Good workout and trip away from the city."
126,5.0,"Take the subway to the north of Seoul, either until Suyu, Gupabal, Gileum, Bulwang or Dobongsan, actually everything is ok. Dobongsan is maybe the easiest though because you will arrive just next to some kind of hiking village. Just go through and you'll arrive at the entrance of the park. Otherwise, you need to take a bus which will bring you to the entrance. Basically, the best thing to do is to spot a korean hiker (with their flashy jackets, it's rather easy) and follow him untill the park. Then, when you arrive at the entrance, you'll see a big map which indicate the popular hiking trails and the difficulty and the time you'll need to reach your destination. You can then choose where you wanna go. Everything is beautiful so don't worry too much about your itinerary. On the way, make sure the visit the temples lost in the mountain. If you ever doubt about which direction to take, the hikers are usually very friendly and will be happy to indicate you the way. So just go there on a sunny day and enjoy the view!"
127,4.0,"Korean people climb mountains that is just what they do and it is a good thing they do because they make sure that these trails are well maintained and full of nice little extras like rope climbing up the side of a rockface. Which for people who like it a little bit more extreme at least gives them a faux feeling of challenge, while the novice can still have an easy enough time. The military bases near by might be slightly off putting as well they force the hiker to adhere rigidly to set paths, but overall and excellent day spent."
128,4.0,"This attraction has got wonderful views and the weather was awesome when I went there. It is in South Korea (Seoul). I was surprised to see that there were trials for everyone at this place. The place has fantastic scenery and it is close to the city. It also has a part, hiking here is famous, and I really loved this place. The mountains were beautiful and amazing. Remember to get information down the mountain and then star hiking as everything above is written in Korean. If you are a nature lover, you are sure to fall in love with this place. Great place and it is now my favorite national park."
129,5.0,"Close to the city, great views, beautiful scenery. On a clear day you can see the sea from the top. Most scenic in Autumn but adventurous in the winter"
130,5.0,"1 day hiking in this park was definitely worth it, it's a bit demanding physically but great to escape the big city life! Beautiful nature and mountains! On my top 3 of Seoul!"
131,4.0,"It is an enjoyable trip to go to Bukhansan National Park.  However, it is a tough trip.  At the entrance to the Park, it is easy.  You can enjoy the natural scene.  However, the high you go, the more difficult to climb.  Don't forget to bring with you hiking gears, and gloves."
132,4.0,"We decided to visit this park as it was within Seoul city limits.  Additionally, there was public transportation to the park.  From Seoul Station we took line 1 to Dobongsan Station.  It took about 40 minutes to get there.  It was a rainy day but we decided to get to the park anyways.  After getting off at the Dobongsan station, we walked about 30 minutes before getting to one of the park entrances.  Excellent for hiking at all levels.  We wandered in the park for about two hours and had a great time.  Very well preserved and clean.  The transportation in Seoul is excellent.  As previously mentioned, the day was foggy and drizzling therefore, we didn't get the best view of the peaks but it was worth going and walking in the park for a couple of hours.  Enjoy!!"
133,4.0,"The nicest thing about this mountain range is that, it is located right next to Seoul. It is very easy to get to. It does have some rough hikes if you go high up, or it now has dul-le-gil, which is basically a hiking route around the mountain which you can access from many points around the city. You can hike just few hours and come down for meals and coffee or you can hike for days."
134,4.0,"hieasy and quick (approx 1 hrs by subway) access from Seoul.very good prepared walking paths (most parts are in the shadow), impossible to  get lost , just follow the crowds or grap a map from the tourist info. we did it on a public holiday. for me there were to many hikers around us ;-)cheers"
135,4.0,"I really like how you can go hiking from so close to Seoul. This is a nice mountain with a good view of the city. Of course, being located  so close to Seoul makes it pretty busy, so expect to see lots of others."
136,5.0,"We visited the park in January and there was about 5cm of snow. Great landscapes, beautifull nature. We did not have nice views because whole Seoul was completely covered by smog fog. But we are sure if there won ´t be smog, the views´ll be amazing.  There are many hiking tracks, long and short ones you can choose from. Be carefull, because there are more entrances to the park. If you plan to see a specific part of the park, you should know where exactly you have to start. Because the park is large, you might not be able to reach the place you wanted, because your starting point ´ll be too far. Also the budhistic temples and fortresses were very nice. If possible we would rather spent more time - at  least few days there - but also 4 hours were worth to do it."
137,5.0,"Took underground from CIty Hall to Dobongsong Station, then just followed all the other hikers. Went on a weekday and it was still pretty busy, I'd hate to see how busy it got during the weekend. Went first week in November and the autumn colours were spectacular. Took about 4 1/2 hours round trip from the information hut. The last 1/2 hour is very strenuous but well worth it for the view at the top."
138,5.0,Close to the down town. Just around 30 minutes traffic from Myeong-dong to Bukhansan  (Not include the long queue up of waiting bus). The trail is challenging. Need more preparation for the hike. The sign here mostly only in Korean.
139,4.0,"You have to be in shape to make it to the top.  Be prepared for at least a 2 hour climb and bring a couple water bottles and a snack.  Very pretty, but not the most quiet or pretty mountain in Seoul.  Try Ansan for  a more laid back climb."
