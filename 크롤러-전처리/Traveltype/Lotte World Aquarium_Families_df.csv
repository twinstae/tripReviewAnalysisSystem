The aquarium was located at the other side of the Lotte mall. The aquarium was new and well space out onto two floors. As with all aquariums around the world, you get to see almost the same typical species of marine animals on display. However, they have the beluga whale that is our first seeing it up close in an aquarium. Interesting! You can also ""bottle"" feed the fishes on the second floor which is our first too. My boys had a fun times feeding the fishes through bottles. Is definitely a memorable experience for them."

And we got to enjoy a free churos as well.Not a bad choice to see a wide variety here and the penguins was so playful and engaging! Jelly fish was so beautiful, seeing it glow. Great for the kids to learn more of the marine life.Cons: The place was a little bit of confusing of where to go next. Like, left or right kind."

If you're a foreigner, Trazy has a great combo ticket price for both the Aquarium and Lotte Adventure....The belugas made me a bit sad because they seemed so bored-- just swimming in the same circles over and over. But the rest of the exhibits-- especially the huge tank with the giant rays-- are pretty stunning."
3,4.0,"Beautiful aquarium. Went to this aquarium as it is part of the ticket I purchased which is a Lotte World + Aquarium ticket. It is a 10 min walk away from Lotte World. At the basement of Lotte Plaza. Like many aquariums we have visited, it features many species of fish and marine creatures. The most unique ones are the Beluga whale and the axolotl."
4,5.0,"What an amazing aquarium. The tanks are so clean you can't even tell there is glass. Great exhibits. Beluga whales, penguins, octopus that was full on display, sea lions, and otters. Plus so many fish. Lots of underwater tunnels. Best aquarium I've ever been too!"
5,5.0,"Situated just at the city of seoul. After enjoying lotte world we went to Lotte aquarium. We were not expecting too much as we already been to many Ocean parks but to our suprise. They have 2 “Beluga Whale” yes a whale! aside from sharks, rays, big fishes, seals, sea turtles and penguins. So amazing. it was not a huge as ocean parks but what you can find inside will definitely satisfy you."
6,2.0,"If you went to Singapore or US, this aquarium will be too small for you and a big disappointment. It is small and pricy. If you want to kill time with children and are very wealthy,  please consider this place as an option."
7,4.0,"It was an enjoyable visit to the aquarium with my family and we spent about 1.5hrs there.We get to touch the starfishes and sea squirts, my 5 yr old finds it interesting. Also the showcase of jellyfishes intrigues her. I was hoping to finish touring the aquarium fast but it’s actually pretty big. Be prepared to spend some time there if you have kids."
8,5.0,Somehow the quality of the glass tunnel was superb. So clear that it really felt like you were in the water with the fishes. This quality may not be found in other aquariums.
9,4.0,"Went to the aquarium after visiting lotte world on the same ticket you can buy a combo ticket online, the aquarium is on the b1 and b2 level of the mall which is a 5 min walk from lotte world.There are a fair few species of aquatic animals and some spiders and lizards. The y also hold educational sessions on a fair few of them the sea lion were definitely the pick for us and some small sharks as well. Sting rays were aplenty and the sea horses were of beautiful color not ones I had seen before. The kids loved it a must if you have a couple of hours to kill."
10,5.0,"All the family members enjoyed the place, variety of sea and river creatures, with nice activities for the kids like feeding the fish, touching the sea stars and nice souvenirs shop at the end."
11,5.0,We went with our toddler and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very kids friendly with a great diversity of species. Highly recommended.
12,4.0,I always enjoy aquariums. The size of the main tank is awesome! It was neat to see them but I feel really bad for the beluga whales.
13,4.0,"We got discounted combo tickets for both Lotte World and the Lotte Aquarium so we went here after we were done with Lotte World.  It was a nice, clean, and cool place to go if you want to escape the summer heat and outside rain.  The tanks were all kept clean and strategically spaced out so it's not too crowded with people.  Our favorite areas were the beluga whales, the sea otter, and the short walkthrough with the overhead aquarium.  The kids enjoyed it, and it was a good size so that it's not overwhelming for them."
14,5.0,"It's something you wouldn't expect from a shopping mall. As you go further in, you'll discover a whole new world. There were four adults and five children in our group, and all of us enjoyed our trip there. The huge tank and the varieties of species, there's lots to see and fun things to explore. It's definitely worth a visit!"
15,5.0,"This aquarium is huge and nice. If you're planning to go to Lotte World, be sure to keep your ticket because there's a discount for your entrance fee to this aquarium. The water system was so good that it's water is crystal clear. A lot of rare fishes could be find here. I've been loving the very huge tank with its super thick glass. Be sure to catch the feeding time for fishes too. One could actually spend 1-2hrs here in the aquarium as it is huge."
16,3.0,"For the prices, we were expecting a great aquarium. I may have been spoiled by the ones in Cinncinatti OH, and New Orleans, La, but this one missed the mark. Pretty standard and nothing special. We were kinda shocked when we got to the end and even the kids asked if that was the whole thing. Took maybe 30 minutes to get through and we paid almost 90 bucks."
17,3.0,"If you don't have much to do, and are trying to kill 1-2 hours, this is a decent aquarium to attend.  I might be biased, as the Osaka and Atlanta aquarium have set me with high standards.  BUT, I do believe that this aquarium (compared to some of the best in the world) is sort of expensive, for what it has to offer.  I believe that I either paid the same or more, to attend this aquarium, compared to top-rated aquariums, like the ones in Osaka, Japan and Atlanta, GA (USA).  That being said, the animals/mammals that they have inside the aquarium seem to be well fed and have enough room to get around.  If you go on the weekend, plan for it to be packed, as it was for our last trip.  My family and I have went during the week, and there was no line to feed the fish or do anything other ""extra"" activities within the aquarium.  Plan for a 10-20 minute wait on the weekends for those activities.  All of this being said, this aquarium is NOT BAD, it's just sort of pricey, for what it has to offer.  I recommend going here at least once, whether you're on vacation, or just trying to kill time.  If you drive to Lotte World mall, you get a discount for the parking (if you attend the aquarium), so keep your receipt, as the parking is the most expensive as I've ever seen."
18,4.0,"There are still a number of interesting displays.  A room of jellyfish, a huge tank with lots of fish, two beluga whales, a spot for kids to touch fish and other small water creatures, baby otters, an alligator, and a few other tanks with different fish.  It was a great way to spend several hours in the afternoon.  The great thing is it's in Lottes'  World Mall, which has tonnes of other things to do, so the Aquarium can be a one thing in a full day of stuff, all in the same location."
19,4.0,"This is one of the best aquariums I've seen in Korea.  They have an assortment of many types of fish to see.  The aquariums are also well sized for the fish to swim around in and to view.  The highlight is the hugs 2 story glass window where you feel as though you are in the ocean itself.  Its amazing to see so many fish in one tank.  There is also a little play area for small children to make things.  It was really nice to have an arts and crafts place for kids as well as a feeding area where kids can feed fish.  The only bottleneck is the Whale aquarium where its hard to see anything when its crowded and there is only one entrance and exit.  Aside from that, its nice to spend a few hours there on a hot summer day.  When you finish, you have the whole mall to peruse.  I recommend it especially if you have children."
