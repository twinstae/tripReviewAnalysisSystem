1,5.0,It's an oasis in Seoul. Walking in this park/mini forest really makes you think you're out in the country side. It's very relaxing and enjoyable. Many attraction for kids as well. Great for outdoor activities.
2,5.0,"If you're staying somewhere along Apkujung or Cheongdam, this park is just across the river on Seong-su bridge. Nice place to go for a run."
3,5.0,"We enjoy walking in city parks and this one has sculptures, a deer consul, insect and butterfly gardens (although the latter sections are bare bones in October.) If you have children, there are some  good play structures, slides and lots of free space to run around in."
4,3.0,"This is a park and not really a forest as the name suggested. There are many areas to sit around and have picnic, This is a park where locals will go and have their week end family picnic or gathering. Nothing much for the tourists."
5,4.0,"I always enjoy getting out into fresh air and be amongst trees. Worth the train travel to reach this lovely spot. Walking paths good. Relax and rejuvenate with the peaceful surroundings. A few deer in an enclosure sure to delight. You can walk all the way to the main Han River with great views of city. Basic cafe on site, but you can bring your own food and enjoy anywhere in the park area. We loved our visit."
6,3.0,"Ok to walk through and some sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the cityThere are deer to look at as well. They are in an enclosure, but they come up to the fence. You can buy deer food for 1000 won from a vending machine. However when we went (close to sunset) the vending machine was closed for the day."
7,5.0,Wow ! In a busy city it’s a wonderful getaway. We really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere of the forest in a city. I highly recommend it.
8,3.0,"It is very clean, with beautiful artworks installed here and there. However being a Russian I could not call it a forest... For forest is something massive, at least when you cannot see the end of the forest upon entering. Seoul forest is sort of park to me, a tiny island of nature - I would say."
9,5.0,"Seoul Forest is underrated but it’s my favourite place in South Korea especially because we went there on the middle of Autumn. It was beautiful and just provides you all the romantic —or otherwise dramatic— ambiance. With all the trees wearing different colours. Besides the deer park, my favourite place is the small stadium with a piano at the center. Make sure you practice your piano pieces before going here. It will be a memory you’ll definitely keep."
10,5.0,"Actually, we expected more from that place but it's still really cute. You can have a walk there with your partner/family/friends/dog, etc. It's convenient and it gives some calm even though it's in Seoul"
11,5.0,"I have been to Seoul Forest several times and it's been relaxing and refreshing every time. It can get pretty busy on the weekends, but still not too bad when compared to other parks in Seoul.pro tip: cherry blossoms are amazing here, best in Seoul (imo)! However, you have to walk across tukseom and gosanja intersection to get to them."
12,3.0,"Seoul forest which is 5min walk via Seoul metro (seoul forest station, Bundang line) is located close to the city. On approaching the park, there was a communal city veggie farm. It is free entry into the park and bicycles can be rented near the entrance.This large park which can be seen from Namsan Tower, housed Seoul's first water purification plant. The purification plant which is still active can be visited in the park. In addition to the purification plant, there were other attractions such as the Cultural Art park, butterflies and insect garden (there was a rabbit pen close to the butterfly garden), deer feeding at the Ecology forest or just strolling through the park.There are several convenience stores in the park selling snacks, coffee, ice cream, etc. Toilet and washroom facilities also available."
13,5.0,"In front of my house It's very lucky to have this kind of park near my housewith Metro station, easy to access to Gangnam and City center.bicycle rental available"
14,5.0,"Not comparable to Bukhansan, but nice for a day trip, if you have time to spare. I loved the atmosphere change and the good time. Worth it."
15,5.0,"A lovely bike ride around the park. Seoul Forest is hugeee! If u skateboard, there's also a skatepark with ramps and halfpipes."
16,5.0,"This is a great park for visitors of all ages to enjoy the outdoors for free. The Seoul Forest park has 5 distinct sections and is too large to see all of it in one day. There are nice, wide paths for walkers and bicyclists. We found the park to be extremely clean and well-landscaped. Bring your camera and a picnic lunch! There is also an impressive schedule of concerts and performances to see at various venues throughout the park if you like to plan in advance. We like to go simply for nature walks and find something new to do at each visit. One of our favorite discoveries was a large observation area where visitors can see different types of deer up close."
17,5.0,"Nice place to take a stroll, feed some deer, look at the Han River, and go on a picnic among the grass, trees, and water."
18,5.0,This is a large area of paths and trees in the middle of Seoul.  Having visited in February there wasn't as much happening as there would be at other times of the year and the trees and fauna was dormant. However I would love to see it in the spring. The area was very peaceful although we could hear the traffic in the background.  We saw the deer through the fence but the corral wasn't open when we went.
19,5.0,"Very big park / forest in Seoul. You can feed deers, talk around. It's just like a forest, but you do get urban and traffic noise. A must go. One of the few green attractions in Seoul."
20,5.0,"Seoul has a forest? Yes and it's wonderful. Enjoyed our walk, fed the deer, went to the museum. It was great!"
21,5.0,"The Seoul Forest amidst the hustle and bustle of the city is a surprise. The well-planned eco forest is a must do for adults and kids. The play area is innovative, the deer park also serves as a good attraction. But the best part of the forest is the walk among the foliage and the bridge which takes you from forest to harbour front. I loved the planning, the thinking and the cleanliness of the place."
22,5.0,"It was autumn when we visited this place. Never expect that it was so beautiful and peaceful. It's even more beautiful than Nami Island. There were only few people or tourists in this park and that's what I love about it. If you want to feel the autumn vibes in Seoul, this is a must visit place with so many autumn trees in different colors."
23,5.0,"It felt a bit weird to be in a lush garden with high rise office buildings in the background, but this place is well worth a visit to chill out and take a break from the city. Aside from various gardens and forests, there is also an insect display and butterfly garden. There is also a convenience store on site. The forest is easily accessed via Seoul Forest subway station. There are tours that will take you here but it isn’t necessary to be on a tour. Entry to most areas is free and there are plenty of signs to help find your way around."
24,3.0,"The day was cold, cloudy and miserable so our time here could have been much better. This is basically a nature zoo with a selection of exhibits to view, rides and activities for kids/teens and picnic areas mixed in with walks, gardens and small shops. A better day would have made us stay longer, but 2 hours was enough for me. The autumn colours were beautiful and the area well kept, clean and easy to navigate. Sunny weather would definitely provide a more positive adventure."
25,5.0,"Seoul forest is such a wonderful place. Lots to see and do. I couldn't quite believe the walk-in butterfly house was free entry as it is well maintained and a wonderful experience. Butterflies are free to fly around you so not for those afraid of bugs (some butterflies are quite big and there are a few dragonflies too). There is also a deer feeding area where you can buy deer food from the vending machine which costs 1000 won. Seoul forest is quite a large area so if you want to explore it all, get those walking shoes on! Definitely worth a visit and is a cheap day out."
26,5.0,"We visited the 'forest' as Seoul was our third stop on a trip around cities in the Far East and wanted a break from the business of the built-up city areas. The forest is more of a park than a forest but still was well worth visiting. We spent most of an afternoon here, walking the park and discovering hidden areas (small animal area, deer retreat, children's park, statue park, etc). The cafe overlooking the lake with fountains was peaceful and we happily sat with a drink and ice cream here for over an hour. We found somewhere to rent bikes by the hour (all sizes, and tandems!) for a reasonable price, and although we didn't use the facilities there were tennis and badminton courts. Overall was a great way to get out of the city and also away from touristy areas for an afternoon - would definitely recommend to someone looking for the same, particularly in summer."
27,4.0,"We went on a Monday so it was very quiet, not many people around. I enjoyed feeding the deer the food I purchased for 1000won  from the vending machine"
28,5.0,"Seoul Forest is easy to get to by metro.  There are a total of 5 parks & 16 exits/entrance.  You can get the guide map at the exit/entrance.  We were at Seoul Forest around 12.30 pm at the end Oct and therefore could only cover mainly Park 1 & Deer Corral of Park 2. We had our lunch at one of the cafeterias in it.During this autumn season, we took many photos of the awesome autumn colors especially at Forest Path (Park 1).  We saw families and students enjoying time together at the family yard, Sculpture Park and Mirror Lake too (Park 1).  We are nature lovers, so naturally we enjoyed our leisure walk appreciating the fresh air, clean and peaceful environment in Seoul Forest.   We will visit again on our next trip to Seoul."
29,5.0,So happy when my friend said he bring to Seoul Forest. After only 30min driving and still being in town : he said we arrived ! Huh !Yes yes Seoul forest is simply a big park in town. So do not think being in the middle of a forest...just in the middle of the city.However....I have to admit this is a beautiful park. Long path to walk or jog. Places to seat or pic-nic.Perfect place for fresh temperature in summer.
