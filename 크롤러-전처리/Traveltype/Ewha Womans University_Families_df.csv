3,5.0,"I mean... the architecture was incredible. Out of this world. I know I haven't been to Europe so I can't compare this to anything else but we were quite mesmerized but the overall vibe of this area. Funny story: My sister and I sneaked in to the cafeteria area (which prolly for students only since you need access card to get in) surrounding the infamous stairs. I really wanted to go there since they have Baskin Robbins Ice cream VENDING MACHINE. We managed to enter the area and guess what happened next: I tried to pay using my travle card and lost it in the machine. The cafeteria lady tried to help us by saying ""Maybe you should call this number"" but we only have wifi, not local mobile number. So I had to buy another travel card to be able to go home.Anyway, we walked around for a bit and found shopping street and bought some cheap tshirts. Overall nice experience, and someday I will go get my ice cream there!"
4,5.0,"A beautiful university campus with lots of fashion streets around it, can visit if you are interested and walkable to Sichon"
5,4.0,"It's amazing, a university has turned into a tourist place. The buildings in Ewha are very unique, you won't regret going to this place. After visiting Ewha, you can shop at the nearby shopping area."
6,5.0,"Must go, to visit the incredible architecture of ewha womans university and to shop - especially if you’re female. The stuff they’re selling are one of the better price points. There are some shops catering to male, or unisex. Many simple fakes (shirt with supreme, patagonia, champion logo) costing KRW 5,000. there are also shops selling food and drinks around"
7,5.0,"The shopping here is really cheap around 5k or 10k won at the min. and the designs are all trendy. You can't try the clothing and they're largely all free sized. For girls who can't find clothing in other areas such as gangnam bcos the general Korean free sizes are too small, this is the best area!Dont really bother with hongdae (not that cheap) or myeongdong (expensive)"
8,4.0,"My daughters came here for their clothes shopping versus actually touring the university.  There were a large number of shops selling young, trendy clothing at quite reasonable starting prices (i.e. W5000 for a shirt).  Many of the stores were full of young women shoppers.   Be sure you know your shirt size as the stores would not let our daughters try on any shirts but they were more accomodating for pants and skirts for some reason.  There was also a number of small restaurants to satisfy our hunger after spending awhile shopping."
9,5.0,My mother in law went to this school so we wanted to check it out.  It's such a beautiful campus.  Shops around there were so much cheaper than most.  My daughter bought some clothes and they were so reasonable.
10,5.0,"This university is really beautiful !! The park is nice, the building design is the combination of europe style with modern architecture in some area. Very quite and relaxing. I'm surely the student can study very well here. Near this university, there are a lot of shopping store."
11,4.0,The Ehwa Womens university is easily accessible via the train.There are plenty of shops for visitors to visit along the way before reaching the university. Great place for photo taking.
12,5.0,There have a garden around the campuss very cozy to walk around and enjoy the cold air on early april 2019.. keep your steps on the walk path.. dont mess it..
13,5.0,It is a very beautiful campus and it is tourist place. We went on public holiday and we saw so many tourist there. Good for photostop and shopping. There are many cosmetic shops and cheap bags and clothes.

15,5.0,"such a beautiful campus! walking amidst the students really made me want to study here as well, even bought many souvenirs!"
16,4.0,"Teenagers will like this place for shopping and in trend stuff.   The waffles ice cream was so good.  Must try.My boy done his first hair colour at Juno Hair salon, the service was great !"
17,3.0,Suggest to come at night if you want to take nice photo when all the lightings are switch on. There's a shopping street just opposite Ehwa Womans University. Goods sold here tend to be cheaper than what you can find in Meyongdong.
18,4.0,"Ewha is famous for its beautiful architecture! Gorgeous campus with the autumn leaves surrounding it. Very nice for photo taking. After that, walk around the streets surrounding it for some shopping & eating!"
19,4.0,"This is a real campus like most other university does, but the building and overall surrounding does look very beautiful and pleasant, the student is so lucky.The slope path way in between two campus complex is really brilliant architecture design. Everyone is having fun walking around and having Instagram session,Don't forget there is actually few more sights you can explore inside the campus & outside of the campus as well, we found some of our Seoul best deal at the shops outside campus."
20,4.0,We walked around the sculptured park and took many photos.  The park area is very wide and suitable for families.
21,4.0,This university campus has become a popular tourist attraction and the university has put up signs warning against nuisance caused by visitors. Some nice buildings are worth seeing especially its sunken library building with steps up to roof top. The campus layout is attractive but not as magnificient as Yonsei University.
22,5.0,You can have a lot of beautiful picture surrounding the University.  There are many food stalls and cafes where you can just sit and enjoy a book for whole afternoon!
23,5.0,"Well worth a walk through the university grounds, looking at the amazing glass and concrete section, with beautiful gardens at the top. Go to the information centre and you get a free talk by a student on the history, which is actually very inspiring."
24,5.0,Worth a visit if in the area.  Nice landscaped spaces to walk about with views of the city. There's a visitor's center that can provide information.
25,3.0,"After visiting the shopping centres at Dongdaemun, shopping for clothes at Ewha doesn’t have much appeal. Designs are not as good and the prices are much more expensive. There are many restaurants and cafes catered to young people. I found Belif Cosmetics shop there which I didn’t find anywhere else. I bought more stuff from shop carts and the MRT shops near there than any of the regular shops. If you are a bargain shopper for clothes like me Dongdaemun may be more suitable. We didn’t visit the university itself."
26,5.0,The university was very huge. Architecture was great as well. Didn't see much on the day of visit as it was too windy.
27,4.0,"Agreed that it a nice place to shop. However, i particularly like to visit the hair salon here. I find that it is cheaper than those at Hongdae and its much quieter too. Huge campus but too bad my attention was drawn to the many little retail shops rather than the campus itself."
28,5.0,Plenty of cheap shopping to be done and it was very convenient to come here via metro...It is also safe and opens till late evening.
29,4.0,"Things cheaper there due to cater for University students, easy to navigate and plenty of shops and restaurants there"
30,5.0,The University grounds were very pleasant to stroll about in but we did not venture into the buildings itself as it is a learning institute afterall. We went into the gift shop and browsed around in the shops in the surrounding areas. A pleasant and relaxing way to spend a few hours in this area.
31,4.0,"Great place to take pictures with many Hogworts-esque type buildings dotting the landscape.  Not surprising since the school was founded by Mary Scranton back in 1886.  The shopping streets around the campus offer lots of merchandise, but if you venture inside the campus, you'll find even better bargains because some of the stuff sold outside (like face masks) are actually available at student prices."
32,5.0,Very beautiful and spacious campus. Perfect for photo taking and also a relax walk. Most of the clothing stores at the shopping streets caters to young adults. In my opinion the clothing are cheaper compared to other shopping streets.
33,3.0,"Not exactly a must see but if you have time to spare and are into youngish college age clothings, you might want to check it out, though the items are similar everywhere.   We went there just to have a look at the university scenario."
34,4.0,"Many place for great picture. Shopping street around university. I've visited in sunny day, so lucky"
35,5.0,"After strolling around to the famous shopping place listed at Seoul like Myeondong, Hongdae etc etc, well i can guaranteed in here you can find a dress, bag with super affordable price comparing to the famous shopping area.Mostly same design, but the sell it much more cheaper...so this area so damn recommended for ladies.The ewha uni building design also so interesting,gothic and modern building design you can see in here...such a lovely place....!!!!!!"
36,5.0,"Pretty funny that the 5th ranked university in Seoul gets top billing as an attraction. We visited and the campus is very pretty. The building structures offer both archaic and modern designs. The underpass is just amazing and you will know what I mean when you visit. Outside the campus is filled with stores, shops, cafes and eateries."
37,5.0,"The area is known for affordable and trendy clothing and it did not disappoint. If you are looking for Korean fashion, this is it! Prices start from as low as 5,000 won. Didn't have time to visit the university grounds but heard that it's worth it.Literally shopped till we dropped and was recommended a KBBQ place by a shop assistant. Best place for KBBQ! Cheap and good:) A pity that we did not take down the shop name (it was in Korean) but the place is somewhere right at the end of the shopping street and has a cute pig as its mascot (hope this helps?). There wasn't any tourists while we were eating there."
38,5.0,"Bags made in korea - good quality and cheap ! 10,000won only !! women can spend whole day shopping ! remember to bring your own shopping bag !!! lots of cafes here to rest your legs as well. most of the things sold here are made in korea. have a tour into the university campus as well, very huge !! there are some push carts outside the university, they are cheaper than those shops. i bought a couple of t-shirts from there at 7000 won only !"
39,4.0,"An interesting place to visit; whereby one can see the modern building with glass panel at the entrance,with a very big garden compound and further away, the old school buildings and church buildings.  I would like to study there if I have the chance.  There were shopping streets outside the University, but  you really need to have strong legs muscle to move around the areas as there are uphills, and down slopes. Many different food outlets around the area too; like Japanese, Chinese besides Korean food, so one will have no problem looking for their favorite bites."
40,4.0,"Although it is called university it actually provides education from kindergarten up to college level, there is even a dormitory for foreign students. The university compound is very big, it's like a small town. All students and the teachers must be very healthy from all the walking exercise in the compound."
41,4.0,"It s a lovely university with a surprising underground lecture room and class room. The revolutionary new architecture is complimented by the old buildings , left from the period when it was a missionary school and college. The university is only a short distance from the Ehwa metro station. but along the way there is a lot of shops which cater to the university's students ( mainly young women).  so it s a great combination of shopping , visiting a tourist site and then eating an inexpensive meal.  ( the main target audience for the restaurants are university students ). another surprising thing you will see is the number of food deliveries when you visit the campus. we saw on average about 10 motor bikes for food delivery in the 45 mins we were on the campus ground."
42,4.0,"This is a fun place to shop as there are many clothing stores selling cheap clothings at 5000 won or 10000 won.  Besides cheap clothing stores, there are some that are more expensive clothing stores too.  If you are not into shopping, you can still pop in to this place as there are many yummy eateries selling waffles, cake, coquettes and restaurant.  Can spend 1-2 hours at least walking about here."
43,4.0,Check out the images on the internet and you will be amazed. Very serene surroundings. Just before reaching the university at a nearby ministop & am/pm store came across cherry blossoms too.
44,3.0,"beautiful university, combination of modern and contemporary building design and landscape. and not to forget affordable fashion district around the university. worth it!"
45,5.0,Beautiful school with lovely foliage scenery during our visit in November. Lots of street food and shops outside lining the streets leading to the entrance of EWHA.
46,5.0,Ewha Womans University is easily reached via Seoul's metro/subway and the station is named accordingly so it is impossible to miss.The University itself is beautiful and has it's own visitor centre showcasing it's history.There are many retail shops and eateries in the vicinity and the products are majority catering to the ladies.The location is easily accessible by train and it is a great place to visit for both ladies and gentleman.
47,4.0,Ewha Woman University is right next to shopping area. The building and garden in the university entrance are nicely designed and you can enjoy different views in different seasons. It's a nice area to visit and take a few snapshots during the shopping with friends!
48,3.0,"I used to visit Ehwa Univeristy to go shopping whenever I visited Seoul. This was my favorite place to hang out to buy clothes and accessories. However, I stopped going when it got popular with the tourists as it gets too crowded and the shops are not as unique as it used to be. The best years of my life shopping at Ehwa was the late 90's to early 2000's. I recently visited since my cousin attends school there and got to see how different it looks now. I guess times have changed and I moved on..."
49,4.0,"It is a nice place to shop cosmetics and any skin products with lowest price compare to myeondong shopping street or else. But children won't like this place 😁because mommies won't stay just for one or two hours in this place, a whole day won't be enough too"
50,3.0,"It's something u will never get to see in Singapore.  It's a womans university but it looks like a tourist spot with so many ppl taking pictures outside.  We did not venture in further, took pictures with the kids and left after 30 mins."
51,5.0,"Beautiful architecture, breezy and traditional meets modern building. Picturesque and beautiful scenery. Many shops and great shopping nearby."
52,5.0,Ewha Womans University is a most beautiful university in Seoul. And there are many shop for shopping. There are cheap and very cheap.
53,4.0,"People talking Ewha in Seoul, it equates with a designated elite class of young ladies in S. Korea, with high academic standard, social status, and privileged status from the mass. Most parents spending most of their resources hopping to send their daughters into the university. Outsiders are not allowed going into the campus area, and just allowed to visit glance around the front park, buildings and a cafe at the reception park. But you might already be influenced by the ambience and surroundings, and pushed to take lots of photos. There are more than 30+ cafe just sitting outside the entrance of the university, and with several streets crowed with street hawkers. A good place to go in Seoul."
54,4.0,Just take a subway to Ewha Woman’s University Station (Line 2) Exit #2. There are shops everywhere along the busy road. You can also go into the university to have a look
55,4.0,"Ewha Womans University is a huge university and is an ideal place for photograph. However, do check out the timetable there and avoid the students. Basically, it is just a university and nothing much different. There are only tourists without students if you go during the wrong timing. The Ewha Womans University Shopping Street outside is definitely better."
56,4.0,"Ewha Womans University has a beautiful campus that is fun to walk around. Possibly their main attraction is a ramp downstairs that leads to a huge stairwell back up. It is quite impressive, and fun to take photos around. I did not enter any of the buildings, aside from the shops lining the aforementioned ramp/steps. So I can not talk about the interiors, or classrooms. Oh- if you want to save the calorie burning, there is an elevator that takes you from the bottom of the ramp up to the top of the stairs area. The elevator is inside the glass building housing the shops!It was neat to walk around and see university students in another country. The surrounding area has well-priced clothing and make-up shops. Definitely worth checking out, as walking around is free. But if you miss it, don't beat yourself up."
57,5.0,Ewha Womans University is easily accessible by subway train. There are plenty of street food to be savoured. Must try the Beansbins Coffee ice-cream waffle.
58,3.0,The signs ask you to politely refrain from visiting unless you are a student. So if you are a bit naughty you can still have a little bit of a wander to see the older buildings.
59,3.0,"This university is faamous not only for the enviroment, it is also the surrounding area has lots of restaurant and cafes as well as shops. Don't miss out all the shops... just can't stop crzay shopping."
60,4.0,We probably did most of our shopping here. There are so many stores along the Ewha Womans University street. The deals are amazing as well!
61,5.0,A very beautiful uni built on a hill so you need to go up lots of stairs if you want to see all the buildings. The street leading to it are full of shops that sell cheap clothes and shoes. lots of things to eat. a small park where you can rest and refresh.
62,4.0,Was amazed that so many tourist flocked to visit Ewha Woman's University the whole's largest female uni & one of the most prestigious uni in South Korea. It is located in a small town very much like in England. Spend some time to the University Museum - it's free entry.
63,4.0,"Well, I was there for a conference so we got to walk around the area and use facilities indoors. Area is lovely designed, and architecture is really awesome. Peaceful, clean and nice outing"
64,4.0,"If you love to visit a good place and good-designed building, you should go here! Not only take photos but along the street you can shop and eat a good stuff and food. For women you will love here you will find the cheap and nice clothes and skincare product all day and night."
65,4.0,"there are many stores selling beauty products, tibits, shoes, bags, and accessories. There are also cheap eats along the road. A few reasonably priced restaurants around the corner as well."
66,3.0,"Visited this famous campus and while it is no doubt, one of the most beautiful campus, the area is just too small for me to make an effort to come here just to visit. Spend more time around the campus if you're into woman's fashion, sweet shop ... basically, everything woman related"
67,4.0,"We went there by cab and stop right in front of the university. Pity we did not explore the campus though but the area was good for shopping and more so if you are on a Budget. You can find some street kiosk selling food and some cafes here and there. Of course, not to mention Korea cosmetic stores that you can practically see it everywhere you go."
68,4.0,"This place is huge and filled with students. The surrounding areas are worth a walk around, especially up the slope to the church. There are plenty of eating and shopping places around too."
69,5.0,"I went here because I read that it was a great place to shop. We taxied here and didn't visit the actual woman's university (though I hear it is lovely), but instead shopped and ate around the university. Because we were next to a college, the prices were definitely lower than we saw elsewhere in South Korea. There were also tons of clothes and shoes and beauty stores. Since I'm a plus-size gal, I wasn't able to buy any clothes as the sizes probably went up to a Medium/Large max (US size). However, there were tons of a food stalls and restaurants so we ate a lot (there's a little old lady who made really delicious takoyaki). The whole shopping area is maybe 3x3 blocks. However, it is very steep. So I highly recommend starting at the top and work your way down. My mother had a hard time walking at some point and had to take a break."
70,5.0,Very beautiful university..  For Ewha Street..Best ever!.. I bought a coat..very nice autumn coat at very reasonable price..so many clothing stores.. trendy fashion..suitable for teenagers and shopaholic too..
71,4.0,"Lots of cute stationary stuff and of course, the young ladies of Seoul are everywhere. Mesmerizing architecture, East-meet-West and make sure you visit the famous Ewha University's terrace. Enjoy the sunbath especially in winter is surprising pleasing. A buzzing place to visit."
72,5.0,"My family enjoyed strolling through the street foods as soon as we exit the station and walking towards Ewha Women's University Campus.There are lots of shops along, on your left and right side of the road. Shoes, hair saloon, clothes & some branded name retailers.We were amazed at the architecture of the Campus, with classic & modern design infused together.Lovely place to visit!Tips to the venue:- Go to Station Ewha Women Uni,exits # 2 & 3.- 5 mins walk."
73,5.0,"This university has many beautiful grounds for photo shoots. I'm especially attracted to the stairsway and I think our whole family can spend half a day here. Other than that, the best part of visiting here is the food and shopping area just right outside the university. Pretty good for a campus life."
74,5.0,Lovely place to spend the morning and/or afternoon on a cool Dec winter. Lots of shops to put into practise your bargaining skills!.Always found it enjoyable to walk the streets & lanes with the kids while wifey goes around searching for a good bargain. Had a nice toast & coffee with both my son & daughter at Isaac's Toast which lies smack in the middle near to where the area selling shoes are located. Strongly recommend this place whenever you're in Seoul ...
75,5.0,Very cheap food and cheap clothing and shoes. Juno hair was also their and three of our family member had our hair cut. Very professional hair stylist and the saloon was very big with many hair stylists.
76,5.0,"A very nice place to take photo , love the architect building ,shops and eateries nearby. Easily accessible by subway"
77,5.0,"This University resides along a very trendy street. It is opened to public and we spent the time enjoying the scene and taking pictures around the campus. You will see may tourist who came especially to visit this place.My parents enjoy the view very much. out of the campus, you will see a lots of small shops along the street. There are lots of trendy accessories, clothes, shoes and bags for the ladies."
78,5.0,"I've been here twice, spring and autumn.   And I would say, it's one of the must attraction in Seoul.  After a round at the university grounds, shopping area is just a stone throw away.  Got hungry? No problem!  Lots of restaurants to choose from."
79,5.0,"Due the fact that our daughter is studying in that particular university we spent hours walking up and down in the campus area having once a birthday party outside. We found campus to be a peaceful place with old and modern architecture, places for picnic etc. Happy to having been able to see this historically special university."
80,4.0,I've read and heard how interesting this place is in terms of its architecture and grounds.  My family visited in autumn and the place was breath-taking.  Colorful Autumn leaves enhances the beauty of the architecture of the university.  We spent about 2 hours in this place.  My mum is in her eighties and we pushed her round on a wheelchair.  I was very happy to note that the place is wheelchair friendly. Do pop into the University to check out their extensive gym and facilities.   There's lots of cafes nearby to enjoy a relaxing day after walking the grounds.
81,5.0,"This was my first time to visit this uni, but was excited to see it because of all the pictures I've seen. I love how huge and clean the campus is, the architecture made of glass is perfect for a photoshoot. The buildings are like those in Europe, it made my heart leaped and just tried to take it all in. It was definitely an eye candy.I couldn't imagine how it's like to be a student there, I would love to hang out on those steps while studying or just roam around and sit on the wooden benches. Perfect also was the weather when we went there.BUt I noticed there were a lot of tourists roaming around taking pictures so I dont know If some students/classed were disrupted because of this.Shopping is also perfect for tourists after roaming the campus. They said Ewha is already cheap when it comes to shopping but I find the coats still expensive but designs were really nice. It's soo confusing what to get because they really have a great selection. Truly Koreans are very fashionable.There are also restaurants in the street.better spend the morning in the campus cause not much tourists then shop afterwards."
82,5.0,"best, best, best and awesome place to be with.. around the area, so many street shops to go and super duper cheap."
83,5.0,Good place to visit with lots of little food stalls along the streets.  Lots of shops and cheap cosmetic shops.
84,5.0,"Beautiful and easily accessible campus. A combination of old and modern buildings. Vey clean. Awesome. Shopping district is just outside the campus. Plenty of choices from food, apparels, facial products etc. Highly recommend to visitors. Visited this place twice during our 1-week visit."
85,4.0,There were so many alleys of shops! Very youthful district as many teenagers frequent the place. Prices of clothes were very cheap and nice variety!
86,4.0,"Fashion outfit from head to toe,you can find it in this women street.Cosmetic,bags,shoes,socks,hair accessories and etc are all here.Normally tourists will get more free sample if you purchase from the skincare/cosmetic shop.Promoters here can speak several language so you have no worry to communicate. You can get some local snack food around the street or you can even dine in,the price of meal isn't too expensive because it mainly served the campus ladies here. It is better to shop in evening time because the weather is cooler ^^ Daytime is hot and you will prefer to shop in the mall."
87,5.0,Impressed with the grounds of the University..fantastic architecture....good Food hall within the campus..do visit their hall at the main entrance..the History is literally written on the wall...
88,5.0,"The university is not just the only attraction in this area. There are also shopping stores, if you like to watch cinema there are a lot in the area, and food stalls. The prices are very affordable since there are a lot of students in the vicinity."
89,4.0,"We found this place by accident while looking for something else. The grounds are beautiful and worth spending some time to just enjoy the views. Like other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of great places to take pictures here. The shops around the area are also touristy and fun but not necessarily the cheapest. I didn't visit any of the clothing shops but from the other reviews, sounds like those are at good prices. It was a bit crowded when we visited but that just added to the charm. And of course, there is plenty of street food to enjoy. I had my 14 year old son with me and he wasn't exactly thrilled but then again, he's a 14 year old boy. The street food kept him happy though."
90,4.0,"We were there during spring, Apr 24 to be exact. You can get super cheap clothings there! 5000won for a shirt and 5000won for skirts - nice looking ones. The ladies in my family regretted not visiting this place earlier. Also I want to recommend one restaurant, not a well known one, that serves superb food. We stumbled upon it on our search for lunch and since most of our family members fell sick (caught a cold) we had to look for something hot and soupy.We were so happy with the food that we requested to pack their banchan (consist of squid and all good things), which is the cook's own recipe and her kimchi. All of the things we ordered we devoured happily. The price was very reasonable, the cheapest we encountered by far. bibimbap, kalguksu is 5000won,the most expensive thing is 7000won which is the bbq beef. The restaurant is a small one, probably able to seat only 40 persons comfortably but it is a cozy one. Please note that this is according to the tongues of 11 persons who unanimously agreed it was good, but that was our personal taste. but if you are there, walk into Ewhayeodae 5-gil (at the yellow Taco&Rice shop) and you will see Eoma son kalguksu (in Korean language-but you can refer to the pictures i posted). The staff in there can speak little to none English so if you can read Korean it would be helpful and if you cant, they are very patient with you and will try to assist you in ordering."
91,4.0,Nice place to shop with most items priced at 10K won. The streets are not too crowded with lots of small shops to browse around and also lots of eateries and cafes along the streets. Nice view all around the Uni. Good place to walk around if you don't like to shop.
92,5.0,The campus itself is already a tourist attraction.  Very clean... visited around spring and I was in awe...
93,5.0,"The architecture is very different, but get away from the buildings a bit and go up the hill - some remarkable Magnolia trees."
94,5.0,"The campus is beautiful, made me want to go back to school. The street food outside the university entrance is great and the shopping around the university is better than any of the markets."
95,5.0,"There are many cafes and restaurants around the University. Do check out Isaac Toast, they served great breakfast.Many ladies fashion shops offering cheap steals."
96,5.0,I love love love the University itself! The architecture is amazing! It was really nice to people watch here. Some parts of the University were open for visitors and others were not. I did not pass up the chance to shop a little at the new building's optical shop. Stores surrounding the University were also awesome and varied. I really liked shopping cosmetics here more than in Myeongdong because price was the same but with less people around. Also found a cosmetic shop nearby that has more affordable price elsewhere. You also won't go hungry because street food stalls can be found around.
97,4.0,"The surroundings of the campus were clean and the buildings were remarkable. It seems like a condusive learning environment. The students facilities were good. After strolling around the university,we went shopping around the area. There were many cosmetic shops and women's items with reasonable prices.There was a small shop that sells good churros for 2000 won."
98,5.0,Great place for photo-taking as the modern and old buildings in the university campus contrasts one another beautifully.There is also a shopping area near the university with trendy fashion for youngsters.
99,5.0,"From the subway, the beautiful walk down the street to Ewha Women's University immediately signalled that this is going to be a beautiful afternoon.The designer styled multi-purposed building housed auditoriums, bookshops, food courts, and Starbucks. All these blended perfectly in the scenic background spotted with old European styled school buildings.The students dressed in their fashionable wardrobe is another sight to behold......"
100,4.0,"I didn't visit the campus, but I know there's a lot of cheap shoes there so shoes lover please come here. But when I went the I didn't really see lots of clothes, weird."
101,4.0,"The stuff sold around the area here are nice and relatively cheaper, as compared to more overrated and tourist-catered areas, eg. Dongdaemun"

There is a particular outlet operated by a tall build man, you can see weights on the floor of his shop, he has a very bad attitude even if its the last piece, he will just pack it for you without asking you, and he will snatch the bag from your hands to hang the bag back to its original place.This shopping street is relatively small compared to DDM. But the items sold are pretty nice. Mainly for females! Bags & Shoes & Clothings! There are also male fashion shops here but lesser."

Furthermore, the place has a wide variety of shopping, food and beverage outlets right outside. Make this one of the stops when you visit Seoul if you want to feel like a Uni student.I'm not sure if visiting on the weekday is any different but as I went on a weekend, it was pretty crowded when I reached at about 3-4pm. Many locals and visitors alike were about the grounds having picnics or just walking about. If you're looking for a quieter atmosphere, try to visit earlier on the morning."

There are some cafes and food stalls selling egg bread and delicious rice cakes. Love the atmosphere. One will definitely enjoy shopping from stall to stall and store to store along the narrow alleyways. Will come here again when we visit Seoul next time!"

We found a leather shop selling hand made leather bags, book covers etc. in one of the alleys - the shop is CIRO. The price in extremely reasonable. Almost everything that young girls love can be found here -  from bags, boots, clothes, accessories, skincare. The girls did not want to go home! A must place to go for teenagers!"
