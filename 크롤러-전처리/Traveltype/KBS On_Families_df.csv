1,5.0,"KBS broadcasting company has an interactive areas where visitors are allowed. Outside of the KBS building, you can see live radio broadcasting through large windows. We saw Cho,Sung Mo that day. We walked at our leisure and took photos with the poster of Song, Joong Ki from Descendants of the Sun at the lobby. There are many staged areas and we had the most fun in front of the blue screen. We enjoyed our time there!"
2,4.0,"An interesting place with indoor folk villages, streets and buildings from the 1960's to the later Chosun dynasty. Ceiling lights galore, a room full of fake body parts, posters of heroines and heroes of Korean dramas, large photos of honored actors/actresses.Special effects like miniature shooting, blasting scene, underwater shooting."
3,3.0,"I'm a fan of KBS Korean dramas however I find this KBS On Experience Hall to be just average. I was actually more interested in the main KBS building. HahaAdmission is free to this KBS On Experience Hall and you're free to tour the place yourself if you come in group of less than 10 people. Otherwise you need to make reservation through their website. Learn and see the history of broadcasting, high-tech virtual studio, cartoon dubbing corner, mini broadcasting museum, news 9 presenter experience and so much more. I, myself found the news 9 presenter experience to be the most interesting. Who doesn't want to be a news anchor?"
