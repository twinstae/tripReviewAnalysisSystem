0,5.0,We saw the two statues and decided to explore further.  Lovely little find - on our way to Gyeongbukgong Palace  - all underground - and a great experience to learn more about Seoul's history.  A great surprise and really fascinating!

2,4.0,"We visited this place after seeing the King Sejong statue. It is a small place, you can visit it for 1 hour. We learned about the history of hangeul and our kids tried to write her name using hangeul. Then we got into the ship. It was good to look around. We tried to construct the ship by using the blocks.Overall, it was nice to visit here and it was warm"
3,5.0,"Both are great figures of South Korea, so be sure to stop by here to learn about their great contributions to the nation. The exhibitions are great, along with videos with subtitles about these two. The exhibitions are interactive, beautiful and clearly depict the stories."
4,4.0,"The experience here lies somewhere between a museum and a single exhibit. It's worth a walk-through, if only to experience the miniature turtle ship (which was fascinating for me). And it's free, which is always wonderful.Admiral Yi Sunshin is one of Korea's foremost military heroes, and the decisive battle for which he's best associated, the Battle of Myeongnyang in 1597, really is an amazing display of seamanship and sheer courage. Here you'll learn about the specifics, view relics of the era, and read various details of the Joseon Dynasty and its wars.Recommended, especially for military-history buffs."
