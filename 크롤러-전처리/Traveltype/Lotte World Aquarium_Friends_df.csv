0,5.0,"Went here with a couple of friends, all in our twenties. We all thought it was an amazing time. We paid 60.000 won (50â‚¬) each, for a package deal including the aquarium, lotte tower and lotte world. And even though all three are worth a visit, the aquarium was the best. Having some great displays of fish and other animals like penguins, otters and whales.The aquarium is in the same building as the lotte tower, and mall. Which are both enormous, with tons of stores and restaurants."
1,5.0,I was pleasantly surprised to find that this aquarium offered so many different species! It is really well put together and the staff was very friendly.
2,5.0,It was so nice and beautiful to see the variety of sea life.  I most enjoyed the Beluga exhibition and the feeding of the fish with bottles.  Try to avoid times when there are field trips by elementary groups because it can be quite loud and the groups overtake each viewing area.
3,5.0,Ive never been to aquarium like Lotte World Aquarium before. Its size is awesome and there are various fish and whales. I was very excited at that time like a child. The happiest thing was that I got discount like 20% off! I thought the admission fee is a bit expensive to me cause Im a student. I remember the original price is 31000 korean money but I paid just 24800 korean money thanks to Visit Korea Mastercard. I could enjoy the experience with discount admission fee.
4,4.0,"it is inside a shopping mall and boy, the place is so huge that my feet were aching from all the walking. The area was well-kept and the marine animals look so happy!the star of the aquarium was dugong and they were seen playing happily with balls and swimming around the huge tank. they appeared to be smiling and at times, they are seen swimming near to the visitors posing for photo takingthere are also quite a few backdrops for visitors to take photos, e.g. since i went during autumn and close to halloween, there is a backdrop that decorated with halloween pictures and items and another backdrop we saw is decorated with autumn related items. i think it is a wonderful idea. i saw many families with kids & couples are posing with the beautiful decorated backdrops.there is also a small section for kids or anyone to do a touch/free of the starfish or other small marine creatures and dont worry about getting your hands dirty as there are washing basins with soaps right next to it!as compared to S.E.A. aquarium that we have in Singapore Sentosa, i think this Lotte World Aquarium is much more fun. or maybe it's just me.. :)There is also ample of space that is friendly for strollers, families and couples..i would definitely recommend this place to my friends"
