1,5.0,"It was an interesting experience, buying fresh beef from the butchers on ground floor and having them take us to a BBQ place upstairs to grill the meat. It seemed pretty daunting at first.. as we wondered which cuts to get and whether we would get ripped off. However, everything fell into place. The butchers were very friendly and they recommended a beef set with a variety of cuts, all of which tasted so good (particularly the flat iron steak). We ended up having one of the best meals of our trip and will definitely go back again."

We managed to get a decent deal for a Korean platter and enjoyed the platter at a BBQ restaurant upstairs from the meat shop. The beef was so delicious. Even with the service fees at the restaurant, the total price of our dinner was still like 30-40% cheaper than the korean beef places in the city. Highly recommended."
3,5.0,"This place was recommended by some folks from Hong Kong as a great way to get top quality beef at a low cost.  Find a vendor (preferably one who sells the top grade of beef), choose what cuts you want, have them slice it, then take it upstairs to do Korean BBQ on their grills.  The beef was awesome.  They do supply some side dishes with the Korean BBQ.  Getting there was pretty easy.  Take the #5 line to Majang (station 541), walk straight, take the first left.  Then walk past the elementary school several blocks, and follow your nose to the indoor market on the right.  Wash the beef down with some good Korean soju."

Though not a beef connoisseur, my discerning taste buds is pretty good at sussing out a quality piece of beef than a poor quality piece. Because this is a meat market, the eateries selling beef here offer inexpensive beef for the BBQ which Koreans adore. The beef is average tasting for what you pay. I have been to other meat markets, like the famous one in Kichijoji......so Majang Market was a tad disappointing. Fortunately, I did not suss this place out. Friends suggested this place and led me there. One of those social gatherings that necessitates being a carnivore. We arrive in the evening & walked past rows & rows of closed shops with the heavy smell of fresh meat in the air. It must be pretty bustling in the day time. We headed straight to the cooked food street and enter one of the eateries. It was crowded with locals. We ordered the set that is the top of the range and different types of beef, and BBQed the beef sitting on the floor.  It was very very very ordinary.I doubt I will travel out to Majang market for BBQ :( I rather pay a little more for convenience and better quality beef in town......especially since i have limited appetite for beef. So it better be ......goooooood."

Then bring it to a near by restaurant and pay a small fee of 5000-6000 Son to cook your meat. Store owners provides Ban Chan (side dish) to go with your meat. You will not regret after visiting this place."
7,4.0,"This is a well known area for selling meat. Most stores sell beef for BBQ. Different portions are packed for different number of people. The interesting part is that the customer can purchase the beef downstairs and take it up to the restaurants to BBQ. If you don't want to choose, there is the local BBQ alley with a number of BBQ restaurants. Portions can be huge. Negotiate for discounts."
8,4.0,"I came here because I want to try fresh meat right from its first hand since I read some reviews that this market is one of the biggest supplier for meat all across Seoul. It's quite hard to find this place since it's located quite far from subway station. But just ask the people you meet and they'll surely help you :)I asked some sellers to get best meat with best price and ended up buying 500gr of A++ grade hanwoo (Korean beef) with 45000won. It might be quite expensive but you wont get this price in another place in Seoul right? dont forget to bargain and ask for some meat for bonus ;)After you got your meat, tell the seller that you want to grill the meat and they'll take you to the restaurant nearby to grill the meat. You only have to pay 5000won for rice, grilling the meat and unlimited vegetables wrap and banchan (korean side dish). The meat was really tender and delicious :"")Hanwoo is indeed popular for being sooo expensive yet so tender, so make sure you try hanwoo once you're coming to Korea."

We bought the meat we liked and then took it to one of the restaurants upstairs, they provided the grill and side dishes at a cost. We also had the korean style raw beef w/ egg and pear, which costed an extra 5000won for the ahjummas to prepare. If you are a group of 6 people of more, some restaurant charge a cheaper price per person."
