1,5.0,"This isn't just another fireworks festival. In fact, it is one that you should really come and experience for yourself.The Seoul International Fireworks Festival usually takes place around early October, but the date changes every year, so do search it up on Google to find out the exact date.I strongly recommend attending this festival because you are sure to enjoy it and have a lot of fun. The fireworks display is amazing as it is spectacular, and there are even some sequences where the fireworks are released according to the music that is played in the background. You'll love it.The atmosphere is really lively too. The Koreans are the bunch who will cheer as the fireworks light up the sky, and that makes it really fun as everyone is just in the mood and enjoying the display.Even though the opening ceremony officially starts at 7pm, do head down to Yeouido Hanging Park as early as 4pm to get a good spot in the park. If you don't have a picnic mat or food to eat, don't worry, as there will be people selling these items nearby and inside the park. I do recommend getting fried chicken and cola to enjoy while waiting or enjoying the fireworks display - it is great picnic food.To get to the park, take exit 4 of Yeouinaru Station (Seoul Subway Line 5)."
