0,5.0,"CC ( 19.02.16 ) I and my son visited this museum to know more about enforced sex slaves by Japan. No photo inside, and had many exhibit about enforced sex slaves in WW II. The exhibits was more terrible than I think, and I felt sorry for women in these times. The inside was a little small, but well-managed. In some area, special exhibit was held about Vietnamese women's victim who was harmed in Vietnam War by Korean soldier. I felt sorry, too. Without considering national benefit and nationality, we don't forget and must console about innocent people who had much pain."
1,4.0,Worth a short visit. Intro film and exhibits were interesting. Staff were friendly and informative. Located in a small but quaint town with an interesting main street.
2,3.0,"The museum has an important purpose and a precautionary tale of the evils of war.  Neither our taxi driver nor the concierge in our hotel had ever heard of this museum, and the location seemed like an hour from anywhere else you would rather be in Korea - but the visit was important to one person in our party and for that reason we all went.  It will not be everyone's cup of tea.  But I suppose you don't have to drink tea to know that it exists. The museum highlights a terrible aspect of war - one that has not been formally recognized by the Japanese governments.  There are funds being raised for the victims, but it seems that the victims are not seeking compensation from donors but recognition of what happened and how awful it was - and by extension how terrible that it is as it continues to happen in other wars.  Not a happy visit - but there is a message in there somewhere."
3,5.0,"This museum does a good job of presenting a dark piece of the history between Japan and Korea, and honoring the women who finally told their stories. I was astounded to learn that the victims did not disclose their abuse for over 40 years, and I did not know that numerous sites throughout Asia were used by the Japanese. This is a must-see museum for anyone who cares about human rights and women's rights."
4,4.0,"I went to this place with my wife and teenage daughter, and it was a truly meaning visit for all of us.  It's a small but valuable museum mainly focusing on victims of sex slavery by the Japanese before and during the World War Two, still an ongoing heated issue yet to be settled.However, the museum does not intend to provoke a sort of anti-Japanese sentiment often displayed by the Korean nationalists. Instead, the museum calmly and clearly views the issue as the violence against women frequently committed in the wartime. There is also a dedicated section about the wartime sexual violence committed in Kosovo and Congo wars.I hope the museum continues to develop and help reach out to the victims of war crimes in other international conflicts as well."
