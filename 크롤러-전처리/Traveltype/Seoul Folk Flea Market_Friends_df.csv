Most sellers not really good in english so make sure you sharpen up your hanguk tongue to get cheap price. Some people may see this as junk. Well, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Just walkinh distance from dongdaemon."
1,4.0,It's a great place if you like collecting old/antique stuff. Or if you want to find something unique as decoration for your shop/cafe/room. And it's located not far from Sinseoldong station.

It's a great way to blow a couple of hours in the afternoon - if you've seen all the palaces, temples, and better city markets. The flea market is quite big, and bigger on the weekend. On the weekend, there are vendors all around the building and in the streets. The quality of these goods is of dubious value. Look quickly, don't buy or pick anything up. If you don't speak the language, you could get harangued into buying something. Go inside the complex and look at the antique section on the right side of the first floor. The stuff is quite interesting and you might just pick up something you like. There are food stalls in the back that serve quite tasty treats (no western food at all - its all Korean). Walk around the other floors and you won't be disapointed. Honestly, its very similar to any flea market in America. A mix of ""one man's treasure"", knock-off clothing products, old stuff passing as treasure, and household goods being traded from one garage to another."

I would be there at least every month, if I was living in Korea.Take some time to walk around the building for there are many regular people, not business people, selling their stuff. Also, for the high rollers, there is an auction place right beside it.Go there, talk to people, get to know the culture, have fun!"
