0,5.0,"Right opposite of City Hall, this is the smallest palace in Seoul- small an cute but like its other palaces, a very sad history due to the Japanese occupation. Not too visited by tourists so it is very very peaceful and not crowded. Very clean grounds and neat to have it smack in the city, the palace makes a good starting point to learn about the history of the country. Walkable and well-located, if you are by City Hall and you have time then visit the palace ( get a group ticket to save money instead of buying individual palace entrances)."
