0,5.0,I enjoyed going to Grevin. The wax figures were very well done and there was a lot to see. They were divided up by theme rooms. I wish I would have went with someone. I could only take selfies which was hard. I recommend taking a friend if you want to take pictures with the figures. I also liked the interactive exhibits.
1,5.0,I had great experience exploring the museum. Was able to discover alot and know famous people around the world.. the best part was the last part indeed. Hoping that they can add BTS on the entertainment section so that I can see them on the next visit but overall it was indeed a good experience.
2,5.0,I had an awesome time in the museum! The figures were all very well done and there were many activities to do. The sets were well done with music adding to the environment in each room. Well worth the visit!
3,4.0,"Was hoping for more wax figures of kpop and kdrama celebrities. When I visited alone, there were only 2 other visitors. During the initial phase of the visit, a staff was tasked to follow me around, supposedly to guide me on the rules, etc. However, at one point, when I turned around to look for her, she was nowhere found in sight - she had left without informing me, leaving me alone, surrounded by the wax figures; that really crept me out. It wasn't until a while later when I ran into the other 2 visitors when the ambiance became a lot more pleasant. But overall, it was interesting, and I was glad that I visited."
4,4.0,"Employees kept following me around for almost the entire duration I spent there. It made it really awkward to take photos... If I moved to one side of the room, they slowly walked over, and if I looked at the employees, then they would casually glance elsewhere. Smh, I wasn't going to destroy their museum or take dirty photos. Just a foreigner trying to enjoy the museum like everyone else is. Employees are creepier than the wax figures."
5,5.0,"It was nice to see the museum. Really liked the part of airplane section. Also, you can have various experiences just by scanning your ticket in each sections"

9,5.0,Grevin is located near Starbucks near the City Hall station On line 1. I did not expect the museum to have such a huge variety of wax statues of famous people from around the world. What took me by surprise was seeing Meryl Streep's statue here. It's a must visit if you're eager to see statues of your favourite kdrama and kpop actors / singers.The souvenir shop is really good btw :)))
