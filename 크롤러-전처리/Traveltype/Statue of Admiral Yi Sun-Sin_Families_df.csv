The statue shows the Admiral in a standing posture, holding a sword in his right hand the face depicting the determination of a soldier.Near the statue there is a miniature turtle ship representing the war vessel which the Admiral supposed to have commanded during the war. There is also a small museum in the memory of the Admiral.Also in front of the statue there is a water fountain called 23.12 representing the 23 wars the Admiral won with 12 warships."
1,4.0,This is an impressive statue located in the centre of the city and the great thing about it is that there is a museum underground here where you can also learn so much about Korean history. The statue is very close to the statue of Sejong the Great and also walking distance to Gyeongbokgung Palace.Another great feature here is the water fountain in the evening time. The fountain is lit up and changes colour all the time and here you will always find kids playing in the fountain. My own young kids insisted to come here several times.

His come commemorative statue is rightly placed in front of King Sejongâ€™s statue who is in front of the palace, being the first to face any oncoming enemy. A special pedestrian street is built in the middle of the road where these statues are placed. Very powerful statement. When we were there, tents have also been set up along this street bringing awareness and prevention of desertification."

5,3.0,"This hero status is situated on the center of the Main Street. Aside from Admiral Yi Sun-Sim, the Emperor Statue is also placed in the same area.It was nice to get a glimpse of such height of statue in a busy street near the Palace.It was a coincidence when we visited as it was also the Celebration date of the Year of the Policeman. So there is a lot of man in uniforms. We decided to leave early seeing the crowd is increasing by the minute. If anyone asked me if this place if worth a visit? I would say yes if you are already visiting the palace. It was just 600 meters walk from the Palace museum."
