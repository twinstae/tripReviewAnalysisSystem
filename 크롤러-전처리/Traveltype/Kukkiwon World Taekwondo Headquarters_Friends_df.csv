0,5.0,A wonderful institute established by Kukkiwon to promote globally the Korean tradition of Taekwando. They have a museum and cafetaria for visitors to explore. They also regularly organize international competition and demonstrations of Taekwando. It was an amazing experience participating in the September 2016 festival. I got to see the talented competitors of all age groups from different nations participating. Several nations also presented tradition dances and had their food stalls during this festival.
