It offered restaurants, shopping and really cool street performance (similar as Hongdae). We actually ended up listening to opera which was cool. Wouldn’t spent a whole day here, but definitely a couple of hours."
1,5.0,Visited Sinchon on our last night in Seoul. It’s a great place to shop and dine. Not so crowded as Myeongdong. Lots of dining choices. Love the live performances at night
2,4.0,"Around Sinchon you can find a strip of street food, bars, clubs, traditional restaurants, and arcades. It's perfect if you want to avoid foreigners, mostly locals in this area. Although a great selection things to do late at night, there tends to be a lot of S. Koreans drinking beyond  their limit to blow off work steam and consequently friends carrying each other home. Completely, safe, but not best environment for a romantic stroll nor to bring young kids."

8,4.0,"Sinchon is one of the most lively district in Seoul, lots of universities, restaurants, pubs and cafes, a very youthful atmosphere. Accessible thanks to the large network of underground trains. If you plan to spend the night here I suggest you to go somewhere..there is not much."
