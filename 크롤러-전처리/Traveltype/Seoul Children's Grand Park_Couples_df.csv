0,5.0,"Seoul Children Grand Park is a good place to see Cherry Blossom on April. Crowd but the space is big enough for you to take a rest, eat some snacks, sit in the grass and enjoy the beautiful Cherry blossom! There is also a zoo inside the park!~ Recommend visit on April^^"
1,4.0,2nd largest park in seoul. Many activities and sights to enjoy all for free! For amusement park you gotta pay but i don't really recommend you. Others are mostly free and just clean and wonderful place to visit. Especially its real beauty on march to april due to flower season
2,4.0,"CY ( 2016.04.09 ) This park was established long time ago, so the facility was a little old. But this place was good to us because we have visited in childhood. There had amusement park, zoo, and picnic place. As compared with another big amusement park, there was small but free. On a fine day, there was very good place to walk in downtown. We visited for seeing cherry-blossom, that's great."
3,4.0,"It was a great zoo, especially with kids. It was overcrowded when we were there, so we didn't stay longer than 3-4 hours. The park is BEAUTIFUL, especially in Fall-huge, well-maintained, with plenty of trails for walking between the animals.  You'd have to come back more than once to see the whole place."
4,4.0,"It amazes me to see any one or two-star reviews about this place. I guess you can't please everyone. However, I really enjoyed taking my girlfriend here. We were able to see some cherry blossoms, check out some animals, and walk through the botanical gardens. Despite it being a drizzly day, we had a great time. It's a wonderful place to have a picnic, take your family, or have a date. You can buy some snacks there or bring your own food. Maybe it's not an amazing park like you would see in London but I think it's a fun place and you don't have to pay anything to get in."
