0,3.0,"Though reconstructed several times throughout its 700 year history it is a magnificent monument to the Joseon Dynasty. Though inspiring from street level, it is even more impressive from the lounge or roomss facing from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square."
1,5.0,Great place to take a picture and admire the architecture. It is just across the street from the metro and near department stores and close to the clothing market.
2,4.0,"We did not have chance to visit during the day so popped by in the evening to wander around the outside. It was beautifully lit up and looked magnificent. It is a little tricky to get over to, due to its location in the middle of a busy road, but was worth being patient for. Impressive!"
3,5.0,"Dongdaemun is a wonderful area in Seoul to explore, one special feature of the area is Heunginjimun Gate or East Gate. This version of the gate was built in 1869, the original was built in 1396 and was the main gate of four of the Seoul City Wall (Hanyangdoseong), it is listed as the National Treasure No.1.  We walked passed the gate after our visit to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park on our way to the Seoul City Wall Museum.  Highly recommend."
4,4.0,"The gate is the only one in Seoul which has a semi circular wall at the back and the image has been on quite a few guidebooks etc. It's a shame you  can't walk through it and can only admire it from outside. If you climb a short distance up along the city walls across the road, you can have quite a nice view of the gate and the design plaza nearby."
5,3.0,This seems strange set on the middle of a road intersectionGiven all the other similar structures in the city you could give it a miss but if you are nearby it is worth a look and a piccy or two
6,4.0,One of the two largest gates in Seoul. It has a stone archway in the retaining wall linked to the city wall and a wooden pavillion was constructed on it. The metro station is very close by.
7,4.0,"Very nice place to visit, also some outlet malls are there and street shopping market, the metro station is very close."
8,5.0,This gate is beautiful.  Not much more to say actually.  It is well preserved and looks good.  But surrounded by modern buildings.  Well worth passing by and take some pics of it.
9,4.0,"Very impressive at night all lit up.  This is only one of the 8 gates of the city.  Out of all the gates I've seen this and the Namdaemun are the most impressive.  10 minutes from the metro station. Head towards Doota, the Big Owl!Be careful crossing the road here as its busy."
10,3.0,"The Dongdaemun Gate stands majestically in striking contrast to its modern surroundings, namely the Dongdaemun shopping district, the busy road intersection and the Dongdaemun Design Plaza. Not as grand as the Gwanghwamun Gate (in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace), but still worth a camera click before you proceed for your shopping in the Dongdaemun malls. For a perfect vantage point of the gate, walk up the hill along the Seoul City Wall."
11,5.0,"Well, u know Dongdaemun is a crowded place, esp the Dongdaemun cultural and history park. Just walk a little bit towards the Dongdaemun, you can have a bit of hiking along the blocks and have a sit ard the green and floral lawn. Takes within half an hour to go up all the way. You can find a cozy coffee shop to take a break, and enjoy a piece of quite near the local residential area on the slope. Highly recommended to visit if you're looking for a relaxing and slightly sporty trip."
12,4.0,It's one of gate of ancient Seoul and also wonderful and especially at night. But it's under construction  and I could see one side of it. I think this gate is the start point to trip to the center of seoul or walk through the route of ancient Seoul fortress wall.
13,3.0,Found the building after coming out from the train station. It is difficult to miss it. The gate is under renovation and you can only take photos from the outside.
14,4.0,It's pretty easy to get here. It's just across the road from Dongdaemun market. Great to see the history of Seoul. Can be a bit touristy. Worth a visit.
15,4.0,"Touted as Korean National Treasure #1 동대문 - 흥인지문 is 1 of the 8 gates protecting ancient Seoul City Wall, what we see now is the Gate w/o the fortress Walls (collapsed or damaged). Also known as the East Gate (Heunginjimon) the gate has a semi-circular protective wall (to protect the gate!).   The gatehouse is a two-story building and the gate features a hipped roof.There is no access allowed beneath the gate arch nor to the arch roof or gatehouse so people can just feels the lower wall and admire the magnificence from a further distance. One can get a photo of the dragon mosaic on the arch roof.  Bullet marks from the Korean war are visible on the lower section of the gate if you view them at close range.The gate is quite in the center of the very busy intersection. It’s magnificent structure grace Seoul's skyline amid the modern bldg. surrounding it.  It is just within 8 mins from our Hotel at Dongdaemun so we walked past it day & night for a good 4-days. To get an independent photo without traffic or people is always a challenge!. Here we share some day & night photos shot. It is close to nearby Dongdaemun design Plaza, dongdaemun market and dongdaemun history & culture museum, ontop of  food shops cafes.  Really great location!We especially love the night charm it exhaulted. Not to be missed…  The architecture of this itself is worth seeing."
16,5.0,"The oldest of the city gates with beautifully exposed city walls has been preserved with the 21st century road system built around it.Stands out loud and proud, adds lots of class to the area."
17,4.0,"Enormous gate where you can also see some of the preserved eastern wall in the  nearby park. The gate is closed so you can't go through it (unlike Namdaemun Gate). In the evening, the lights will show a beautiful view of the gate."
18,4.0,"Seoul has a number of such architecturally significant Gates - a necessity, being a walled city.  They are all a bit different, but worth seeing.  You can also see sections of the wall that surrounded Seoul.We found this one - the East Gate - after an evening walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream.We also found the South Gate - near the Namdaemun market, but regrettably, I didn't get to see any of the others."
19,4.0,The gate is located in a busy junction near Dongdaemun metro station and Dongdaemun Market. Walk up to the hilly park nearby and enjoy the view at night.
20,3.0,We didn’t actually look for the gate but while wandering in Dongdaemun we came across and that was the last picture for that night we took. good for fotos. After that we headed our hotel taking a taxi.Area around is very safe for tourist!
21,4.0,"The gate is very impressive. The size of the lower stones, the bullet marks from the Korean war, and the two dragon mosaic on the ceiling within the gate, are all worth seeing. To get a picture of the dragon mosaic, place you tablet or phone on the stone floor and position it so you see the two dragons. Then place yourself in the picture by looking down at your phone in a corner of the image. The size and grandeur of the gate is impressive. Unfortunately, today its hemmed in by busing city streets. Nevertheless, well worth a visit. It's also close to the Dongdaemun market."
22,4.0,Stunting architecture with great history and huge local shopping district. Cheap and trendy clothing stalls/shops everywhere.
23,5.0,"The gate and nearby city wall are well preserved and worth a look when you visit Dongdaemun.  The city was at one time surrounded by a wall of stone blocks, which was quite high from the outside."
24,3.0,"The gate is still under partial renovation, but it is a historic gate . When I visited there, it was long holidays and no shoppers around ,  I did get some pretty photos of it."
25,3.0,"Like the Namdaemun, this is another historical gate in the middle of an intersection. Apart from a few pictures to say ""I've been to Dongdaemun, and have seen the gate"", there's really nothing much else to see or experience.Of course, as a shopping and eating destination, Dongdaemun ranks quite highly in Seoul, and that I cannot disagree. The Migliore and APM Mall are two malls with good bargains on clothes, bags and shoes, while Doota is a bit more upmarket. Stay till past 9pm to see the street shops up in their full glory, for even more shopping madness."
26,3.0,"The gate is located in the middle of a busy road.It was being partially renovated during our visit in July 2014.The gate itself, while rather big, sort of fails to impress during the day.It is only after dark, when it is dramatically lit, that it seems half decent.A 5-minute visit is all you need."
27,1.0,"Right in the middle of the road is this Dongdaemun Gate. Nothing to see when you go close, so simply take a picture from far and walk off. That's it."
28,3.0,"If you plan on visiting Seoul and taking awesome pictures of the 'gates' that surround the city, I recommend you forgo visiting this one until construction and remodeling efforts are finished.  The local are has lots to offer for entertainment, I am sure once construction is complete this will be an awesome gate to visit."
29,4.0,A beautiful piece of history in Seoul. On the edge of Namdaemun market  which is a must-see  authentic market. We enjoyed hearing about the history of the gate from our tour guide.
