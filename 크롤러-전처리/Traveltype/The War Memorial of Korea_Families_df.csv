0,5.0,This museum was so well done. Very respectful and dignified. There is a new section covering the history of the ROK military including women. A cafe upstairs and down. Great static displays inside and out.
1,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea ..... an educational history lesson. Have not visit museums for sometime, this stood out to be interesting and informative ! It is a beautiful place and definitely worth at least a couple of hours of your time in Seoul...."
2,5.0,A wonderful museum that encompasses thousands of years.Very well done and very surprising that it was free.
3,5.0,"First visited with my 8 year old twins in Sep. Entrance is free. I truly enjoyed the complimentary English tour conducted by a lady in her 70s who lived through the war. Her stories we so captivating and touching I had to hold my tears in many occasions.  We didn’t get to visit the Children’s Museum as it was fully booked but the kids spent more than an hour playing at the play area outside the Children’s museum. They were in awed with the fighter jets and tanks on display. Just visited the museum again today with my 15year old, our English guide today was a 17 year old high school boy. He was well versed with the basic history and professional with the job assigned. However, nothing beats having the story told by one who had first hand experience but it’s not fair to compare with the 17 year old as I think he did put effort to do his best. We spent 3 hours going through all the exhibits with a coffee break in between at the cafe on ground floor. They serve nice coffee, bun with red bean and cream filling and especially love their ciabatta sandwich with chicken and cheese filling. Will go back again for the Children’s museum."
4,5.0,"Carefully architected with a beautiful garden. But most of all, it is an entertaining way to get a better understanding of the North/South Korea cease fire that continues from 1950 up until today.If you have no historical background or if you already know a lot, the setup and displays are intelligently crafted to cater for all type of audiences."
5,5.0,Very educational.on work day wasn’t crowded.loved everything especially outside!lots of pics and fun!
6,5.0,"A huge memorial location with many exhibits to view.Easily a half day tour. Food in the attached restaurant was good and reasonably priced,Well worth a visit."
7,5.0,"Honestly one of the best Museums I have been too! Well spaced out, clean and taken care of. You can feel the respect for their history in the information and atmosphere you see and feel.  No charge but donations welcome. Free English speaking tour at 10am & 1pm, we unfortunately missed those but I have no doubt they would be great.  English signage and leaflets all round, shows/videos and 4D available in English. Toilets on every level and so fresh and clean. The best bit for us was the children’s museum, fantastic interactive areas free of charge for a set 50min.  There is a playground outside for the children to burn off energy and a few cafe to get snacks and ice cream, also blox (Lego) area which looked great but we didn’t use."
8,5.0,Was great to learn so much about the Korean war and the struggle the KoreN people had to go through after that to become who they are right now.
9,5.0,"I was not expecting much about this place, but was surprised to see the indoor and outdoor displays.  They have a lot of tanks, artillery, fighter jets, and even a huge air force B52 bomber on display.  There is also the coast guard cutter that still contains all the holes during the gun fight it had with the north koreans. Even if the AV presentation was in Korean, it provides a detailed blow by blow on the firefight.Very well kept and maintained, which showcases how nationalistic the country is.Well worth a visit even for non Koreans who are history or war buffs."
10,4.0,"The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war. You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived. Certainly in terms of the events of the war, but perhaps more interesting, you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war has had on the people of Korean. Clearly the history and culture of Korean is deeply affected by the divide and you feel you understand this a little better after the visit. If you are interested in military equipment this is definitely also a good place to visit."
11,4.0,"The area is big and there is a lot to see and learn. No entrance fee and you can learn a lot from the exhibit as there are a lot of things to see, hear, and experience. Suggest to put this in your agenda when visiting ROK."
12,4.0,"This place not only documents the Korean war, but also pays tribute to all the nations that sent their sons to fight for the Korean people.  Very moving."
13,4.0,"Very nice to visit if you want to learn about South Korea's history. Lots of military plane, tanks, etc. to see and take pictures here."
14,5.0,This is quite amazing. Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages. there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire. It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military. I was very moved by the memorials outside the museum thanking the different nations helping the people of South Korea.
15,4.0,Originally we did not plant to visit the musem but we were happy that we decided otherwise. We leaned quie a lot about the so called forgotten war and the museum is a good mix of information and memorials. Also the outside part with an actual B52 bomber is worthwhile
16,5.0,"One of the great things about the museum's in Seoul is that most of them are free to include the war Memorial. It's easy accessible by metro, it's huge with great visual history on the inside and has a large park on the outside. It's one of the best museums that I've been to. It's worth putting on the calendar for a visit."
17,5.0,The outside has a large number of exhibits including a huge B-52 bomber. Inside it gives the history of the war and even my youngest child found it interesting and moving.
18,5.0,"One not to be missed, you could spend a whole day here, Well laid out and flow through the different areas. Tell the whole story of the Korean Military and wars. Lots of exhibits to see, emotional in places."
19,5.0,"This is a must-stop for any visit to Seoul. The organization of exhibits and content makes for a powerful and moving presentation. You could spend an entire day, but schedule at least 2 hours."
20,5.0,"The outside is just as good as the inside.  Powerful sculptures, a massive amount of relics, flags and number served from each country, wall of remembrance.  Inside is also great, but if you were on a tight schedule, you could easily walk the outside and grasp the depth of emotions still felt by all Koreans.  My family was very glad we visited this museum."
21,5.0,"As a person without that much knowledge and detail about the Korean War since it is not taught in schools here, this place was great. It is not only informative but it is presented in such a way that it makes you want to learn while still presenting the truths and horrors of wars in general. I'd definitely recommend this place"
22,5.0,"The outdoor military vehicles such as tanker, missile launcher, aircraft and naval vessel were simply amazing. The indoor display of armoury was interesting as well. We spent almost 2 hours touring this free entry museum. Would have spent more time if we were not in a hurry."
23,4.0,"Before visiting, I had the impression it mainly focused on the Korean War. Although that is true, it also has other exhibits that covers history of Korea back to the older empire which was really educational as well."
24,5.0,We have been here a few times and our small children never want to leave. There are plenty of photo opportunities!
25,5.0,"Large volume of indoor and outdoor exhibits showcasing different era of the Korean military warfare, particular focus on the recent Korean war. Impressive, solemn honour of the fallen at the entrance. Highly recommended for those who would like to learn more about this unfinished war. Plan to spend at least half a day."
26,5.0,"We visited this place of interest on a Saturday afternoon, and was surprised it was not crowded at all. We spent some time looking at the tanks, airplanes and ship that were somehow involved in the war.Then we moved to the museum inside. The exhibits were well thought out and well organised. There must be a lot of planning that went into the building and arranging the exhibits. Our regret was that we did not arrive earlier as we had to rush through the museum.This place is a definite “must visit” if you are keen to understand the Korean War, and do allocate sufficient time to explore the museum and watch the various documentaries."
27,5.0,"Such a beautiful memorial to those lost in the Korean War and a history of all of the other wars they have endured.  We were able to see the name of a Soldier who was  from my small Ontario town who was killed in the Korean War.  The sculptures are stunning as is the Rotunda and outdoor area.  Magnificant display of planes , bombs etc.  A must see."
28,5.0,"We went here to go to the museum with our 3 and 5 year old but we just spent over an hour reading all the signs and talking about each aircraft, it’s purpose and the vehicles and their purpose. My kids were absolutely fascinated with them. There were several they were able to go up to via stairs or into via ramp. They loved the high speed vessel though our youngest got scared in the pilot house when the recording came on. Then after visiting all the airplanes and vehicles we found a children’s museum next to and at the war memorial. It was like a children’s war museum. It used sensory (touch, see and feel) to teach them about the war. Then there was a play area and coffee shop at the end but you are limited to 2 hours before they make you leave the museum. Coffee shop was good too."
29,5.0,A solemn place to visit for those interested in happenings of the Korean war. Good history lesson and a solemn reminder that the price of freedom is not free.
30,5.0,"We visites the museum with young children (6 and 9), all of us enjoyed with both indoor and outdoor displays. There are a lot of interactive information board,  usage or technology to showcase,  and most importantly, at least 98% of the exhibits have English explanation."
31,5.0,"Excellent learning about the Korean War in 1950 and how the UN coliation came over to help fight this war. For everyone that didn't go through WW2, this museum is a reminder about how destructive war is on humanity and that we must not go to war ever again. Expect to spend at least 2-4 hours going through the indoor exhibits and the outdoor aeroplanes, helicopters, tanks and boat that were used in the war. Freedom is not free because everyone loses in a war. Many other notable quotes on the walls of the mesuem. Do not miss this museum when in Seoul."
32,5.0,Very interesting to see how Korea views it's military and relationships with other countries.  There was a military parade going on during our visit.  It was in honor of the Veterans.
33,4.0,"Easily accessed by metro Samgakjiyeok. Entrance is free. Site maps in major languages and guided tour in foreign languages available.  Large building but simple layout easy to navigate. I went to exhibition rooms concerning the Korean War. I found them well laid out, adequate English and Chinese translations. Videos were English subtitled only. Only thing lacking is details of human suffering. Exhibits of military hardware was impressive and one can even touch a B-52 bomber! In addition to F-86, P-51, F-4,F-5, MIG15 and 19. There are many tanks too from both sides.  A must for anyone into military history."
34,4.0,"The place is huge both inside and outside. The hall gives honor to all The wars in Korea since The earlier years OF its history. The place was nicely organized and prepared. IT covers all the era from The 4th century onwards. There are exhibits, video presentations and actual War machines inside and outside. The outside has exhibits from The Korean wars OF tanks, planes, Rockets and artillery. A must place to visit in Seoul."
35,5.0,"Before I went here i didn't know much about the Korean war but now I know quite a bit , even better it's free to visit"
36,5.0,"Yes, its free. If you really interest in history please pay a visit here. This is one of the best ""free"" museum i ever visit. Very technology orientated and you can take some photo with plane, helicopter, ......."
37,5.0,Its probably the best war memorial I have ever visited in any city or country.  The eye for detail is exceptional with a huge collection of war memories including a World War II fighter jet !  Highly recommended and dont miss this place if you are in Seoul.
38,4.0,The museum has no fee and has the whole history of Korea represented. It gives for an foreigner and good inside into the Korean history from the countries perspective.Plan minimum half day as it has a lot to see!
39,5.0,"I found the whole Memorial to be absolutely incredible. It's huge too, think how much time you want to give to it. It's not just the Korean War but all the conflict that Korea has had throughout its history right up to the present. When I went through the international recognition (specifically Australian) section of the Korean War room I found myself getting quite emotional."
40,4.0,"I would recommend for those that are into warfares, this is the place to go. We enjoyed it and will take you a few hours to walk and learnt about the history of the Korean War and the wars before. We thoroughly enjoyed it but like I said, only for those into army, warfares, soldiers etc. If not, it will be a boring visit."
41,5.0,"The War Memorial Of Korea was amazing. We learnt a great deal by navigating the many floors that boasted with tons of history. Each step gave ample information about the wars that South Korea endured with its neighbors, especially the war with Japan, China and North Korea.  This visit made me realize the great success that South Korea has achieved in this small window of time. The wars have made it stronger, better and very successful. I couldn't get enough. Just Wonderful. Go Korea!"
42,5.0,"Fantastic museum for all those who love history. To learn more and also to remember those who gave their lives for the ongoing freedom of South Korea from communist infiltration.Well laid out, very respectful to those involved. You can spend hours here."
43,5.0,"It is a huge facility, which will take one whole day or two, to throughly read and visit all the presentations. It is free of charge for entrance, to my surprise. It has a couple of free fun rides and even free movie night. Check the program before visit."
44,5.0,"We thought this place would have a few commemorative statues and exhibits. To our surprise, there were 8 separate memorial exhibits including inside the building. The nearest subway for this is Samgakji."
45,5.0,"Must see place in Seoul, it was a very heart warming experience to see it, very well done and staff there were very nice and helpful"
46,5.0,"it was very huge and had lots of history, loved each section as it gave details on different part of history. Outdoor planes, helicopter, tanks, armored vehicle's and replica of navy ship were displaced. my children loved each bit of it."
47,4.0,I learned more about the war than I had known.  It is a very interesting museum.  I would like to spend more time to see everything.
48,5.0,"This place is huge! I loved the huge, moving statues outside. We couldn't even cover a quarter of the place!"
49,5.0,My 1st time experience going to a war museum indeed it’s a must visit place in Seoul. Pretty cool place wit lots of war machines on display.
50,5.0,"Many visitors from outside of Korea have limited familiarity with the events surrounding the Korean Conflict. This memorial and the museum grounds provide an excellent overview of the sometimes violent history of the Korean Peninsula and specifically the war between the ROK and the DPRK. Like other modern museums, the galleries are organized in a linear fashion, enabling visitors to understand the events leading up to the war as well as critical moments in the conflict. It focuses on both military and civilian experiences and does a very compelling job of narrating the history."
51,5.0,"I went here the first time with my family about one year and a half ago. We loved it! We also saw a demonstration of sorts. It was fantastic! It's like the changing of the guards in Gongbukgyeon palace only with a huge amount of imperial guards with their traditional warrior uniforms and their flags! It was amazing! I thought to myself, I will come back here again in the future. Fast forward to now, I went to visit with my parents this time. We walked the museums and took photos of all the exhibits. And more awesome, they are FREE to see! How cool is that! We didn't see any performances but just to walk around the whole place was a great experience. The Koreans just take pride in their history and they want to share it with the world! We truly appreciate their history and hospitality. We would love to come back again in the future."
52,5.0,"The main attraction is definitely Korean War memorial and they did a great job.  There are lots of valuable documents, items, but I think what they did most well is the interactive theaters and screens.  They are not too long (around 5 minutes) but each of them give you a taste of a particular battle or important event.  The museum are divided into stages within the Korean War - the early stage of Invasion by North Korea and US assisted counter-attack.  The second stage of Chinese Army invasion and finally the last stage that led to armistices.  Also numerous tanks, planes, and warship on the side of the museum and a children's museum (not sure why) attached to the War Memorial Museum for your kids' enjoyment.Overall a must visit and prepare to spend a good part of the day here."
53,4.0,My boys who are history buffs loved it. Closes at 6pm but outdoor area where the planes are parked are open all the time. There is a warship replica docked outside too which was pretty interesting.Now I finally know why the North and South were at war!Recommended! And free!!
54,5.0,"What an impressive place this is.  As an American, I feel so ignorant on the Korean war.  I learned a lot here, and it was very interesting to see.  You have to visit this place."
55,5.0,"Another place to give you a complete review about Korean Hystory.Don't forget to pick a war chronicles book at the entrance, it is fee.Lots of pavilions with several war itmes ... places ... cars ... And of course tons of Korean History details easy to go thru."
56,5.0,One of the best museums that I have visited and it is free! My kids loved it especially the 3d/4d rides. The videos screened are also very good and provide a good snapshot of the history during the period. Must visit attraction if you are in Seoul
57,5.0,this is good for History buff. its has a lot material to see and understand the history and ancient Korea.
58,4.0,"This place is truly beautiful. First off, it’s FREE. What a great place to go for no money at all. It’s educational, and coming from someone who HATES war museums and such, this was actually really interesting. The art was incredible in the memorials. Absolutely stunning. And the museum portion was so interesting and interactive. You get to go onto a real ship that was once shot up. It’s really interesting.Great for all ages, but be wary of the many stairs if you have any elderly with you."
59,5.0,"Real tanks and rockets display outside are the highlight for me. But the Museum itself is very informative, clean and organized - a lot of things to see like the turtle boat of Admiral Yi. Very child friendly. We spent 4-5 hours there. Highly recommended."
60,5.0,"An amazing memorial giving an insight into the Korean war, free admission and a fascinating display of the history of the war and subsequent events. Don't miss this one..."
61,4.0,"It was a great day out for kids have a look at all the planes, tanks even an old battle ship. The place also has a children museum which has hourly tours you can take surprisingly it was free. The place is interactive and teaches a lot about korean history."
62,4.0,"So much to see - you really need at least a good half day to get around the exhibits and displays. History about the conflicts in the region range from ancient wars to current situations including the Korean involvement with peacekeeping forces. Very emotional, as the tributes to those who gave their lives are really well set out, touching and genuine. The addition of more recent information about the hope for reunification adds a modern touch to this very well set out and organised establishment. Good english coverage with appropriate materials available for foreigners. A must."
63,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea had sculptures and artwork that were very moving and showed how the South Koreans feel about the war with the North and their hopes of reconciliation for a one Kore.  The area also had some nice cherry blossom trees.  Worth the visit.
64,4.0,Several statues and many airplanes available for viewing. Even a large war boat which one can board and walk on deck.
65,4.0,Very nice place it was a very nice place to visit in Seoul. Lots of history and information. Interesting airplanes and guns left from 1950 and many more. Must see
66,5.0,Very interesting museum located close to yongsan Went there on a Friday afternoon! Crowds were minimal. History covers a wide range of periods. Has a nice vehicle display outside as well as inside. 7 year old enjoyed it. Best part is the museum is free. So it’s nice if you want to go multiple times to take it all in.
67,5.0,"interesting, a lot of things to see and learn about Korea's recent history. Many things to see from Korean perspectives"
68,5.0,"This is a very educational museum. It is free of charge. You can also bring home a thick book about Korean War. The builiding is very nice, quite and peaceful. You learn a lot about the War. You may have hear about Korean War, but after the trip you will know all. If you like to read everything in detail, 1 day barely enough. For me, I will visit again because I still not able to go over the top floor....For the museum, there are no sign. When you exit the subway for museum, remember just go straight and follow the road. The museum is actually on your left hand side when you exit the station. However, you will not be able to see because of the surrounding building.  (I actually got lost)."
69,5.0,The visit was free and we  had the chance to learn a lot about the Korean history and the Korean war.Highly recommend it!
70,5.0,"Great place to visually see the history of South Korea and countries involved during the war, and is free. The museum is large you could spend a few hours, would be great for anyone interested in history and I feel the young children would also like, the visual displays."
71,5.0,"This is a place that if you love history will take you all day to read, listen and take in. Children of all ages will love the vehicles, planes and other items outside. Go early and beat the crowds... it is easy to find by subway or taxi."
72,5.0,At the time we were there they had a DaVinci temporary exhibit nearby. It was fascinating and we became very absorbed in the content. The statues are beautiful and capture the essence of the Korean war. Inside the museum is well organized and covers the entire history of wars in Korea. Many military artifacts. Great learning activity for teenagers.
73,4.0,"Worth visiting, should be combined with the outdoor exhibition of airplanes and combat vehicles next to the museum (which includes things from a B-52 via a copy of a sunken ROK patrol boat to tanks) which is quite interesting as well. For the very interested, the war museum itself is huge and contains a lot (some parts of it are very detailed and technical, for example the extensive exhibition on various ammunitions and technical sensors) but other parts are more interesting for the layman, if you come from any of the many countries that participated in the UN coalition during the war you can go and find the part of exhibition showing your country’s contribution."
74,5.0,"One of the best memorials, if not the best, I've visited. I loved the 4D viewings available, opening at the start of each hour. Limited seats are available so we had to wait but it was worth it. There is also a huge area where aircrafts, tanks, missiles, boats, and other military hardware are displayed outside the main building. I learned a lot about the Koreans and how they suffered in war, thanks to this memorial. Also very accessible to visit. We took the subway from Myeondong and a few minutes walk from the subway station. I plan to go back."
75,5.0,Visited with my 15 year old son who speaks English better than Korean. Richly equipped with historical artifacts and detailed descriptions.  Finely supplied with foreigh language explanations.
76,5.0,We visited the war memorial prior to visiting the DMZ/JCA and found it very interesting and informative. It was great to understand more about the Korean war before visiting the DMZ area. Definitely worth a visit
77,5.0,"It was a great learning experience and something entertaining to do, and it's free! It was very well thought out and put together, wonderful things to do and see."
78,5.0,"I felt proud of my country and the rest of the world who sent troops to help South Korea protect its people. The individual names of my countrymen who fought were written and remembered. It strengthened my faith in the goodness of mankind, his search for peace, love, friendship. Our soldiers contributed to what South Korea is now with their courage and bravery, and to many, their lives. After this tour, go to DMZ for a full circle."
79,4.0,"The museum looks interesting, but it depicts the USA as the best nation in the world and tends to overlook other atrocities. There is no entrance fee and the museum is a couple of steps away from Samgakji Station."
80,4.0,"I am a history buff. Since I was a kid, I really enjoyed reading things about military hardware and seeing them up close was very exciting for me. It was some sort of a Disneyland or Universal Studios for me when I went to The War Memorial of Korea. This was the first big war museum for me. I was not disappointed because they have a big collection of equipment used during the Korean War such as tanks, canons, planes and even a patrol boat at the grounds of the museum. That experience alone was satisfying enough for me and its free. Good thing my wife and daughter allowed me to have this moment. This sort of thing is more often appreciated by men and kids. After viewing and photo ops outside, we also went inside the museum. You have to get a ticket to view the entire museum inside. We decided not to buy a ticket because our time was limited. We just visited some of the collection which was free to view. We were also lucky at that time because there were some opera singers performing inside the museum and we were able to watch them for free.Going there, we took the subway (Samgakji Station). You can also take the taxi but it depends on where you will be coming from. If you want to get an appreciation of what South Korea went through and how it is preparing to defend its present and future, a visit to the Korea War Memorial is worth your while. Make sure your wife and kids agree with you first. If they do not want to go, go by yourself."
81,4.0,"Pretty decent museum with exhibits of all the wars Korea has EVER been in. Nice memorial for Americans who fought and died in the Korean War broken out by the state they were from. Nice outdoor exhibit of war planes, helicopters and boats."
82,4.0,"Spent 4 to 5 hours exploring the place.  Even then did not finish the indoor section.  Has a big collection (if not the biggest in the world) of actual decommissioned war vehicles from planes to tanks, ships and artillery firearms.No admission fees.  The lady at the gift shop has poor attitude.  The cafe serves great pumpkin latte."
83,4.0,Very nice place to visit. Enter the museum and you will learn a lot about the history of Korea and the wars.The Collection of war machines is impressive.
84,5.0,"Last October 2017 me and my sister visit The War Memorial of Korea located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. We went there via train from Myeongdong and alight at Samgakji station. The moment I saw the picture of the Statue of Brothers it mesmerized me - I am in Seoul and I need to visit it. Like many other attractions in Seoul the attraction is free. Since we stay in the bustling district of Myeongdong this is an escape from the noise and sound of the city. Though a lot of tourists are here it is very quiet and serene. The memorial is built to commemorate the victims of war and the soldiers who served to protect the nation. We entered from the left side and the Statue of Brothers will greet you which symbolizes the Korean war and below the brothers is a dome which is a mini-museum which has a crack that depicts the division between 2 Koreas and the hope for reunification. Following your track in the center is the magnificent Memorial Hall (museum) and in front are 2 separate huge statues of Korean soldiers which is totally grand and magnificent. And to your right are the vessels and artillery used in the war which includes a lifesize replica of Navy boat used in the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, guns, aircrafts, and tanks. You could get inside the Navy boat and see from yourself the captain's deck and what's inside and outside the boat. I really enjoyed my visit because I remembered how our forefathers fought for our freedom, unity and peace. It's worth a visit."
85,5.0,Here you can learn all about the korean wars and there are tours in english. Also there is a part of the museum for little children....
86,5.0,"You have to visit this museum if you travel to Korea. It tells you how to understand today's politics in Korean peninsula. You will find out how Koreans have been fighting internally and against foreign invasions in the past two thousand years, and why they separated into two countries in the recent seventy years. Most importantly it's all free. Is you are serious, schedule a full day tour here. Note most video shows are at the beginning of the hour, important if you want to see and hear about the history."
87,4.0,"We spent half a day here looking around and checking out the vehicles in the grounds, well worth a visit."
88,5.0,"Apart from Kpop, Kdrama and  smartphones, Sokor is known for one of the most brutal and deadly civil war in history, the Korean War in 1950-53.This museum gives special emphasis and showcases the gallantry of the south as well as their gratitude to the other nations who threw their support to their cause. This is best shown by the display of colors/flags of these nations. I was just disappointed though that their records dont bear the names of soldiers who were lucky enough to go hom alive as my grandfather did. They do pay special homage to those who laid down their lives helping a neighbor repeal their brother's invasion.On display on its sprawling grounds are military relics and weaponry through the years. A trip to this museum before or after going on a DMZ tour is highly recommended  for further context to understanding the Korean conflict."
89,5.0,"The museum was undergoing renovations and wasn't opened when I visited, but the display of the old artillery, tanks, guns, missiles and aircraft really was something not to be missed. From P51 Mustang, a Phantom fighter jet to an actual B52 Bomber on display, my son and I were simply in awe for the 2 hours we were there. Pity the museum wasn't opened. I'll be sure to come back again the next time I'm in Seoul.Oh, the pun in the title was really unintended..."
90,5.0,"It was good because throughout the museum, it gave lots of information in details how, where, when and why. The displays were good and fascinating, we were spending abt 3 hrs there and watched 2 short video in Eng, a 3D rides, looking at the guns, tanks, jets, and lots. The boys loved to feed the fishes ($1000won put in the box to get a bag of popcorns), and looking at the jets plus the museum is free entry."
91,5.0,"Large collection of old and current planes/tanks/artillery outside and 3 floors of exhibits inside. We just Ed did the Korean War level. Lots of videos as well as items, all in English as well as Korean. Clearly and well explained the background and details of the war"
92,4.0,"The place is huge! My family and I didn't get to explore all the floors because we arrived there at around 2 in the afternoon and every floor got interesting memorabilia and history that it might really take a while before you move on to see another section. At the ground floor, by the way, is the imposing turtle ship (not the original one) made famous by Admiral Yi Sun-shin. If you haven't yet seen the movie, ""Roaring Currents"", watch it and you'll see how the turtle ship made an appearance there. =)At around 5:00, we decided to skip the other remaining top floors and head out to check the war ship docked outside the museum and the fleet of war planes and tanks. It was so cool, really.There's so much to see in this place and so much awe-worthy historical war items. My country was a part of it too (during the Korean War, them and the Koreans were allies) so it's really heartwarming to see that our soldiers are not forgotten. ^_^"
93,3.0,"We visited this place because we were with my brother-in-law and he may be interested in this museum. During our visit, there was a field trip of little kids, and they were all adorable. There are fighter planes and jets outside the museum, which would catch your interest. Inside the museum, there are different areas that would touch your interests."
94,5.0,"The biggest war museum and memorial hall in Seoul.Great for visitors who are interested in the history, especially on wars and military exhibitions.- Accessible from metro Samgakji or Noksapyeong station. Or buses.- Free entrance.- 2~3 hours to watch slowly.- Outdoor museum has aircrafts, artilleries, vessels, tanks, missiles, choppers, etc. The replica of patrol vessel, PKM-357 engaged in 2002 is allowed to enter. Some landing vehicles, too.- In memorial hall, visitors can take a tour to 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor. There are many items of Korean military history as well as Korean War.- Materials of United Nations engaged in Korean War.- Multimedia rooms.- There is a large square outside the memorial hall and it's nice to relax."
95,5.0,This is a great museum. The whole complex is so clean and the people are friendly. Interesting that there's no charge. There's much to do so plan a whole day. It was interesting to see that the country's in this region have been at war on and off for thousands of years. Like the Middle East and Europe. Kind of sad the no one ever figures out the was isn't accomplishing anything.
96,4.0,"It was a very interesting memorial. It was filled with exhibits that touched on many different aspects of the war. It also had videos and 3 dimensional replicas and real souvenirs from the war, so it was constantly entertaining."
97,5.0,I was hesitant to come due to an aversion to anything that pertains to wars but my husband really wanted to see it.  I came away with some dread regarding our future as it appears that not much has changed especially with all the posturing by North Korea happening while we were there.  But it also gave me hope that the human race will again come together to oppose their aggression as they have before.
98,5.0,"Nice and calm museum to understand war history in Korea.  It's free admission.  I've been many times with my kid.  There is nice cafeteria for coffee & cookies in  building.  If you are lucky, you can see traditional wedding for real couple in the garden side.  They have combat plane and tank for view.  It's good to walk around regardless of weather."
99,5.0,"It is a very good museum to understand the history of Koryo division. Although it from one side opinion, but it gives you a clear and bigger picture of the event. Well maintained museum, and it's free, audio tour also available, and for the children there is a playground at the back of the war arsenal yard. Been here several times, and I strongly recommend for visitors to come to the museum. And so they know that KOrea is not only about Halyu and K Pop."
100,5.0,"The Korean War memorial was an outstanding experience.Took both my kids here during our stay in Seoul and it's a huge place. So many things to see & interact with here.Lots of history regarding Korea as a Nation and its culture. So many beautiful sculptures and historical artifacts and models dating back thousands of years.You could spend the whole day here and try to absorb it all but with 2 kids in tow, it wasn't meant to be.They have daily tours here so best to research and book yourself a tour as we just ended up going on our own. I think the tour would offer more insight into the museum.You can select the preferred languages in different sections/parts of the museum (where applicable) so that no one misses out on all the informaiton rather than staring at stuff not knowing what the h*ll it is).A great place to learn & educate yourself of Korea and its history."
101,5.0,We absolutely loved the place! We engaged an English speaking guide who we met at the lobby at 10am - he was very courteous and came across as quite knowledgeable. Its a very interesting place to visit esp.to soak in Korea's historical background. Children will find the displays outside very exciting.
102,5.0,I visited the museum with a group of American Korean War Veterans and found the experience very moving. The museum describes the war in a chronological order and displays some of the weapons used. The Bed Check Charlie brought back memories for some of the Veterans in our group.
103,5.0,"Wonderful and large with lots to see in the museum, which is free. The memorial also has a huge display of tanks and planes, etc from the war. A must see."
104,5.0,This memorial provided a vast background and history of South Korea.  An enjoyable tourist attraction one should visit.
105,4.0,"We enjoyed a quick visit one night while in Seoul.  It was interesting but not a must see.  The plans, tanks and other military equipment display was fun."
106,5.0,"We stay in Itaewon.Just take the 421 bus line towards Seoul station.On the way there, the bus stop at this place.My nephew love it here.Outside area very big filled with planes, tanks, ship, boats and helicopters that some you can go inside it.A lot of time spent outside.Didn't have time to go inside the building.Will definitely go again."
107,5.0,"I was very surprised to find that this was my favorite part of South Korea. The museum is very well done, with videos to explain all the bits and pieces. I learned so much. We couldn't finish everything and came back a second day and enjoyed it just as much the first day! The only downside is that there was no restaurant except a mini-mart that had cup-o-noodles. I would plan meals away from the museum and break it up. Free entry and ships/planes/vessels from the war that you can explore outside!"
108,4.0,"Arrived late in the afternoon so did not get to go inside however, the exhibits outside we excellent and kept us engaged for well over an hour. Many planes, tanks, and even a ship can be viewed."
109,4.0,"The outside area provides plenty of replicas and statues related to the Korean War and the armed forces in general, that a visit just to the outdoor area is worth it. The large plaza with plaques commemorating the countries which joined in the Korean War is a very informative and sobering exhibit."
110,5.0,Spent 3 hours inside an out trying to see everything.  It is a very good way to learn of the conflicts that Korea has good throug for over a thousand years. Starting with external kingdoms the Japanese and Chinese and finally the 20 th century to now.  Very well done
111,5.0,"After a visit to the DMZ, the logical place to satisfy one's kindled interest and get an in-depth knowledge about the Korean war  is in the War Memorial of Korea. Inside this imposing structure is a museum that puts you right into the Korean War. It is so configured that one is led into halls displaying how it started, who were involved, how it progressed, how it ended.  A great tribute to all nations (whose flags fly proudly outside the entrance) that sent  combatants and non-combatants alike to help a nation under siege. Spent about 2-2.5 hrs here. About a 3-minute walk from the subway exit. Admission is free."
112,5.0,This memorial was great to visit and well executed.   Everyone in our group from 80 to 11 came away impressed and enjoyed it.   We spent nearly 3 hours and could have spent more time.
113,5.0,A fantastic tribute to all nations involved in the Korean War. Great look at Korean history. Indoor and outdoor. Great location! 100 meters from line 4.
114,5.0,Excellent and well designed museum!  Although it includes the most of history of Korea and wars they fought the largest exhibit is about Korean War.
115,5.0,"This War Memorial of Korea was the best museum I have been in Korea and possibly elsewhere. Not only does it describe the war, it is very big. Usually with this size of museum it probably would describe the entire history of Korea. But this museum describes the history only of the Korean War which is very interesting. ALSO FREE. WOW."
116,5.0,"I haven't seen many foreigners visiting the museum but I went there with my parents after checking out reviews here, and I wasn't disappointed. It's such a meaningful and interesting experience. My grandparents are holocaust survivors and therefore every war themed museum feels very close to heart. It's also good for people who want to learn more about Korea and not just travelled there because of the hallyu wave. Totally recommend!!"
117,4.0,"We should have budgeted 2 hours here, as we didn't have enough time to see all we wanted to. Informative and impressive collection."
118,5.0,"My husband, teenage daughter and I visited the War Memorial of Korea on our recent trip to Seoul. This is quite a massive museum, which covers the Korean War in great depth and also various other Korean conflicts through the ages. As foreigners, we found the Korean War exhibits of greatest interest. Extensive galleries are dedicated to this conflict, with hundreds of artifacts on display all with detailed English explanations. Each of the countries that participated in the war also has its own mini-exhibit with statistics on troops served, casualties, etc. In addition to more traditional object displays, the museum also incorporates some interactive, digital elements and shorts films, which bring the history further to life, particularly for teens and young people who tend to be more screen-oriented. There is also a large outside display of military aircraft, vehicles, etc., which is quite impressive. Personally, I would have liked to hear a little more about the civilian experience of the Korean War but the military history and geo-political aspects of the conflict are extremely well covered. Note that the museum is really extensive. We spent approximately 3 hours on our visit but military buffs could undoubtedly spend an entire day, as there are so many things to see and discover. The free admission also make this a very accessible visit. Highly recommended."
119,5.0,"This is really a historical place to visit, the flags of all the countries contributed or rendered support were there standing. You will see many kinds of air force planes and we're lucky that during our visit there's an exhibition which was fantastic."
120,5.0,Have to give credit to Seoul that this museum is free. It had English translation for probably most if not all displays. it had 3d and 4d short movies for free.  Best museum in Seoul according to me.
121,5.0,i tooke a bus to get here from Myeongdong station exit 8 infront of Migliore. get off exactly when the sign the war memorial. worth to be here as we can see the tanks ships and fighter jets used in the korean war. close to the ministry of national defence. any bus to itaewon will stop here. the subway-need to update the name- close to the ministry.but 5 minutes walk
122,5.0,I've been to many museums having grown up overseas and in the Washington DC area. This was one of the most impressive. I'd go back on my next trip. It's that good.
123,4.0,"This is our second visit to this excellent site. Like the Australian War Memorial, this is not a celebration of war, but rather a reminder of the costs of war spanning the history of Korea. The displays are interactive and interesting and well sign posted in English. We spent an easy 3 hours here and our 5 year old was captivated. The outside display of Korean War equipment was a highlight and incredibly informative. Highly recommended! There's a small children's museum at the end of the display and you need to reserve a time at the counter. Unfortunately no activities are in English, but you can easily interpret what it is. At the end there is a play area which was quite welcome on the rainy day we visited the museum."
124,4.0,"This is my 7 year old boy's favorite museum in Korea. He loves to climb up the stairs and look inside the exhibits like planes,  tanks and others.  You can easily spend an hour outside just playing on the big stuff and snapping some photos.  Inside has more serious exhibits and info on the UN forces and losses during the war.  Also admission is free.  Worth visiting at least once."
125,4.0,It is a must see place in South Korea. Full Korean war history is displayed in the museum. Need almost a day if you want to cover every thing in detailed.
126,5.0,"Excellent attraction with first class exhibits inside and out and full description in multiple languages. We visited this venue with our grandson who is studying the Korean War at school.Highly recommended attraction, a definite 'Must See'."
127,5.0,"We didn't have enough time to go to the entire War museum and will go back in the future by planning more time to see it all. We only went into the Korean War area. Very helpful in understanding the war and the peace and reunification that South Korea desires. Great displays inside and outside. Outside displays include a ship that you can go on. Also includes, planes, tanks, etc. Large memorial was very moving."
128,5.0,"I`ve visited this place several times, each time it`s a great feeling, there are many showrooms and different items regarding the korean war. I`ve seen also represented all countries witch took part to the conflict. Outside there are all the weapons of the korean war (tanks, aircrafts, choppers etc.)I suggest yout!"
129,4.0,"I loved the outdoor exhibits and the various exhibits indoors too. However, more labelling or explanation would have been helpful in some of the indoor exhibits"
130,5.0,"This is an excellent museum, covering South Korea's military engagements since 1945.  They have an extensive collection of tanks and aeroplanes and well set out displays on the Korean War, Vietnam War and South Korea's involvement in UN operations.  My husband and teenage boys all loved this museum.  We spent most of the day here."
131,4.0,"If you are planning on going to the border (DMZ, JSA etc) you should come here first. Also if you just want to brush up on your Korean history knowledge😀The entire museum is great, but especially the sections on the Korean War offer an easy, inspiring and educational overview of the war. There is no entrance fee!"
132,5.0,"This is my first visit to a war museum and i am glad we included it in our itinerary. We went there at 4 pm and i was a little sad we missed the scheduled 2pm tour (the other time being 10am). But we were very happy that they arranged a special tour for us!! We appreciated the place more because of the tour guide. If you want to visit the place, pls attend the tour. It will be more meaningful that way."
133,5.0,"That the memories of the Korean War have not yet faded is clear by this monument and museum of almost North Korean dimensions. There is a large exhibition with numerous film clips about the recent war, but also about the wars ion the hundreds of years of previous history. Also the present state of the army is exhibited. The monuments show the gratitude of the South Korean people for the many countries of the UN that came to their aid without often even having an idea of whom they were helping. There was just this notion of injustice being inflicted on innocent people. Actually an example for the present day."
134,5.0,The museum is great especially the outside exhibition with all the ships aircraft tank and other military vehicles The inside is also well organised and with your smartphone you can enjoy explanations There are very interesting rooms. If you like history you definitely have to go there
135,4.0,I think it is more than just a War Memorial bec the various rooms do give a decent history of historical Korea
136,5.0,"This memorial has special meaning to US tourists I think, US lost lots of soldiers helping out here.  Very well done, explained history well"
137,5.0,"We went expecting to see some basic memorials, and was blown away by the breadth of this museum.    The best no-admission-cost museum we have ever been in, and one of the best overall.    Great for anyone looking to learn more about Korea."
138,5.0,Well layed out. Interesting. Lots of  audio visual exhibits. Outdoor section great for kids to see real planes and tanks.
139,5.0,"Enjoyed our visit here. If you have limited time, skip the lower level exhibits on earlier Korean military conflicts, they are a little dry. The experience in the Korean war section was much better."
140,5.0,"Totally cool place to take your sons on a history tour of tanks, aircrafts, war ships! They have the famous Korean turtle ships! More of a father & son place to visit, while the ladies go off to get our hair done or go shopping. This place is free, so why not!"
141,5.0,"If you want to learn about the South Korea history and wars, this War Museum and Memorial is superb and impressive. The artifacts are detailed and comprehensive. The infrastructure and design of the museum are fantastic. My son and I spent the whole day awed by the exacting details of the museum. The clever use of the multi-media provided a very humanistic experience to the museum. I was most impressed to know that the whole of third floor was dedicated to the UN and allied forces who fought in Korea Wars. I would strongly recommend this war museum - a Must Visit place if you want to know about South Korea History."
142,4.0,"This is a nice indoor and outdoor museum.  I enjoyed the aircraft static displays.  If you want to see the Children's museum, they had a reservation system on the Saturday we went to control the number of children admitted at a time.  We only had to wait 20 minutes for the next window of time to open.  It took less than an hour to complete the children's portion.  We only went through two indoor exhibits and it is a very well done memorial.  Highly recommend visiting while in Seoul."
143,5.0,"An amazing museum with too much to see in one day, but not to worry if you are military because addition is free for you and dependents, so split it up for different weekends."
144,5.0,A must visit. My grandpa was in the Korean War so it I really wanted to get pictures to send home to him. I'll never regret this and I have a deeper appreciation for Korean War vets.
145,5.0,"My wife, 12 year old son and I really enjoyed this museum. It covers a lot more than the Korean War and the building is quite impressive."
146,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea pays tribute to all the soldiers of all the nations that united in conflicts across the globe.Very hands on where you can look in the window of a real B52 Bomber, walk the decks of an ill fated Navy Frigate or feel and touch the artillery and weapons of past conflicts.Easy for kids and well catered for families. Food, drink and rest facilities.Time in right and you can see some amazing performances, depending on the holiday."
147,5.0,"The museum was one of the highlights of our trip. It was a bonus that there were no entrance fees. Be prepared to spend at least a few hours here as it is massive! The majority of the museum is indoors but there is also an outstanding outdoor section where you can explore the various military aircrafts/ships/tanks (and can go inside most of them too!) The majority of displays, including the videos, have English translations. There is so much history within the building and really worth visiting. The videos are also a must to watch! One tip: I wouldn't recommend the 4D video experience if you get nauseous easily as is quite full-on with lots of flashing lights and spinning experiences on the screen."
148,5.0,We really enjoyed visiting this museum.  They have many wonderful displays and it was very easy to walk through to see everything.
149,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting his war memorial.  My son was only 5 and we walked around the venue quite well.  It was a very well set out memorial.  The displays of planes, ships and tanks were incredible and I had not seen it anywhere else in the world."
150,5.0,"Three floors of history, taking in the whole military history of Korea. Start on the ground floor left side and then follow the arrows. Great artifacts and the videos are worth watching ( you can select language). Korea was a country beset with wars of aggression against her culminating in the utter destruction of the Korean War, which makes her current (rightful) place at the top table all the more worthy of respect and admiration."
151,4.0,"The War Memorial of Korea is located not too far from the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul -- which is known as an international area as it is close to various embassies and US Army Garrison Yongsan. The memorial is very interesting, and you can spend as much or little time as you like here, taking it all in. Recommended for any balanced tour of Seoul and South Korea."
152,5.0,I went in solo and I learned a lot. I would suggest everyone who visits Korea to come and check the place out. It talks about wars with Japan and the most recent war. Great place to visit with friends and to take pictures. This place is well worth the time spent walking around.
153,5.0,"Believe me, I've been to a LOT of war memorials, and I've had my share of days in museums. But going here was different. I should have planned to go there for two whole days, instead of just half a day. I learnt much about Korea's troublous history, and appreciated how things go in our present time.. For war and history people like me, don't forget to miss this place when you come to South Korea!"
154,3.0,"From Samgakji Station, we passed the Clock Tower of Peace and The Statue of Brothers at the West Gate. These are poignant reminders for visitors that peace must not be taken for granted. The memorial did a good job to present historical accounts in a chronological order without overwhelming details. The outdoor exhibition area is interesting but I was disappointed to see the replica of the PKM-class Chamsuri Warship. I expected the actual vessel.One major improvement badly needed is to put English translation of the Korean text. I understand the challenge as there are strong demand for Chinese and Japanese as well. Another aspect to consider is to tone down the rhetoric - maybe gradually with time. Some European museums have also exhibited atrocities committed by their own soldiers during colonial period.German museums and memorials displayed balanced presentations in explaining events leading to the world wars and reunification of Germany. This Memorial has a lot of potential and can start by toning down the rhetorics.Nevertheless, it is a good place to spend 2-3 hours to gain an understanding of the unfortunate geographical position of the Koreans."
155,5.0,"After 20 year overseas marriage with a Korean finally visited probably the most important site in Korea. The amount, quality and coverage of information superb! Wish we'd visited 20 years ago..."
156,5.0,"Visited the museum, quite impressed with the information and details provided on wars in Korea. I learned more and understood the Korean War now.  Many good exhibits and video presentations too"
157,5.0,A well documented war history. Highly recommended. Please allot at least 2 hours to explore the place.
158,5.0,"This place is actually quite big, we spend approximately 2 hrs there. It's a very good place to learn more about the olden Korea, how Korea has became so successful thought wars. Very big and nice in the inside, lots of mannequin and historical stuff."
159,5.0,"The Korean War Memorial is part memorial and part museum of the conflicts in Korea up to and including the sinking of the Cheonan and the current homegrown defence industry exhibits.  There are a variety of videos and interactive exhibits to see while you are there.  The exhibits of former military vehicles, armour, artillery and aircraft outside of the main building are well maintained and well signed.  All in all well worth the visit."
160,5.0,"Ample english placards, very friendly staff.  The planes, tanks, and weapons systems on display are impressive and fun for all ages to get up close to.  The war history covered inside is incredibly well displayed in multiple mediums.  This is a good experience for non-military, military, and children mature enough for seeing realities of war."
161,5.0,"I have been to the War memorial or what should be called the Korean War Museum multiple times. It has great exhibits, especially the planes and tanks out front. Most of the signage is in English and Korean so self guided is no issue. It is close to metro and bus stops, so also easy to get there. Highly informative with excellent exhibits."
162,5.0,"This museum is very well done with great interactive displays that rival the World War I museum in Kansas City that is also a top class facility. They do not just focus on the Korean War, but cover everything from the earliest conquests of the mongols until activity with the currently on ongoing operations.We brought kids ages 6 and 9 and they were interested throughout. They really enjoyed looking into the aircraft and military vehicles outside the museum as well. There were a few 4D movies that the kids enjoyed as well. Best part about it is that it is free.  No charge anywhere, which makes the overall display even more impressive. If you have limited time in Seoul, I would recommend this location be on your list."
163,5.0,We decided to visit the Korean War Memorial after taking a day trip to the DMZ.It was a good lesson particularly on the Korean War.The outdoor exhibition of military equipment was also very interesting.We spent about 2 hours in the museum - and could have easily spent another hour there if we were not rushing off to another place.
164,5.0,"A must visit museum in SeoulSamgakji station line 6 exit 12( exit from the train and walk straight, you will see a sign showing direction to Museum Wedding hall and just walk straight. You will see the The Statue of Brothers(Monument).Outdoor and Indoor museum. A 3 story museum(if i don't recall wrongly) need about 3-4hours(to slowly read and watch the short clips). There is theater on short movie about 20 mins. Outdoor exhibition is the airplanes, tanks used in past wars including the Chamsuri ship PKM-35. Amazing place to see and read on the experience and memories of the past wars.A place to remind us that FREEDOM is not FREE"
165,5.0,"This huge complex consist of indoor memorial, outdoor military gallery and kids zone. This is a must visit place if you come to Seoul. I'm using a Seoul sightseeing bus facility to reach there."
166,5.0,"If you know the KR War, the memorial does not fail to impress. We went unaware it was a closed day. We still had access to the grounds. What is impressive are the military relics you'll encounter without being on a military base. The UN flags out front inform of participating nations, their input, & sacrifices. The metallic monuments are stunning & larger than life."
167,3.0,"a bit of a one-sided museum, naturally but would have been good if the North Korean perspective can be elaborated and explained."
168,4.0,"South Korea really does seem to do museums and memorials right.  The War Memorial is in a gigantic, expansive building.  It also seemed like some areas of the building were not yet completed or there was still room for more exhibits.  The outside grounds were also immaculately taken care of, with numerous statues (esp. the Korean War Monument, Statue of Brothers), a humongous area (circle) in front of the museum with the flags of the nations that participated with South Korea in the Korean War, and more.The inside is quite moving in places, especially the Memorial Hall which is quite unique and haunting.  There are numerous exhibits and rooms.  I would suggest around at least 2-3 hours for a fairly decent circuit of the place.  There is a cafe in the place, although I didn't try it.  The admission was also free when I went."
169,5.0,My teenage boys couldn't get enough of this museum and memorial. Allow enough time in your schedule - they could have stayed all day. Actual tanks and fighter jets in the outdoor part of the museum that you can access. Indoors the exhibits were state-of-the-art and you can actually experience live combat. We all left with a better perspective and understanding of why the US fought in the Korean War.
170,5.0,"I could have stayed here all day.  There is so much to see and read.  We started outside with the planes - we had a 3 year old in tow.  She loved going up into the tanks and on the ship.  There was a little children's play area and children's museum too, but we didn't make it into the children's museum.  The museum was incredible.  So much information.  We didn't get to stay long looking at all the exhibits because of the above mentioned 3 year old.  And, this museum was free!  Amazing!  Highly recommend taking the time to visit here."
171,5.0,"We visited towards the end of the day, but still worth it. The park in the middle of the city reminds its citizens of the devastation of war. The monuments are poignant memory for the sacrifices of the soldiers from allied countries as well. Every Koreans must visit this park!"
172,5.0,If I hadn't been in a group I would've stayed here for so long. I really liked seeing the model of the turtle ship. It's wonderful.
173,4.0,Different periods of Korean history - take time to visit :) we spent about 4 hours both outdoor and indoor.There are many well-known retired warplanes showcase in the outdoor - great for the younger ones and even we adults took interest in it too.
174,5.0,place to memorise the soldiers who die in war against japan and north koreaplease be quiet thereyou should go there if you like to fell sorry people.
175,5.0,"I'm someone who's always been interested in History especially that of a country. I didn't have much anticipation when I decided to go to the war memorial but the moment I was there, it was like a small kid being brought to a huge exciting playground. Tanks, airplanes and boats displayed outside with meaningful statues were those that appeared in sight when I arrived. I was already hyped up even before I entered. Looking through at the exhibits, I regretted for not spending more time there although I was there for more than 2hrs. I didn't go to all the exhibitions since I had other places to go but I will come back again. Even if it's for the same exhibitions. That is how awesome the place was."
176,5.0,"Very spectacular war memorial in Yongsan for a war that is considered the ""forgotten war"" in the US but certainly not in South Korea..."
177,5.0,"We visited this free museum and probably spent as much time outside as inside.  The outside displays (planes, tanks, guns, boats, etc) are very well preserved and there was actually ongoing maintenance of one of the planes while we were there.The inside has sections for various themes such as the Korean war, captured enemy weapons and artifacts, Korea's role in foreign wars like Vietnam, desert storm, etc, and other themes.  The displays were very well done and thorough.  For example, providing a cutaway sample of an antitank missile.  Most of the signs included at least a rudimentary English description.  We spent about 3 or 4 hours there and did not see half as much as we'd like to have.  We will have to go back some time."
178,5.0,My father in law was killed in Vietnam in 1969 and it is traditional for Koreans to honor deceased relatives. My wife is from Korea and after visiting the grave went to see the grave sites of past Presidents to include the first President of Korea Syngmun Rhee.
179,5.0,This is a very moving and beautiful memorial. It's free to see ( along with quite a bit on the property) but if you take a minute to really look at the art behind this and see the true meaning of the piece you will be moved. It is exceptional.
180,4.0,"It's nice that most of the museums in Seoul are free which is the same asthe museums in Washington, DC. The war museum is free to enter and a very nicely organized museum. It's easy to follow the time line and I learned a lot about the war from my visit. It is great for kids because they have a children's museum and an outdoor playground for the kids."
181,5.0,There you can learn about the Korean War (Forgotten War in American term) in detail if you particularly are interested and see various weapons actually actually used during the war together rwith all papers/maps etc. exhibited inside & outside of the museum.
182,5.0,The entire museum is pretty great.  Our kids loved the outdoor stuff and children's museum.  There are weird height requirements for the children's area- but we took our baby and let him play around even though he wasn't tall enough.  They didn't seem to mind.  Our other kids enjoyed it a lot.  They only let you in for 50 minute periods that start watching hour- and when it's busy you may have to wait to get in- but we went on a weekend morning and it was empty!
183,5.0,We took up the offer of a free guide (look around at the entrance as was not clearly visible). This made our experience very insightful.
184,5.0,This location is a must-visit for anyone interested in war history.  The museum is well funded and laid out - going over the many centuries of battles that shaped the historical landscape of the Korean peninsula.
185,5.0,"I have been to the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan before, and compared to that, I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is really huge. It is conveniently located next to either Namyeong Station or Noksapyeong Station. The museum can be a good addition as a next stop afterwards if you have a prior Koridoor DMZ or JSA tour, since the Koridoor office is very close to Namyeong Station itself.The indoor section of the museum itself consists of 3 floors of various exhibits, from the ancient period such as the Three Kingdoms of Korea to the modern day. Of course, the highlights in the exhibits are heavily focused on the Korean War, which is often known as the Forgotten War due to the more well known Vietnam War overshadowing it. There are plenty to see within the exhibits, such as firearms, uniforms and scale models of military vehicles. Sometimes, there are also special exhibits that are shown for a limited time. In our case, the museum held a special exhibition regarding firearms used by actors or actresses in Korean films. It was very fascinating to see rather unique firearms close-up first hand.There is also the outdoor section of the museum, which display various military vehicles, artillery and aircraft, and even a replica 1:1 scale of a South Korean patrol boat. The amount of vehicles here is simply astonishing and well preserved. You can see both Western and Soviet tanks and aircraft, such as the M4 Sherman and T-34, or even the massive B-52 Stratofortress jet bomber! You can even go into the back of the APCs, such as the M113, for some memorable photos. There is definitely plenty of stuff for everyone to take photos with.I would recommend at least 2 hours just to cover the inside of the museum itself, and it is very ideal for a rainy day activity. However, do take note it is closed on Mondays though. For those with an interest in military history or those who want to know more about the Cold War legacy that still continue to plague the Korean Peninsula, this is a must go. Best of all, it is free!"
186,5.0,"I visited this place with my 2 boys.  We loved it lots of information about Korea War. Also very interesting for kids as they can see the planes, ship and other weapons. The admission is free."
187,5.0,"Really well put together museum with something for everyone, just be mindful there is a fair bit of bias and there is always two sides to every story.  Enjoyed the inside and the outside bits - and the kids learnt heaps"
188,5.0,This place is excellent a must visit for history lovers you will learn a lot about history and very beautiful and well funded international Musem. This is one of the best museums I ever visited in my life. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I am United Arab Emirates citizen o traveled numerous places this is truly a must visit experienced. I'm shocked that the entrance is free. The quality and information offered is of exceptional quality. You can spend more than 5 hours and not finish. It's that wow.
189,5.0,"I would compare this to our Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C. The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. I could not believe such a wonderful place offered free admission. Well worth your time to visit."
190,4.0,"Be aware it is closed on mondays! However it was really intersting to take photos next to a warship, and some air crafts including Really HUGE ones, and see some skud rockets, and weapons from both sides of the war ( both US and USSR made).I liked the concept of remembering all countries contrbutions to the war. The green areas around the outdoor area were great too."
191,4.0,"We do have a very good time in this museum, especially in outdoor exhibibition.Lot of war machines, such as : tanks, ships, airplane, rocket launcher, etc. My kids like it so much. They try every one of them, and take lot of photos.They also have indoor exhibition, and war memorial museum for childreen also. Indoor exhibition explains more about ancient story of Korean war.They also carve the of soldiers who died in the Korean war.And all of those thing is free. Yes, you read it right. You don't have to pay anything when visit this museum.You can reach this museum by stopping at Samgakji station, exit 1.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
192,5.0,Nicely done memorial and museum. Special recognition and acknowledgement is given to each country that participated in or supported the efforts of the Korean War. Highly recommended.
193,5.0,Excellent Memorial and Museum. It helps to understand the Korean War deeply. Fantastic materiel in exhibition both outside and indoors
194,5.0,I went here with my kids and they enjoyed walking aroung and learning more about the history of the war.. they liked most the outside displayed war machines
195,5.0,"Two years ago was my last visit but nothing has changed.  This is a must do attraction to get a snap shot of the Korean history.  There are displays of each transition of military battles to the current state of Korea.  If you are a history buff, maybe a whole day is best to set aside. Great place to let the children run out all their energy. There are the typical souvenir shops and food too.Of course, this is just for snacking. There are many outstanding traditional Korean restaurants around the War Museum.  And by Metro, three stops away from the infamous foreigner shopping area Itaewon."
196,5.0,Nice Museum in Korea. The history of korean war between north and south korea. Must place to visit in seoul and free entry
197,4.0,This place is free admission. A very big place where you can walk around and get information about the country. Also a great place to cool down and for the kids much more exciting then the palace.
198,4.0,Great museum with lots to see. My favorite part was the outside aircraft expo. The inside is a nice rainy day activity. They often have pop up activities for kids as well (with a fee). Worth a visit if you have an extended stay in Seoul or if you're in the Itaewon area. Definitely go if you have kids!
199,5.0,"I am a history guy, and military history is my drug of choice.  it is amazing how this place has changed of the years and it keeps getting better."
200,5.0,You can see korean history in war perspective. History is all about war and this place is all about the wars in korea fron ancient to modern.Easily accessible by metro and bus.Free admission...Good place to take photos with old war plane and tanks if you are interested. My children were really happy.
201,5.0,"This is such a wonderful place to visit for a history buff or anyone that just likes to learn. Both the outdoor and indoor exhibits were excellent. You not only get to learn about the war from the Korean perspective, but you also get to learn about all the other UN forces that fought in Korea. This is a museum that I will visit more than once."
202,5.0,"The war memorial is amazing.  I thought I knew a lot about the Korean war, but quickly realized that I didn't.  Anyone could easily kill 3-4 hours in here, if you spend the time through the exhibits.  I would say it's quite difficult if you go through here with young children, but don't let that turn you away, as I took my 2 and 4 year old through here in 1-2 hours.  Definitely recommend!!"
203,5.0,I would recommend to go for this in a day trip as you will have a much more understanding of the history and culture of the modern Korea. This museum is carefully design and try to give as much information as possible.
204,5.0,"If you want to learn about Korean history, this is one the most important things to do in Seoul.  If you want to party and hang with friends, then still make time to see this place."
205,5.0,"This war memorial is a must-see when in Seoul. Allow plenty of time as it is very large. If you're interested in war planes, there are numerous ones there to see."
206,4.0,"As a middle aged American, married to a Korean for almost 30 years, but NOT military, I can appreciate both sides. The American military that sacrificed  to save South Korea during the Korean War and the struggles of the Koreans during that period in South Korean history.It is sad that the younger generations, from both countries, either don't know or don't care about all the sacrifices during the Korean War, and they need to see this Memorial, so they can appreciate where South Korea was and is today, because of all those would suffered and sacrificed"
207,5.0,"Such a beautifully kept museum. So much has been gathered here and is spread over 3 floors.  One could spend a full day in this museum and still not be done checking it out.  Outside the main building you may find a children's museum, a field showing off military crafts and tanks as well as a ship. Seriously worth seeing!  If you understand or speak Korean, you may also enjoy the interactive films shown every once in a while at various places within the museum."
208,4.0,This Museum/Memorial was a good mix of outdoor (lots of actual planes including a B52) and exhibits indoors that tells of the Korean war.  I wasn't sure about going but am glad we did.
209,5.0,"Of all the places I went to in Seoul this is definitely a top 5. Be ready to spend several hours as you go in and out the exhibits and the different history war moments of South Korea. Museum has an app for free guided tours but be aware that as of Aug 2016 there is no free wifi on site. So you should download museum app before heading there. Very strange as there are free wifi hotspot almost everywhere in the city. There are also human guided tours free of charge at least 2 times in the day. Admission is free. Loved the outside exhibits is war planes, tanks, helicopters and ships."
210,5.0,"I went to the war memorial with my small family.We spent like 4 hours at the memorial.We were fascinated with all the weapons, missiles, planes, tanks, war ship (not sure whether full scale or otherwise) etc as we do not have this kind of memorial in our place.Very interesting place to visit and admission was free and open to public."
211,5.0,great place minimum 4 hours to see everything I got an opportunityto speak to a professor of history about the war which is better than reading a book.
212,4.0,Large variety of military memorabiliaInformational for kids Great rainy day activity Close to the base Friendly Staff
213,5.0,"We went there one of the afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by the extensive display of old tanls/artillery/warplanes from the WWII, through Korean war to relatively more current times."
214,5.0,Had time to kill so we decided to stop here.  I would suggest everyone stop here. It was very nice. Very surprised
215,5.0,Visited the Memorial with my teenage daughter.  We both really enjoyed it. The Memorial gives good insight and understanding of Korea's ancient and modern history in a way which is easy to take on board. The Memorial is free to visit and you can easily spend at least half a day here. We've been here for a week now and we've visited a lot of places but this has been one of my favourites so far.
216,5.0,"This is probably one of the best museums I've ever visited, especially considering there is no entrance fee. Just walking around outside you could spend 1-2 hours looking at all the exhibits: planes, tanks, armament, boats, and memorials. The inside is gorgeous and has multiple floors showcasing not only the Korean War but also early Korean history. There are 2 small restaurants and a gift shop inside as well. Easy access to Yongsan Army Garrison."
217,5.0,"It should be visited when you are in Seoul. It's a sacred place not only for Koreans, but for many other nations."
218,4.0,What impressed me about this grand facility is not only the massive size but also its modern presentation in a picturesque setting. Indoor displays were interesting as well as the outdoor exhibition of armament & sculptures. An impressive destination worth a visit!
219,5.0,"We didn't know what to expect from this place, but it was a really well done museum/memorial that kept our teenage boys interest as well as ours.  We went on a DMZ tour in the morning (also highly recommended if you have an interest) and the bus dropped us off (at our request) right in front of the memorial when we got back to Seoul.  (Not sure if all DMZ tours offer this).If you have a relative or friend who perished in this conflict there is a kiosk to look them up.  The statues were grand and moving and the interior exhibits were really well done and gave a very clear overview of the conflict.  We learned so many things that we didn't know.  Highly recommended to get an understanding of this war that continues to shape life on the Korean peninsula."
220,5.0,"We just arrived in korea a couple of a days ago and are staying at the dragon hill. This museum is easily accessible through gate 1 or by gate 16 (but a bit further of a walk from 16). We found this museum to be excellent. Lots of areas have ramps so it is easy to have a stroller here. There is also a food court outside the museum and a small cafe with sandwiches inside. The exhibits are everywhere, outside there are tanks, planes, sculptures and memorials. Inside are displays that are relics of the Korean people that document their history. Very educational. We were able to see the description title of most objects in english, a couple of videos as well have buttons that can be clicked for English too."
221,4.0,"This museum can be done quickly in two hours or all day long.  Depends on how much you would like to learn.  It is indeed about all of Korea's wars going back through history, not just it's most recent.  Everything is titled well in English and I had random Korean veterans pop up and explain things to me about the Korean war.  The Memorial room was beautiful and poignant.  Also really loved the grounds and statuary.  As a side note it currently has an Impressionist exhibit which you are charged for if you want something different."
222,5.0,"We were greated at the door by an English speaking member of the memorial staff. He was so helpful, explaining what to do first and walking us there. He suggested seeing a short film on the third floor and then working our way around. Great advice! Plan to spend several hours there to fully experience everything. If you are looking for lunch, most of the food is actually outside of the building, to the left of the front entrance."
223,5.0,"Not only does the War Memorial of Korea allow for much learning about Korean history, but it is a great museum for keeping attention. There are activities for children outside as well as all the old planes and tanks to climb on. There are also numerous exhibits that everyone in our group, children and adults, enjoyed like the Turtle Ship and Vietnam war dioramas. Because it's free, it is possible to split into a couple visits if you are visiting many museums to void getting museum weary here, because all of the museum is really worth time to see."
224,4.0,Big museum with extensive historical information on the Korean War.  I was surprised that Koreans also like to hold their weddings here.
225,4.0,It's a wonderful place to learn about Korean War. Be ready to spent at least half a day. Cafeteria has great food. It's a great way to spent a rainy day n best it's FREE
226,5.0,"You want to visit this place to better understand the conflict between North and South Korea. There's an AVP in one room where you can watch some old footages. They also have a hallway that displayed names of fallen soldiers from different countries etched in granite stones. It's terrible to see though how many people suffered, but it's a good education. When we were there, the place was packed with students."
227,5.0,Visit this instead of paying huge money for the DMZ tour. You'll learn a lot more about the history and the culture of the korean people plus access is FREE! We hightly recommend it!
228,5.0,Very impressed with the quality of the displays and presentations. You can use your cell phone to scan a code at different displays to get translations. Many sections have 4 language options. There is plenty to read and see in English without the cell phone scans.Great use of technology and visual displays. The sculptures and military equipment surrounding the museum are moving and interesting as well.Only had time to go through the Korean War sections but there are many more sections to see. Museum is closed on Mondays but the grounds are always accessible.
229,5.0,It was touching to see the tribute of the Korean Government to the Filipino soldiers who died during the war.
230,5.0,"My wife, son and I were excoriated by our Korean exchange student and his mom. The Korean's are very thankful for the Americans help. I was moved at the respect for America by the Koreans. I hope everyone has a chance to experience this and never forget the sacrifice made. May God continue to bless America and South Korea!!"
231,5.0,"This is a beautiful, big, well played out museum. It's certainly worth a trip. There's a fantastic collection of vehicles and planes outside, and a ship to go on. Inside, it's interactive, and informative. We wished we'd timed the 3D shows, but we missed them each time and didn't feel like going back for them. As the Korean War is technically not over, the Korean War section helps you understand  past and present of Korea."
232,5.0,"Lots of history here, going back to ancient times and up to the present. Lots of airplanes, as well as ships and tanks.  Gives thorough history of Korean War."
233,5.0,"-Interesting and thrilling museum that contains everything you wanted to know and more about the history of war, cold war and it's effects.Is totally suitable for kids, but expect a lot of question that will be though to answer (like why many people had to die??!!)-Kids will have so much fun with the planes, tanks, and all the war gear that is available to jump on and take a picture.-Plan for aprox 3 hrs to spend here.-Place is suitable for strollers-Entrance is free"
234,4.0,"Both my dad and young son loved this place especially the outdoor area where we could go up close to planes, helicopters, tanks, etc. Good photo opportunities and best of all, all free! Exhibits indoors were informative and the 4D experience rather memorable. I was able to really feel the realities of war and the current need to preserve peace going through them. Stroller was available for rent (free) and premises stroller friendly. My dad also managed to collect a free book on the history of Korea and the war, making him a very happy man."
235,5.0,If you want to learn about the Korean War then this is the place to go they have all of the planes and tanks ever used in the war on display it's huge I would recommend spending three to six hours it's intense it's very well done and you learn a lot it's very informativeIt's also good for any age little kids who love it too old people so anybody will love coming here
236,4.0,"The museums is very good and you can spend a few hours here. We took a volunteer student tour, which was very very poor. We actually had to read everything ourselves. The museum otherwise is impressive"
237,5.0,"I've been there several times with my family. Good interesting and peaceful place :). Have different kinds of military transport like ship, airplanes and tanks displayed outside in the park near museum. Your kids gonna love it 'cuz they can touch and try everything. They hold the traditional wedding ceremony sometimes it was interesting to look at for us one day. And the museum inside is good as well. Not the best one I think but worth to visit. In the same building you can find different expositions not related to war."
238,5.0,Loved this museum as there was so much to see and learn. Kids (ages 11 and 9) came away with alot of new knowledge. Took 4 hours to go through it all. Highly recommend for age - awesome place.
239,5.0,"If you are interested in military stuff you can easily allocate 1 whole day for this site.So much to see and so much to read!Be sure not to miss the 4D movie theaters on level 3  (1 show per hour)Best of all, its free!  :)"
240,4.0,"A visit to The War Memorial of Korea helps give insight to the Korean Culture of today.  After all, the War happened in a not so distant past.  There are guided tours in English at 2:00pm and some time in the morning, as well."
241,5.0,"We went to the Korean War memorial, it is very nice.  The site has many static display's of aircraft and tanks from the Korean War.  The monuments are inspiring and very thoughtful.  It is a short walk from Iaetwon."
242,5.0,"I have traveled throughout Korea and this is my favorite place. It's magnificent and solemn. The lessons I learned about the struggles of the Korean people for freedom and the Alliances and sacrifices that earned their freedom opened my perspective not only about the Korean War, but the world. I fell in love with the Korean People. I highly recommend this visit as one of your first experiences in Korea. Especially if you are unfamiliar with the Korean War or you think you are. It is impossible to see the entire museum in one day, so we picked a section indoors and out and plan on returning with family and friends. Noksapyeong station exit 2 or samgachi exit 1/2. It's a quick cab ride from itaewon or Yongsan stations."
243,5.0,"Spent a couple hours here and never even made it inside. Great exhibits with statues, aircraft, vehicles, tanks, missiles...even a Korean Navy ship! Can't wait to go back to fully explore this place. #1 stop in Seoul for a reason folks."
244,5.0,"This is a top military museum and memorial in one.  Kind of like if the National World War 2 museum in New Orleans was next to the National WW2 Memorial in Washington, DC.Great exhibits and an outdoor park with planes,, tanks, etc in a truly great collection.  The building itself is amassive, impressive structure on par with one of the Smithsonian buildings."
245,5.0,"It's a great museum for all ages. You can ask at the desk for a bilingual guide. The museum covers Korean history from 1000 AD to the Korean War and has lots of planes and tanks for kids to touch and go inside! A sunny day is best, but still lots inside to see as well."
246,5.0,This memorial is huge compared to anything in the USA for war memorials.  Has great information and visuals/videos about the Korean War starting with end of WWII through the war in the '50's
247,5.0,"A very good and informative place. Have to visit it with kids, can climb some airplanes to see what's inside. For adults will be interesting too. A lot of different countries' equipment.Free to visit."
248,5.0,The name of the museum can be confusing since this place hols much more than just information on the Korean War. Spend the day here travelling through the world of Korean history
249,5.0,"We visited as a family of 3 with a 2 year old in a stroller.I was very impressed with the size and quality of this museum. There were three floors of detailed exhibits, detailing Korea's involvement in international conflicts. Highlights:Outside they have many life-size airplane, tank, and ship models.There is an outdoor play facility for children, as well as a children's museum of sorts.The whole facility is easily accessible for those using a pushchair/stroller, including lifts and ramps.Exhibits:They are mostly in both English and Korean. Most of the signage around the facility is as well. Most are very detailed and well thought out. Very informative without going overboard.The exhibits are mostly not opinionated - they just state facts: dates, locations of conflicts, number of trips involved, etc.I would definitely recommend visiting. We were here almost a whole day and didn't see everything. We had a really nice time though!"
250,5.0,"The Korean War memorial is definitely worth a visit when in Seoul, and preferably before the visit to the DMZ.There are many multi-media displays, including a 4D theater (with limited seating) which puts the audience in a first person point of view to experience Operation Chromite, the audacious amphibious landing attempted by General Douglas McArthur, which turned the tide of the Korean War.It also clearly spell out the cause of war and the evils the far eastern communist bloc which shattered dreams of Korean unity.A 5-star attraction that helps one appreciate the fragility of the freedom we enjoy, and the price paid by those who gave the ultimate sacrifice."
251,5.0,My family enjoyed going here. It is huge and all free! Lots of military memorabilia to see. Loved seeing the B52 up close!
252,4.0,Worth the visit. It's free and very well maintained museum. The outdoor exhibitions of tanks and planes actually made our stay enjoyable.
253,4.0,"For an outsider, it's a bit of an eye opener. The history of Korea is quite shocking, and for such a small nation, they have had to endure perpetual persecution and wars. If you are a history buff, it's a must see."
254,4.0,"I've seen several memorials commemorating only a particular person/persons or just the country on which it was built.  The War Memorial of (South) Korea though, gives praise and gratitude to the nations that assisted in that bloody war.Flags of more than 10 nations including the Philippines are erected lining up the center.  So tourists from other nations can have a taste of pride taking pictures of themselves beside their flagpoles.The memorial also exhibits more than a dozen of war machine artillery (planes, jets, ships, tanks, and my personal favorite, an apache helicopter), which is the most I have seen.And the best thing is, the place, monuments and exhbits are well maintained and kept clean."
255,3.0,The Korean perspective on the war is in line with the typical Korean perspective on things. They were getting beat down; which they do admit a little. They do recognize the help they received from nations throughout the world but they minimize the American involvement that turned the war around. The minimal recognition of the American effort and loss is disrespectful and insulting. But that's Korean.
256,3.0,"Since I went with a tour guide, I can’t really speak for everyone because it all depends on the service. And since I can’t speak for anyone, I’ll be talking about how my trip went.	So when we first arrive, it was crowded, full of people, and full of liter. But I thought it was just little things, and that I can worry less about it. 	While just looking through away, the buildings are really interesting and massive, I have gone through the history of Korea and the origins of time.	There’s only a little bit of English translation so if you’re a foreigner you might get bored easily."
257,5.0,A great place to learn about the harshness and the reality of war. Free entry for the exhibition and lots of activity on the outside.
258,5.0,"The War Memorial of Korea had a lot for our family to see. It gave a great background to the war in Korea along with videos, testimonials, and lots of information. We rushed through it, but could have easily spent 4 hours there."
259,5.0,"worth a visit... join the free guided tour. shows how much south koreans appreciate the global help during the korean war. good on ya south korea for being so advanced after being destroyed during the war!!! tears in my eyes and goosebumps for me, seeing many of the exhibit...some moving stories."
260,4.0,"This is a nice opportunity to look at some of the military vehicles, aircraft and other equipment and events that Korea has experienced through war.  This is well worth the visit.  I recommend this and think it is a great place to start your view of Seoul."
261,5.0,"Very big memorial , with touching lists of the many men and women who perished in the Korean War. It also is a museum with a floor dedicated to Korean Military History and other floors for the Korean War. There is also a modern era which highlights the Korean Militaries current equipment, complete with static and dynamic (including films, 3D, 4D films!) displays and a huge outdoor yard filled with planes including a B52 , a whole patrol boat! and lots of military vehicles like tanks, APCs, Canons etc."
262,5.0,"Overwhelming in size and intensity, this Memorial is a stark reminder of Korea's still painful recent history and the unsettling fact that nothing is settled.  The Museum is free and takes a couple of hours to absorb it all."
263,5.0,Very sad to see the names of the dead from all the different countries that helped during the war. Very well laid out and concentrated on Korean war and older wars in basement.
264,5.0,"We visited this museum because my father-in-law was interested in S.Korean history and we had 4 kids in tow ages 7-14. I thought they would be so bored but instead I was pleasantly surprised that they liked it. This is due in most part to the excellent exhibits that made the Korean war very interesting. An English-speaking guide gave us a 1hr tour. Although his English was a bit difficult to understand at times, we gathered enough information. They had many  videos (one in 3d) and art installations that the kids thoroughly enjoyed so make sure you watch those. Then go out to the Peace Plaza and marvel at all the different planes and tanks, very well maintained I might add. Oh and did I mention that entrance is free?"
265,5.0,"This was my first time here and I have to say I was quite impressed.  From this visit you get a full understanding of the history of Korea, the dynasties, all the occupations from other countries, and what was happening in the rest of the world during these events.  There's a children's museum that is good for young kids.  The outdoor part with the planes, tanks, and ship is also a bonus.  The entrance is free and they were giving out books on the history of Korea!  Access to the museum is about a 5-10 minute walk from the subway station."
266,3.0,"If you are a history buff, this is a great place to visit!  The museum is free to the public and there's a lot of history to go through.  The structure is beautiful and very serene especially if you go right when they open at 9am."
267,4.0,"I visited war memorial with my family in the month of June. Make sure you visit the place when its not raining and the weather is sunny or atleast favourable. It's free of cost which was pretty amazing. History of korea is very well preserved. Loved the giant military statues of men outside the museum. They have a lot to cover outside as well as inside. For an outdoor view, you can have a look at various models like a giant military ship, military tanks and planes. And get yourself clicked. Indoor, they have a museum which showcase the korean war history. It was quite an interesting and a knowledgeable tour and we got to learn a lot about the korean history and war. They also have a canteen outside to sit and grab your meals. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. It took us about 4 hours to cover the entire place. All in all, a pretty amazing outing and definitely worth a visit."
268,5.0,"Our family trip to Seoul meant that we needed to pay our respects to all who served in the War. My father was in the 75th Mountain Div. and my wife's father was in the Navy, participated in the Inchon landing and received the Inchon Landing Commendation Medal. For us, and for our children, this was something we needed to see. What impressed us was the honor and respect shown by the Korean people  for the sacrifice of those who participated in the War. There were several statements about how the United Nations forces responded and fought for people they did know, and a country they never heard of. Every MIA was listed, by State, on bronze tablets which paid respect to our soldiers, sailors and marines. I came away with the feeling that Koreans are truly grateful for the sacrifices our Country made. The Government spared no expense, and exhibits were very well done. Skip the 3D video of the Inchon landing as it is waste of time. It takes you through an animated bombardment. Instead, spend your time in seeing the history of the struggle. It was very well done."
269,5.0,"Beautiful and sacred war memorial dedicated to the struggles of North and South Korea. One cannot help but be moved by the sculptures and their descriptions. There is no fee to tour the grounds and the museum closes at 5PM. You will have an opportunity to walk amongst tanks and airplanes. In addition, you can view a replica of a boat that came under fire by the North Koreans as recent as 2002. Hot chocolate and coffee beverages are available for purchase through vending machines throughout the park."
270,5.0,"The name may be slightly putting you in the wrong direction. It's a very big museum with a lot of information about Korea and it's wars from prehistoric ages untill the Korean War in the 1950's. It's impressive and very good if the whether is bad. It's also the only place I know to buy pins with the Korean flag and the different allied troops flags (like the Netherlands, Australia, Turkey, Luxemburg etc)."
271,5.0,"Place of pride for the locals and a lesson in history for visiting tourists. No entrance fees, great exhibits. Some planes and cars to keep the interests of the young visitors."
272,5.0,"Worth a visit to get a historical perspective of Korean war history. Lots of hands-on display (both indoor and outdoor) and entertaining videos,including some 3D movies. Huge place and need at least 3 hours to explore all the exhibits. Very well presented. Highly recommend it."
273,5.0,This place makes you to think about wars and offer many things that you did not know about Korean war
274,5.0,Great place to learn about the Korean War. Every person should visit and learn all they can so that they can have a true appreciation of the sacrifices that have been made.
275,4.0,A lot of history and has special exhibits. This is a must visit for anyone that wants to understand the significance of the Korean War.
276,4.0,I love the short video of Heroes and love one. Total captured the essence of the struggles during war time.
277,5.0,"Such an interesting place to visit. My son learned a lot from the museum. We were even lucky to get a copy of the book ""Korean War 1129"" by Lee, Joong Keun. It has a day by day account of the Korean War. It is a place both young and oldies will enjoy. I was with my 7yr old son and my 66yr old mom and I think all of us appreciated the time now living without war. My mom would recount how her parents would tell her stories about the war and she said she is very grateful we would not experience it now.The museum has all these interesting war planes, missiles, and guns used during the Korean War. It also is very heart touching to see the list of all the names of soldiers from different countries who died during the war. Very educational trip."
278,5.0,"This is a very good war museum that displays the war history of Korea, especially the Korean War. There are displays outside the museum as well as a large collection within the museum. Allow at least two hours if you want to see all the displays. We found the 4D theatre really good. Overall it is an excellent place to visit."
279,5.0,I visit war memorial in Seoul nice place to see and have lots of knowledge of Korean War. There is many people and have a great time you never feel how time goes.
280,5.0,"Didn't have any expectations when my brother planned for us to go to the War Memorial. But I'm so glad I went ahead with it because it's one of the places you can't miss if you're ever visiting Seoul.The museum displays history from as far as during the medieval times.But the highlight would be the Korea War. The place feels very surreal with the artifacts, lightings and music playing in the background. And also they have multiple video rooms to show old footage taken during the war (a few language for you to choose) to bring you to a better level of understanding of the blood and tears their forefathers contributed to have the South Korea they have today.It's a pretty educational place.The whole museum is very big, if you are really interested, do go earlier. It closes at 6pm but we only reached at 2pm and ended up didn't have enough time to complete viewing everything."
281,5.0,"The Koreans take their history very seriously and are truly patriotic.  The War Memorial is fantastic, very surreal as your walking around observing machines used in the Korean War while orchestral music plays in the background, quite an wierd feeling. With so much to see expect to spend a large amount of time viewing the memorial part and Museum. Very interesting and informative.  You really must see it."
282,4.0,"We didn’t originally plan to come here; the name sounded like it would be a war monument. But it’s also a museum, and someone recommended it. Now we’re so glad to have experienced it, especially the section on the Korean War.We’ve heard of the Korean War but never really knew the details. The museum presents the history of events in a clear and educational way that was also engaging and provoking. It was never boring. Instead, it opened our eyes to what happened in those intense few years. It was heartbreaking and amazing, and also sheds new light on current affairs today. Really humbling.Very nicely done, would recommend it. Plus admission is free."
283,4.0,This is a very eyes opening museum. Very clear explanation & the environment is clear & friendly. A lot of new/ high tech (4D theater) are available in this museum.
284,5.0,"This place is a good place and entrance is free. If you love history and wars, this place is for you. (closed on Mondays)There are lots of monuments outside the building and you can take tons of pictures and even your kids will love all the planes/boats/vehicles exhibits. Its recommended both for  kids and war/history fanatics. There is no entrance fee but some exhibit INSIDE the main building have separate fee. Make sure that the weather is not too cold or raining to really enjoy the outside exhibits. To go there: there are 2 stations where you can align to be there: Samgakji Station of line 6 or Namyeong Station of line 1. Use the Namyeong Station since it is a lot closer to the main entrance than the Samgakji station (we walk for 15 mins from that station before seeing the BACK of the museum) If you suddenly went hungry or need to take a pee, there is a cafe inside the main building and a comfort room. Also, there is a building on the side for food selections."
285,5.0,"We stayed in Seoul for two days, and used a private tour guide (Jake from This is Korea - fantastic guide). He took us to the War Memorial, which was very worthwhile. The memorial has a wonderful exhibit outside of many tanks, fighter jets, and other military equipment and planes. Very interesting. Inside the museum the focus is on the Korean War, and how the US and Russia were involved. This was a great museum and anyone visiting Seoul should spend a few hours at the War Museum."
286,5.0,"We really enjoyed the war memorial. It is so well done & interactive.  The planes, tanks, vehicles were interesting for the kids. The memorial is just huge & our children did get tired after awhile, even though the adults could have stayed longer. There is also a children's museum there for young children, which they enjoyed. I would love to visit again, as it was very moving."
287,4.0,"This is the best museum of the Korean War I have encountered. Very strong. Frankly, however, it is pretty over the top in favor of Macarthur. My personal feeling is that this could have been a major war due to MacArthur's recklessness. Containment worked here. At least through 2015. . ."
288,4.0,"Visited the War Memorial with my family. We spent about 4 hours there and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Lots of exhibits and videos about the War with the North Koreans and the Japanese. Although we went on a weekend, we were surprised that the place wasn't packed with people. The outdoor exhibition area, in which tanks, planes, missiles and even a mock-up of a gunboat was displayed ....was very good.Sadly, directional signs on the route one should take in the exhibition halls should improve. We were slightly disappointed that two big halls were closed."
289,5.0,"This was the end destination of our demilitarized zone tour. The DMZ joint security area was closed when we were there due to tensions between the two nations.  Since my dad was in the war and I am a history buff, this museum and memorial was very touching.  There is much to be learned from a visit here."
290,5.0,"This place is huge.  Very impressive.  For someone interested in this kind of stuff, one could spend the entire day here and not get bored.  One section (there are 8, I think) features military transport of all kinds and missliles.  There is a whole B52 bomber on display, various tanks, a whole ship, APC's, missile and mortar systems, artillery pieces, etc.  The museum is closed on Mondays.  There is an admission charge if you want to go inside. Very accessible.  From the subway, get off at the Namyeong station.  Signage is aplenty so it is pretty hard to get lost."
291,5.0,"Must see for military historians or anyone that wants to understand the American ""forgotten war"" from the perspective of the Korean people that couldn't avoid this conflict that has torn their society in half.  The military equipment displays are fascinating and fun for young children to climb around on, and the memorial to the fallen is sobering."
292,5.0,Title says it all. External displays are well worth a walk around and one of only two B-52s on show in the world
293,5.0,"It has indoor and outdoor exhibitions, of which the latter is more worth visiting. Award-winning statues, and real military planes, tanks and missiles are exhibited outdoor. Exit 12 of Samgakji is closest to the museum."
294,4.0,"As the name suggests, this is about the history of war(s) in Korea.  For kids, looking at display of tanks and navy boat and armory guns could be of interest.  Worth visiting for fans of history."
