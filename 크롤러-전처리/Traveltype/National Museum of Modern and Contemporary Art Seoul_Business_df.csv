1,4.0,"Recently opened in fall 2013, this museum restored Jongchinbu and established as a cultural center that embraces the past and present of the site. The ""LEE BUL"" exhibition during the time was amazing."
2,5.0,I did not intend to go here but after visiting the palace I walked past this and thought to go and have a look . I thoroughly enjoyed it as it gives a great insight into a more modern south Korea. I only had limited time and could easily have spent longer there. Try it.
3,4.0,Big spaces with big installations. Very interesting the engaged work of Amar Kanwar (dec 2013). Worth spending a couple of hours.
