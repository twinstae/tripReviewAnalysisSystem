0,5.0,"Another one of my favorite places to re-visit in the Gangnam area is Seolleung and Jeongneung Royal Tombs. I come here a few times a year for a peaceful walk. This is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site and it houses the Royal tombs of King Seongjong, Queen Jeonghyeon and King Jungjong. Due to Corona Virus, the complex wasn’t too busy, but there were a few people out walking wearing their masks. The adult ticket only costs 1000 won (a dollar) and it is open until 9pm. I came on a Sunday so it was a bit busier than normal. It is not too far from Seolleung Metro Station and about a 10-15 minute walk from Coex. There are many cafes and restaurants all around. The area is paved, but there are small hills and or stair planks to walk to the tombs. But if you can skip some of them and just stay on the main ground which is wheelchair accessible. Modern, clean toilets on site as well."
1,5.0,"I enjoyed walking around this place so much! Very beautiful park with great landscape and Korean pines. Plus, of course, a place of history and spiritual significance. Wonderful atmosphere of tranquility and peace."
2,5.0,"This was a nice way to spend a couple hours. Very cheap to get in (1,000 won). They provide you with an English brochure. Tombs aren’t terribly exciting but the park itself is beautiful and it is hard to believe it is in the middle of the city. If you are nearby, you should stop and visit."
3,5.0,"It was autumn when we went to the Royal tombs, there were 8 tombs in form of hills.  A peaceful place to visit."
4,5.0,"The tombs were a five minute walk from my hotel. I went around 0800 on a weekday and there were a lot of elderly Koreans getting in their morning excercise. The tombs were very interesting with stone guards at the top of the mound. You can only walk to the top of two of these and view from the side at the top but that is adequate . The entrance fee is $1000korean won, which is very cheap. I took the time to walk around the park and it was lovely. There was a very very old ginkgo tree, lots of cranberry and persimmon trees which were in fruit when I went. Beautiful Japanese maple were red with autumnal leaves. There were heaps of birds and I got to see a wild pheasant . A peaceful beautiful place to visit when in seoul"
5,3.0,"The location is easy to get to if you take public transportation, metro or a vehicle. The park is not very busy and does not seem to have peak hours. The entire place can be toured in about 30 minutes to a hour.Admission for adults is 1,000 Won."
6,4.0,"These are the easiest to reach tombs in Seoul (there are several tombs through Seoul). The grounds are very attractive and the cost is only 1,000 Won to visit."
7,4.0,"I didn’t think it was possible to have such a large place to myself.  I visited at around 1830 on a Sunday afternoon.  It’s surprising to have such a vast forested area in the center of such a large metropolis.  It was a great place to go on a walk and imagine a time before skyscrapers.Seolleung station orange line exit 9.  Cost is 1,000W."
8,5.0,"I was just there yesterday as it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel L7 Gangnam. I went for a nature walk and absolutely loved it. It's easy to walk and there are plenty of benches around for those who want to take a break. It was so green and pretty..almost felt as if walking in a forest. I went to 2 out of the 3 tombs, and liked the Korean traditional hanok houses but was really impressed more with the nature. I could believe such a peaceful place exists in Gangnam. It was so refreshing to take a walk and ponder. Would love to come back in the fall."
9,4.0,"Great visit for about USD $1 or W1,000 takes about an hour, light walking great for  meditating not very busy I went on  Sunday light tourist and local public. Grate to buy a drink or coffe before coming into the park, food is not allowed. Very peaceful and near the Bongeunsa Temple about 15 minute walk. Definetly worth the trip if you're near the area. If your hungry they have many good and beverage options right in front the main entrance."
10,4.0,"Located about a 15 minute walk from the COEX convention center, this UNESCO site is easily toured on your own, and a nice oasis in the middle of the city. Only 1000 won ($1 US approx) to enter, you're provided a map with walking paths - most are dirt and there are hills so wear good walking shoes. There's a clean restroom inside near the entrance gate. Each royal burial mound has a fence around it so you can't get really close but the statues and mounds are visible enough. I spent about 30 minutes here but could have spent more (it was frigid and windy the day I visited!)."
11,3.0,"The park has 2 kings and one queen burial grounds. It is a nice place to walk in Seoul also best visited when the cherry blossom usually begins to bloom. the seen is very romantic. The walk effort is moderate, suitable for all ages."
12,5.0,"This was the first place I visited in Seoul, it was AMAZING! The entrance is very cheap and it's a huge land where you can walk around for hours between trees and beautiful buildings. Downer is that you cannot approach the tombs, where the statues are, but it's very peaceful and you can see enough from the barriers."
13,4.0,"This cultural landmark is a green, peaceful place for an historic stroll in the busy Gangnam area.  Allow an hour to walk and see the monuments and burial mounds.  The grounds are well maintained and the staff is helpful.  The entry fee is modest.  Be sure to approach from the correct side with the entrance gate -- it is a long walk around otherwise, and the location of the gate is not obvious on some maps.  I visited early Saturday morning, and there were only a few other visitors.  It's not a great photo op, but a nice thing to do if you are on a business trip and have a couple of free hours."
14,2.0,"Out of respect the tombs are fenced off/ closed off from the public, but if you feel like going for a bit of a walk in the park for 1000won and you have time to spare go for it. Otherwise the brochure itself will give you better photos than you can take in real life. If you have other items on your itinerary this definitely should not take priority."
15,4.0,"DATE VISITED: November 15, 2014PROS: Went here for a check, but somehow enjoyed my walk. The people running this place were very friendly & helpful. Some locals went here for a walk and jog. Cool place for a visit.CONS: This should've been free for public. Just like Bongeunsa Temple which is free to the public.LOCATION: 5/5PRICE: 4/5HOSPITALITY: 5/5ATTRACTIONS: 3/5"
16,5.0,"The Seonjeongneung tombs were easy to find from the metro station. A small entrance fee gets you into the site where the tombs are, tall buildings surround the park and it is so peacefull, a great escape from the busy city. You can't get too close to the tombs but you can see the statues that are on top of it."
17,5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I made the journey via subway from Euljiro 1ga to this World Heritage listed site but was incredibly glad I made the trip. There are three royal tombs here and each one allows you to appreciate a different aspect of these massive structures. The sheer size of the earthen burial mounds and the impressive statues atop each tomb are awesome to see up close. There is no English information in the History Hall within the grounds but the English language brochure gives plenty of information about what you are seeing. If you have enjoyed learning about the Joseon dynasty in Seoul's museums and palaces, the tombs will be an enjoyable addition to your itinerary. It is quite easy to find one you get to Seolleung station and is a fascinating place to spend an hour wandering around."
18,4.0,"Collectively, the Royal Tombs are listed as UNESCO sites. This is located in the heart of Seoul and provides a good example of single style tombs. At about $1- worth the experience."
19,3.0,"Think of this as a nature preserve in the middle of the city rather than a tourist attraction.  If you are looking for a peaceful stroll along well maintained and wooded paths with lots of different types of birds, then this is your park.  However if you are looking to see the burial tombs and learn some Korea history, this is not your best option."
20,4.0,"Heard about this park near my hotel in yeoksam. Thought it might be a nice place to go for a run. Not that kind of ""park"". I don't run through burial grounds. But an intriguing place to walk. Enjoyed the spirit stairs and spirit walkway that were off limits to visitors. Seems there were many birds on the property and the congregated near the burial grounds. Overall a fine experience. It is open until 8 pm. Think it might be interesting after dark but have yet to visit after sunset."
21,4.0,"A green area located in the middle of chaotic business district of Gangnam, containing the tombs of the 9th and 11th kings and one of the queens of the Joseon Dynasty. It serves as a peaceful and quick getaway location for the people working or living in the surrounding area which is full of plazas. Inside the green area, all the tombs have exactly the same setting and seeing any one of them is almost identical to seeing all. A spiked gate, then a T-shaped shrine and in an adjacent hill, the grave inside a mound and the statues of civil and military officials standing in front of the mound. It is worth a visit since admission fee is low and the park is beautiful and peaceful."
22,5.0,"Went out on a Geocache journey and found 3 near this area!! If it wasn't for that , I would not have found this great historic place! As of September 2014, the fee was 1,000won and well worth it! make sure you have enough time to visit all three tombs and to learn about them! Ensure you have the right clothes to wear because you will be walking on dirt. I came here at 6AM right when they opened and found that lots of people jog and walk around here for exercise!"
23,4.0,"There are a few things I liked about this attraction. It was only 1000 won and it was walking distance to the Intercontinental Coex where I was staying. What I liked best though was at the center of the site all you could see were trees, plants and birds. Unfortunately the tombs are on the edges of the site so some of the serenity is lost when you hear the cars and see the tall buildings (see pictures). Regardless it's interesting and nice to know that the history has been preserved.You can get a decent view of two of the tombs and a handful of buildings but for the third tomb there isn't a good vantage point. They have brochures in English which was nice because very few of the signs are in English. I'm not sure how large the entire site is but it was definitely a good way to stretch your legs in the city while learning about the Korean Joseon Dynasty that lasted over 500 years."
24,4.0,"Jeongnung is the royal tomb of King Jungjong which is in the same grounds as Seollung (the royal tomb of King Seongjong and Queen Jeonghyeon) and thus visited together. Collectively they are called ""Seonjeongneung"". These three well-preserved royal tombs in the Gangnam district were included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 2009 and makes for a very good visit in the Coex Mall area. Admission costs KRW1000 (~USD1) and gains access to all tombs. The attraction is closed on Mondays, and opening times are early (6 or 630am) til 8pm. A few minutes from the entrance, there is a building which houses an introduction center for the site. Most of the text is in Korean, but there are excellent animation videos which show how the tombs were constructed in the 15th and 16th century. Unfortunately there is no English information for foreigners to know more about the Kings and Queen who were buried here, but there is an English brochure which makes up for this lack. There is also a postcard available here which gives a view of Seollung from the back, closer to the tomb (note the tombs can only viewed from the side). The royal tombs are on very high mounds; with Jeongnung, the stone sculptures can only be partially seen from ground level. With Seollung one can walk up to the level of the tombs but as mentioned they are viewed from the side. At the foot of the Kings' burial mounds are sacrificial buildings with simple interiors and there are two stone paths leading from the red gate. Avoid stepping on the spirit path and spirit steps as these are considered sacred.  What was lovely about this attraction is the wooded area between Jeongnung and Seollung which offered a very pleasant stroll through lush greenery. These tombs might be similar to other royal tombs which are found in other locations in Korea (also inscribed in the World Heritage list), and may feel repetitive to some. However for first timers, Seonjeongnung makes for a very good, interesting and easy attraction to visit. Other attractions enjoyed in the same area are Bongeusa Temple and the Pulmuone Kimchi Museum. Seonjeongneung is walking distance from Coex Mall or you can take Line 2 Seollung Station, Exit 8. There are wheelchairs free for use as well as baby strollers for rental."
