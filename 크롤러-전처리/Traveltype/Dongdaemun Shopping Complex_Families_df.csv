Allocate at least 3 to 4 hours here if you are into handicrafts. There's a food court at level 6 serving authentic Korean food at good price and great taste. Dun miss it if you are around that area."
1,3.0,"This is one place where there are several floors of shops selling fabrics and related accessories. Unless you have in mind cloth or buttons, zippers, etc, you may want to give this place a miss or just pop in for a feel and quickly move on."
2,4.0,One of the numerous shopping areas in Seoul.  It was fun to explore Korean shops as well as the expected type of clothing stores.  You could spend a long time exploring.
3,5.0,"this place is huge. if you love open markets go here. we did not spend time inside, we walked all around outside. there is some good food and great people watching."
4,4.0,"this is a big area consisted of buildings and shops.  i came here without doing much research beforehand so i didn't know where was the best place to shop for what i need.  however, i can tell this whole area will have everything you would need in the fashion business if you know where to look.  There are indoor areas with products in all price ranges, so shop smart.  bargain is possible but i didn't bother."
5,4.0,"I interested in night shopping there the place are full of tourist, the prices are not very cheap but you can find some bargains on clothes and accessories. Doota is luxury shopping center but there are multi stories shopping centers are cheaper. If you are shopaholic don't miss it al least once to experience the trendy Korean fashion."
6,3.0,"First time go to South Korea - Seoul, i search first about Dongdaemun market and i expected it will be street market but the reality is not street market and just open until 09:00 PM (South Korea - Seoul Time). Maybe Should go there from morning or around 10:00 AM (South Korea - Seoul Time)."
7,3.0,It a place filled shop selling materials for making clothes. It seems like it has all kinds of accessories too beside the cloth. You can find various types of bedding too
8,5.0,"For you all who like to shop, this is one of the best place to do shopping. You can shop till midnight. You can also find store to buy souvenir and other korean things as gifts to bring home. You can also find so many many restaurants and street food in this area with reasonable price. Most of the things in Dongdaemun Shopping Complex is clothes and accessories."
9,1.0,"Too much of a labyrinth and a crowded one at that. Came to buy luggage. Took a long time to find any.. hours actually. Instead found a house of buttons, a house of ahjumma clothes and a house with about 5 floors of fabric.. If you know the area or are visiting with a korean friend it might be a better experience but for us it was pure agony.. Only good part was finding a modern underground shopping area nearby by accident."
10,1.0,"DDM is really overhype. We should have read TripAdvisor reviews first before spending our night at this place.There are a lot of shopping complex around DDM, but most of them sell similar things and is more expensive than Myeongdong, I wonder how they got their reputation of ""budget/ wholesale"" outlet... I also have no idea how these shops can open until midnight or 5am because most of the malls has no crowd at all and is very very quiet! I bought a bag at Myeongdong for 10000won, and a similar one is selling at 25000won at DDM.Since the malls are a huge disappointment, we proceed to look for the famous yellow tents to source for better deals and make the trip worth it. However, yellow tents sells mostly counterfeit goods and a small men's bag can cost 60000won!Save your time and visit other places instead!"
11,1.0,"Don't get confused,  Quantity does not mean either Quality or a good price. Lots of things to buy,  in fact an enormous amount of goods in a smallish area but at a largish price. Comparing Thailand,  Malaysia,  Shenzen,  Vietnam,  this place is the most expensive by far."
12,2.0,"Products in Doota are not cheap at all, but the quality is good.Some salespeople are rude and not friendly to foreign tourists."
13,3.0,"Dongdaemun is a street in Seoul you must visit if you're planning on some crazy shopping. I read somewhere that after 10PM would be the best time to visit so that was the time I went. It was really overwhelming (especially since I just landed in Seoul at 6PM that day) and very crowded! Stick close to your buddies as some of the shopping areas can be confusing to a newbie. If you survive though, you can find some good stuff at affordable prices! :)"
14,4.0,the building was huge and so many stuff and narrow.need nego every purchase.with small kids hard to travel.but for sure atractive place for young shopper!
15,4.0,"We live walkin distance from Dondaemun so thought it was appropriate to write a quick review.Pretty easy to get around, just a lot of nooks and crannies to venture off into. Night time the place comes alive as a true multi-cultural experiance. Foriengners from all over the globe appear when the lights come on. We love to go down at night to see the lights but if you really want to shop go during the day, starting about 10 AM. Plan to kill a full day here. If you are shopping get off the subway at Dongdaemun History and Culture Center.........if you want to see the Gate and Seoul Fortress Wall go on to the next subway stop at Dongdamun Station."
16,5.0,I have a great shopping time....don't miss it and beware of your own wallet....you will be hypnotize by your own wallet hahahahaaa
17,3.0,Come here and prepare a lot of money if you are into shopping. It's all about shopping here and there! I did have a great time here and got some nice sweaters since I came in winter!!
18,5.0,"For anyone that is shopaholic like me, this place is not to be missed. we were there off and on for 4 days and yet we couldnt finish all. Good tips do check out Dotta Food court. The food are pretty good and you get a nice view of the whole street."
19,4.0,"Wasn't really able to explore the entire shopping complex due to lack of time, but I was able to check out Doota as it was close to Good Morning City. I don't remember whether I purchased anything here, but I did like going around for some window shopping."
20,4.0,For the shopping enthusiast! Break out your walking shoes! Plan on going again when I visit next time.
21,4.0,Lots and lots of fabrics and fashion materials one could imagine. It's like a maze. You could spend a day in there without knowing the time.
22,4.0,The choices for fashion items are just overwhelming. The food choices are not as good as the other places. Nice and cheaper place to buy souvenir items though.
23,5.0,"it is the only shopping in the world that i visit where the malls are open for 24 hors 7 days a weekanything you think of you can find in these complex, expensive and cheap items"
24,5.0,"Love shopping and if you would like to get items based on your budget, you can buy a lot. What a busy place..we came back twice to this area."
25,4.0,Choice of shopping malls from high-price to low-price. Bustling at night. Street food stalls are also available along the walkway. Easy to reach by subway and safe to visit at night.
26,3.0,"I went there thinking I would come home with a bag full of cool and unique things that I would buy on the cheap... Ended up leaving with a lot of expensive things bought at department stores...Things that are cheap here now... are very cheap in terms of quality. They have some very nice things, but you are paying retail prices for off name brand items... I would prefer to just shop here.I will say that a lady who sold me clothes a couple years ago recognized me, and even gave me the (almost) same deals as before. I will seek her out on the next visit.Other than that, Korea is westernized, so expect to find everything you would find anywhere else, at a very high price."
27,3.0,"We came here to get a hanbok for my daughter. Found the shop at 2FL (near esclator) , Bargain from KRW80K to KRW60K.There are a few priced at KRW45K (special promotion) We bought a few hair piece at KRW3K... As it is winter most of the shops sell only winter clothing,Prices are cheaper than Malaysia .Most shop open till wee morning"
28,1.0,"we went to the shopping place in Dongdaemum on our first day at Seoul. we took quite a while to find the way to the shopping centre. when we finally found our way there and enter into the Doota shopping centre, we were greeted by this very rude staff. we wanted to look at the clothes but the moment we took up the shirt, one of the female staff asked us to put it down in a very rude manner. it was really a bad experience for us, we will not go back to the place again."
29,5.0,"After I went to some places, I found out that this place sold souvenirs the cheapest one. There were 2 main souvenir shops at level 5 inside the mall. The seller amazingly could speak Bahasa. Maybe because many Indonesia or Malay people also shop there. No need to bargain but in the end, the cashier would give directly a discount."
