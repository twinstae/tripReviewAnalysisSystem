The sakura there was unbelievable and relatively less crowded, so you can actually have a picnic and enjoy the view from the top.  Can also hike from Naksan park down along the way to DongDaeMun in around an hour if taking your time to take in everything.  Would definitely recommend, even those with children."

3,4.0,"Naksan Park - In Korean ‘nakta’ means camel and ‘san’ means mountain and therefore its camel hump-like appearance. Reaching the park requires a moderate hike uphill from Hyehwa Station in Daehangno for about 450 meters. Located in the center of the Seoul, this historical and beautiful park has panoramic views of the entire city. A portion of the old Seoul Fortress Wall runs (Seoul Seonggwak) built during the Joseon Dynasty for protection against invaders and enemies runs through the park. The serene ambience is a perfect gateway from the city bustle. Its scenic beauty makes it a popular filming location for many Hallyu dramas. Take in the sunset views or stay till evening for twinkling lights of Seoul at Naksan Park. If you head to the eastern side (as you look at the mountain) follow the wall downwards to reach the top of Ihwa Mural Village. Alternatively, hike the downhill stretch to Dongdaemun Gate. If you're deadbeat after the walk, just take bus no. 3 at the top of the park to get off at Dongdaemun station. Directions: Take Subway Line 4 to Hyehwa (Exit 2). Walk 70 meters and make the first left where there is the sculpture for Marronnier Park. Continue on Daehak-ro 8ga-gil for 180 meters until it dead ends and make a right. Continue for 50 meters and make at the second left on to Guldari-gil. Continue uphill for 200 meters to reach the park on the left."

The park is spread down the hill, within the hilly park there were seats, a small pavilion with wooden platform for sitting and at the very bottom of the park a good collection of outdoor exercise equipment if this is your thing.  Leaving the park we took the long set of wooden stairs down into the neighbourhood of Daehangno.  I would suggest hiking in this direction as the opposite direction walking towards Dongdaemun I would think would be more challenging."
5,4.0,"This was a good place to hike. It was very hot however and lots of uphill climb to get to the top. We however did this during mid-day, so the sun was strong. It is located right in the Seoul old city wall, so that was neat. But be prepared for a steep climb. At the top, there were some pavilions to rest in, which was nice considering the climb. There is an easier, longer walk I believe to the top, but we did the stairs. It is also located close to the mural village. Would recommend, but probably better to do later in day for night view or early in morning before sun is at strongest."
6,5.0,I went there in winter. I think it's a bit cold but if you go to top of the park between park and Ihwa mural you will see the beatiful city views. And you will see the cute village called Ihwamurall.
7,4.0,"The art murals are so-so and many are abit dated. However, it is still a place worth visiting as you get to see some of the cultural arts and the great views @ the submit. There are shops renting uniform cosplay and many local students renting them for photo shoots."
8,5.0,"If you're looking for a moderate hike along a part of the old wall of the city, then I highly recommend this.  The views are pretty amazing.  You can see the mountains, skyline, including the N Seoul Tower.  We didn't hike the entire section.  If you're taking the metro here, get off at the Dongdaemun station and take exit 10.  Cross the street and start your hike.  Walk along the wall until you get to the main park on your left.  From there, you can gradually walk down the path and stairs.  You'll find a convenience store and bathrooms.  Make your way down and you'll find yourself in an artsy neighborhood of galleries, restaurants and cafes.  Once you get yourself to Daehak-ro, you'll see the Line 4 Hyehwa station."
9,5.0,"A nice walk from the subway. You will pass by the Street Art Village, it's a quiet serene albeit steep climb up to the fortress wall but well worth the night view. We went around evening time, 7 pm when it was still bright, but the gentle breeze and dipping moon made the walk worthwhile. After the walk, you can walk back to the subway, and there are many eateries and shops due to the universitys located near it."
10,4.0,It is located next to Ihwa Mural Village and we took the chance to visit the park.  We went there in the morning and were able to take a look at the city from above.  Expected to have nice view at night but we did not return due to other schedule.
11,5.0,"we went on sunday morning. It was really quiet. We walked about 1 hour and half. The trail starts next to the Dongdaemoon gate. The trail goes next to many private houses on the hill. I saw locals going home from the trails. It is beautiful during the fall as the trees turn colors. I picked up some nice ginko leaves (the yellow ones). I have never been to this side of Seoul and it was nice to see that in the middle of the city, there is a park and trail. it was beautiful."
12,4.0,"Our family of four's primary objective was to explore Ihwa Mural Village. We were busy taking pictures of murals along the narrow and steep road and did not realize that we have reached the entrance of the Park. We saw the staircase leading to the top of the park and decided not to climb up the steps as my elderly family members were a bit tired after walking up the steep road. Nevertheless, we were happy that we have reached here. The air was fresh and had a good view of the city. There were some interesting sculptures in the vicinity and the autumn leaves were beautiful. On our was down, we were thrilled to witness a movie shooting scene in action."
13,4.0,"Many drawing on the house and view are nice, also can enjoy the red leaves in seoul when you go with the right timing!!!"
14,4.0,Went to this park for a short walk after visiting the mural village. Went to 2 out of the 3 observations points and had a great view of the city. Recommended to come if you're heading up to the mural village.
