0,4.0,"Tucked away in a little neighborhood, this museum is a small, intimate experience of a terrible chapter in the history of World War II. The English audio guide walks visitors through the little building, where art, personal stories, and artifacts tell the painful stories of “comfort women,” sex slaves who served the Imperial Japanese Army after being abducted and forced into service. A ‘must see’ destination to understand how widespread violence against women was a historical reality that has yet to end. Stories of sexual violence that continues today in other parts of the world are also reflected in an included exhibit. Appropriate for youth ages 13 and older (many of the sex slaves were younger at the time of their kidnapping). I was glad to see both young women and men taking their time to thoughtfully proceed through the museum."
1,5.0,"Well done museum with the purpose to educate about the approx 200,000 ""comfort women"" or victims of sexual Slavery inflicted systematically by the Japanese government in WWII. Important to know this history in order to not repeat history and to bring awareness to other areas of the world where women are the victims of rape and violence.  Not easy to find but do your planning and you'll find it (and follow the yellow butterflies). 3,000 admission. There are bathrooms and refreshments. Ok to go solo, there is a great audio guide. If you are in town on a Wednesday, there are protests in front of the Japanese Embassy."

4,5.0,"An important museum, but not a fun one.  A taxi from the World Cup metro cost about $5-6, and the driver missed the narrow, alley like street you have to go up. Afterwards I had a beer at the bar back down the hill by the main intersection and walked to Hongkik Metro. A good museum for solo visitors, as you get an audio guide for the exhibits. But it's also good if you have someone to debrief with."
