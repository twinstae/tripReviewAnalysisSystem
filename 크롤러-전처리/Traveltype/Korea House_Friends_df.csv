1,1.0,"We request to book a table for dinner uso y their website twice, but not response. You can check the confirmation using their site; but is always as “checking” .... they dont even bother to inform you that is full."

3,2.0,"We went to see a show here, without the dinner. The place is really beautiful. However they allow cellphone use during the performance, so as the show was starting, everyone of the tourists in front of us took out their phone and they were recording it all and taking pictures all the time, blocking our view with the phones, it was really really annoying, and they kept doing it all the show. The show was really good, good story, everyone can understand it, they don't speak a lot in Korean so you're not missing anything. It was really funny but also really connected to the Korean culture. They have live music with some really cool instruments we don't have here in the West. The show was really worth while but I think the phone thing made us enjoy it much less. If you go I would recommend going to the front row so you don't get the view blocked from the phones."

5,5.0,The food was ok but the show was very good. I loved how they interacted with the audience.I also loved that we go to explore the traditional houses that belonged to Korea House.
6,5.0,"I was looking for a Korean tradition that would exposed me to the various forms of Korea performing arts. I found it exactly here at Korea House. This is my friends and I first time in Korea. I booked only the performance a few days before arriving and received a confirmation right the next day. However, I mistaken the day of my reservation and came a day early. The ticketing ladies were so generous to switch my reservation for me. One of them also spoke good English. The performance was for 1 hour and KW50,000 (~$45) and the story line was easy to follow. The performance was a combination of performing arts, live music, and projections. The plot remained relatively simple and as a foreigner language wasn't an issue in following the story. All in all, truly excellent. Highly highly recommended."
