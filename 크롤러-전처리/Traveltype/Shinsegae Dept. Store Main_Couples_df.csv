Tax free floors are 8-12 (not very well advertised), but we found it overrated with not much bargains. Also they only accept USD in duty free and you need your passport (or photo of it) and flight details to buy."
1,4.0,"If you’re into food then you might enjoy visiting here. They have food kiosks mainly korean, nice high end grocery, deli section with all sorts of cheese and cakes and sweets area."
2,4.0,"If you are looking for the latest selection in designer brands, you will find a good selection here at Shinsegae. There are many international brands here as well as a good selection of Korean brands. A good place to get what you need including food stuff from the supermarket."
3,4.0,"Back home in the UK traditional department stores are now rare, and only really found in large cities, perhaps due to our obsession with online shopping.  Here in Korea they seem to thrive and they really are very good.The Shinsegae Department Store, located near to the 'cosmetic quarter' is huge, an imposing and impressive building.  With 15 floors of goods and foods to browse, you really do need to know what you are looking for, otherwise you may need a search party to find you after a few hours.Decor is sleek, acres of marble and refined bling.  It really is quite an experience and well worth a trip."
4,3.0,"The usual - perfumes and cosmetics on the ground floor, mini high end food court and supermarket in the basement, brand names on the other floors. Nothing amazing."
5,5.0,"My wife and I like fashion, people watching, and shopping.  This place is freaking off the chain.  It is literally mind freaking blowing.  Nearly anything you want to find, this place will have it.  There is also some food an dining there, and it's top notch.  I'd totally go back again."
6,5.0,"This store only carries high end goods, so if you are looking for a deal, this might not be the place for you. It is however extremely nice and everyone was very friendly. The bottom floor is where you need to go. That is where the food court is along with a nice grocery store. The food at the food court is as good as it gets! We had the best rice bowls there. We actually went back multiple times."
7,2.0,"This is for the branch at Myeongdong.At the balenciaga boutique - the service was horrid.A young woman was there, on the telephone, and refused to reply when I asked her if there was menswear and men’s bags. I literally stood in front of her waiting for her to finish her phone call and asked her which branch sold menswear.She replied: No. and went back to her call.I asked if she understood English, she glanced back at me and said: Yes.And turned away back to her back office.Lucky she was the only one like this. All other sales people I encountered in Seoul were amazing."
8,5.0,Prices are the same than lotte duty free but they give more free items. Becomes a member and look for promos in service Center. Bought item from lotte for 70 usd in shinsegae same price but 30$ more free gifts and discount Spent 50 get 5$ off Spend 100 get 10 offIt’s a master card promo
9,4.0,"Like another other Duty Free shopping malls eg. Lotte. Not sure which is better. But i'd prefer the one at Express Bus Terminal Station, whereby they have lots of stores for food at their basement level which is a food heaven! Do drop by there if you have the time."
10,4.0,"We had read reviews that this is a must visit place, especially about the food court here.Everything about Shinsegae is unmistakably upmarket. It has very beautiful decor & classy ambience .Atmosphere is nice & cosy. So many top brands products. The supermarket ( not very big though) products are well packaged & looked so fantastic.Food court sells international food, including an Indian food cuisine.Obviously as expected, prices here are upmarket too ie very expensive.It is located very near to Myeondong Shopping Street, Namsan Park & Namdaemun Market. Just come for an experience, when visiting the other 3 places.For your ""eyes"" only; but not your pockets ....."
11,3.0,We drop-by here after came back from Nami Island trip. Pretty much nothing for us coz we not going to do any shopping. But this is a right place for the luxury shoppers.
12,5.0,"Te first place I visited this department store was the basement food court.  Similar to a lot of mega Japanese department stores, Shinsegae's food court is just amazing.  There is a supermarket where you can find traditional Korean ingredients and other western food.  There are also stores that sells wine and cheese, ice-cream, Korean snacks, fruit, chocolate, bakery......  Some of those even offer taste testing so you can find your favorite before you buy.For the rest of the department store, you can find luxury brands of cosmetic, women and men clothing, sport wear, footwear etc.  There are also a duty free stores on the top floor.  Do bring your passport if you want to buy some luxury items to bring home. Shinsegae Dept store is just next to Myeongdong and Namdaemum market.  Go visit the department store and you won't be disappointed."
13,4.0,"After checking out the huge Lotte Dept. Store we had a look around here. Lotte was ok with a fine food court. But Shinsegae beats Lotte clearly. Everything looks a bit cleaner, a bit better, a bit more professional. There's a big selection for clothes, kitchenware and electronics. But some stuff has crazy high prices. Then - like Lotte - there's the huge Duty Free Section with some good deals (especially on Korean Snacks).The real highlight for us was the lovely food court (with a nice luxury supermarket with fresh fish, seafood and meat). Nice little restaurants and food stalls. Try the Al Tang “Korean Hot Spicy Fish Roe Soup at the Sushi Bar!Besides that don't miss out on the lovely rood terrace. It's an actual small park with some fountains and lots of green. And even some cherry blossoms! Great if you wanna catch a quick breath from all the shopping. Absolutely wonderful!After checking out this nice store don't forget to visit the nearby Namdaemun Market.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
14,4.0,"It's food court in the basement is similar to Harrods except better than Harrods..if you want to have a nicer meal,  go up to the 11th floor where there are a few restaurants. We tried the Korean beef hot pot noodles at the Korean restaurant 甜蜜 which was pretty good. The flavor wasn't too overpowering and wasn't spicy,  which is rare for Korea."
15,5.0,This store is huge! Located in such a good spot in Myeongdong. Food court down stairs is really good too
16,4.0,"We were staying across the road at Hotel Mido. Ate lunch at the food hall. Wide range of food ranging from Vietnamese, Indian to Korean food. We went for the Korean food. Ate at 2 Korean food stalls, sharing the food so we could eat more variety. Menus have English description with pictures. At one stall we ate a spicy octopus rice. At another, we ate a spicy rice roll and a bowl of spicy cold noodles. Good Korean food at food court prices. What a find! Would have cost more if we ate the same thing down in tourisy  myeongdong"
17,5.0,"Why don't we have a department store like this in The Netherlands? With all luxury brands in one store and some cheaper brands as well. However you have to bring a lot of money if you want to buy something nice. And the foodcourt and foodmarket are brilliant too. You can eat japanese, korean, indian, mexican, italian, etc."
18,5.0,"There are a few eateries in the department store and most of them look good - once you find them, that's it!There is an ""interactive"" map on each floor, using which you can locate your destination - once you located English button on it :)The 5F, where most of the eateries are, is reached via 4th floor walkway. The place isn't overcrowded, and you are served very promptly. The menu available in English, but there are only names of the dishes - and you have to guess what's in them! On some level, it makes ordering great fun, but if you decide to forgo the element of surprise, there is a waiter/waitress who could try to explain some basics (and they are literally basics!): pork/beef/chicken/no meat/ that's good/that's very good. After that - go for it, because the meals are fun. I tried ""medicinal red ginseng chicken soup"" only to discover that:The delicious broth also contains oysters (those allergic to seafood - beware!), the chicken is actually a whole poussin, AND the poussin is stuffed with rice, ginseng, garlic, and dried fruit. The result is delicious, filling, but doesn't make you too heavy. The cost is 25000 KWR. The hot stone bibimbap is also worth the try - it is straight forward to mix, very fresh, and the result is delicious. The restaurant has a decent wifi (this is a rarity!), the seats are comfortable and the staff is polite."
19,4.0,"Was visiting the Namdaemun market just behind the Shinsegae Main store.Stark contrast between upper class shopping and low mid class just a street across.Posh marque cars line the street outside Shinsegae.  Step into the mall and you feel you're in another zone altogether.This is luxury mall if you can afford it. And yes I did not leave this mall empty handed ;)Even if nothing catches your fancy, feel free to stroll through the floors and enjoy the different ambience. And you've got good food choices on the basement floor."
20,3.0,"Went to this and another store and it was mostly high-end shopping with brands such as LV, Gucci, Coach etc being prominently displayed.While my wife browsed the ladies' clothing and cosmetics departments,  I had a rather enjoyable time checking out the supermarket and food areas, where they literally have everything from ripened huge strawberries to sundried fish, as well as mentaiko (fish roe) to kimchi and wagyu beef.There was also a great variety of breads, cakes and cheeses.  They did not provide samples, unfortunately, but they were well packaged and packed so that you can buy some for your long plane journey home, if needed."
21,5.0,a lot of good selected shops and boutiques in this department. enjoy shopping and just watching around for hours.
22,4.0,"It seemed to me like a Macy’s in New York without all of the glittering decorations. he department store had American Music, all of the advertisements had American girls and every store could be found in America. I have some allergies to perfume and this place really had such a strong perfume smell because of all the samples being given out and placed on potential customers. The prices on cosmetics were pretty good according to my wife even though I find the duty free at the airports cheaper. I liked that you can show your passport and get a rebate on the taxes you paid so that was pretty cool except for we were with our in laws and they know how to do that. Had I been by myself there would be no way I could have done that because you have to go across the street then down some escalator to like a secret passage that it wouldn’t be worth my trouble. The place made my wife happy so I’m ok with that."
23,5.0,"Very big and nice building before going in,very nice decorated, marble floor, wow, grant in korea. Women clothes varieties and designs mostly smart. Mutiple international famous brands. Room temperature setting was good, not too hot, no need to take off my jacket. Nice to walk around."
24,3.0,Not my favourite shopping location in Seoul.  Found it a little more difficult to navigate.  Has two buildings - one is more high end.  In the end it is shopping and I am usually forced to go
25,4.0,"The Shinsegae location in Busan is larger (in fact, it's the Largest Department Store in the World), but this one's big enough to be getting along.If you love the experience of, say, Harrod's in London, the Galeries Lafayette of Paris, or Milan's Corso Como, this is for you. It's a comparable experience. Mega-sized, with high-end offerings around every corner, it is fun to explore and get lost amidst an ocean of stuff.Staff are friendly and accommodating, and probably keenly aware that most of us aren't really here to buy much.Recommended for everyone… Highly Recommended, if this is your kind of place."
26,4.0,"Quite similar to other department store such as Lotte, this store also carries luxury brands. Located near to Namdaemun Market."
27,5.0,Simple floor layout with excellent visual merchandising and promotional materials. A wide variety of international and local labels for shoppers to choose from. Those hungry after some splurging can fuel up with the huge food selection in the basement.
28,4.0,Shinsegae Dept Store is one of the upmarket shopping centre in central Seoul. It houses international renowned fashion brands with a wide selection of Korean designer products. Shinsegae is the place to go if you are looking for something expensively fashionable.
29,4.0,"One of the best restaurants in Seoul for kalbi-tang is on the 10th floor.  They have a nice coffee shop on the main shopping floor, you can purchase pastries as well.  You can satisfy your western craving for bread products as well - a couple of good bakeries which sell whole-wheat bread, muesli buns, good selection of imported jams, etc.  Ladies, if you are anything more than a US size 6-8, forget about finding any clothing here that fits.  Go downstairs to the market and you'll have many choices.  I always purchase traditional Korean cookies/sweets for my friend's mother, a Korean lady in her 90s when I am there.  The store itself if spotlessly maintained, and a nice reprieve for a coffee, cake and or bread purchase when you are in the area."
