0,5.0,"It's a little ""museum"" with high entertainment value. Entrance costs 9000 won. On Saturday afternoon the place was packed with families. Even though I came here alone, I had a lot of fun. It'd be better to bring someone along to take photos of each other though. The location of the museum wasn't signposted, maybe because it moved to a new location recently. It's on the B1 level of the SM Duty Free building, although it does not appear on the floor map at all. It's within a walking distance of Alive Museum, so you can combine the two easily."
1,3.0,"I personally find it interesting and humorous, this place is small and activities are short and you will be done in 15mins. i personally would prefer to do something else, this is not for me."
