0,3.0,Normal large store by Seoul main train station. Divide over 3 floors it has plenty of options of male and female clothing.
1,3.0,"Went there as it listed in the shopping place to visit.  We bought something from North Face because it is a good discount. If you have a specific brand in mind and know what you are looking for, worth giving a try. It's conscience as it is located  next to the Seoul station."
2,5.0,"Lotte outlet is right outside Seoul Station.  During weekends, there are lot of outdoor stalks selling clothing and handbag.  Price is really good too (5000W to 10000W for a sweater, 40%-70% mark-down on brand name purses).The Lotte supermarket is the one that I visited most.  It has a lot of Korean food, snacks, produce, cosmetics and house hold items.  Price is better than the smaller supermarket in the city.  There are a lot of taste testing too.  You can try some of them before you make the decision.The supermarket is always crowded and there is long line-up for cashiers. Do bring plastic bag or grocery as bags are not free.  Also bring your passport for tax refund if you spend more than 30,000W."
3,3.0,"A big shopping outlet conveniently located around Seoul station. If you like shopping, you may enjoy this place but to us, its not much different from other shopping outlets and departmental stores. Lots of Korean stuff you can buy."
4,4.0,"Just another place where you can find lots of options for your shopping season... is there a special feature on this type of places? No. Just go around and if you find any interesting product, clothes or whatever you are looking for... for sure you will enjoy it."
5,3.0,"Walked past them every day during my stay and only went in once. Nothing special really, for the tourist. The best being the Lotte Mart where you can stock up on groceries cheaper that the little 24H shops dotted around. If you are going to buy a few things (over 30,000) then take your passport and you can get one the spot tax refund."
6,5.0,"Seoul mart is the place to go for all local food, it's a large supermarket and carries food, makeup lines, small appliances and more.  It's the one place to go to buy back souvenirs, loaded with fresh fruits I was driven to walk down all the aisles, careful not to miss corner.  What we love is also how clean, orderly and fresh everything is.  Must try their pears, it's the size of a American grapefruit, sweet and delicious."
7,3.0,"The style doesn't let me feel like it is an outlet, more like a department store!! It does have discount products."
8,2.0,Didn't get to buy anything. Maybe its the season. Mostly winter wear at this time of the year. I only spent less than an hour browsing through. The prices are not that cheap as well. Waste of time.But you should visit the lotte mart nextdoor with better bargains of snacks and some cosmetics.
9,5.0,"i made two trips here. I for use during the trip, and another to take home. Bring your own shopper's bag. Boxes are provided for packing but it's a fix size box and quite small so if your returning airline only allow one checkin luggage, it your be better to repack again.There's EMS delivery just beside the tax refund counter for bulky items."
