0,3.0,"History:This park has some historical significance as others have mentioned already. It’s the first modern park that was established in Seoul. A 15th century 10-story pagoda is encased in glass but it’s not easy to get a great picture of. There are also monuments that signify Korea’s Declaration of Independence from Japan in 1919.Evaluation: It’s a very small park. I spent about 30 minutes here and that was enough. Many older men come here to relax. If you’re going to Insadong, you can stop here since it’s close to there. If not, you don’t need to bother. Location: Jongno-3-ga Station, Exit 1"

3,3.0,"We visited Tapgol Park in our attempt to visit the maximum possible number of Seoul’s tourist and historical sites. There are few Statues and Monuments in the park including the famous “10 Storied Stone Pagoda” which was covered by a huge protective glass case. In my opinion and despite the historical significance, this is a nice place to visit to “tick a box” but not a must visit."
4,4.0,"It is an amazing place. When this park was created in 1913 it was the first Western style park in Korea. Prior to that it was the site of Buddhist temple. The towering Joseon Pagoda now protected from weather elements comes from 15th century. The proclamation of Korean independence from Japanese rule in March 1919 took place here. This little park is loaded with history!Nowadays it is also a spot where peaceful elderly gentlemen sit on benches and socialize.The best way to visit the Topgol Park is to first walk the perimeter and look at the stellas on the walls of the park. The relieves depict dramatic historic events in allegorical way. This is a very special place for anybody interested in Korean history. The ""exhibit"" culminates in the form of the Monument of Declaration of Korean Independence and in accompanying statues.Topgol park is south of Insadong."
