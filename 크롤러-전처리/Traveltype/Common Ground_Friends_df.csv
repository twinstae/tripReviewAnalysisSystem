2,5.0,"Itâ€™s a hot place in Seoul fr photo shooting, use  blue cargoes to built that places, lots of shops and restaurants.Get the green line 2 subway, exit 6 at Konkuk uni, walk 3 mins straight. Easy to find it."
3,4.0,"C ( 18.01.04 ) I and my friend visited this complex on our way to Konkuk University station. There was small area, but had unique shape made by container. We visited at night, there was good atmosphere and mood."
4,3.0,"Common ground is a unique shopping destination with a number of small shops and eateries (on the top floor). The place has two sections with one dedicated to mainly menswear while the other has a variety of stores with some womenswear. However, the prices of clothes in the menswear section are generally higher than what you might get on the street, while the stuff in the other section is not dissimilar to what you can find in other stores around Seoul. Additionally, it was smaller than I expected and therefore it did not take us long to get through the complex. Thus I wouldn't say that this is a must-see location unless you wish for a spot to take cute photos or to see its interesting architecture!"
5,4.0,"Nice hang out place where you can find restaurants, cafe and shopping under one roof. Wide variety of international cuisine."
6,4.0,"Very different sort of market compared to anything that i have ever gone to in the past. The whole market is made from renovated shipping containers and very open and has plenty of rooftop restaurants and bars, while the rest is made up of international retail brands and a few small independents. We arrived at the end of May when there was a Korean Craft Beer Festival on and it was great and packed to the max. Very cool place with music and art and very easy to get to using the subway. I will say that I was a little disappointed that there weren't more independent shops but maybe that will change in the future with more unique events and festivals at it."
7,3.0,Stylish shopping mall. There are many people posting outside for a nice facebook/IG shot. Inside is a mall in which the garments are quite expensive. There are cafe and restaurants at the rooftop. It is sufficient to spend within an hour here. Can consider link this place to Garak Market for seafood dinner.
8,5.0,"Nice shops (especially for guys), nice restaurants and cafÃ©s to chill at. If you're in Seoul for shopping it's definitely worth a visit even if it's a bit far off from downtown."
9,4.0,"This place is suited for the young and hip since there's nothing much you can do here but appreciate the huge blue shipping containers and take pictures. The shops inside are quite expensive. If you feel like having a light snack, you can also head down to the food trucks on the market ground.Oh, did I mention a DJ inside the Market Hall?"
10,5.0,"This place is very hip, and majority of the people that I saw were the younger crowds. It's basically a bunch of containers put together to make a mall. Very interesting concept to say the least. It's the first I've seen and was excited to see it, and definitely met my expectations. You have your usual stores on the inside from clothes to accessories and trinkets. Outside of the containers, there's a few food trucks with a nice patio on the ground floor. On the way top, they have an outside walkway with even more food options.  Definitely a place to see for the younger generation."
11,4.0,Walkable distance from train station! Go there in your best ootd and a good photographer :D there are quite a few good food places nearby too.
12,3.0,An interesting concept shopping place. There's cafes at the top floors and the other floors are retail shops. It's small so don't expect to do much shopping here. Most of the retail shops are aimed for youngsters and are more on the pricey side.Recommend to come here just for a short visit and photo taking.
13,4.0,"We went here last week to check out new place in seoul. We found it is very cool with food trucks, cafes, and shopping zone. It is also a cool place to take photo and lot of photos."

There are a lot of cafes too, so it is worth the visit.Please check on my vlog for more information (EN CHANNEL): search by title#7 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 6 SEOUL - DIOR CAFE - COMMON GROUND"
15,4.0,We spent an hour or so visiting this hip pop-off complex using 20ft and 40ft containers. They convert them into stores selling local and international brand and restaurants/coffee shops. Definitely targeting a younger crowd but worth visiting.
16,5.0,"It's a cool space with lots of clothing and accesories shop, mostly appealing to a younger crowd but really fun and casual even for the older crowd. DJ booth with great music as well."
17,3.0,"A shopping center made of containers,goods sold mainly for young people. There are shops and food trucks."
18,3.0,"My friends from Bangkok wanted to check out this place so we visited after grabbing lunch in the area. Common Ground is near Kunkuk University so it's totally catered for the young hipster crowd. It's basically a pop-up store made up of blue shipping containers and it's 3 stories high with shops. They have unique stores with accessories, stationaries, clothing, shoes, bags and restaurants. They have food trucks too so you can eat outside when the weather is nice. I was surprised to see a small art gallery so you can also check out some artworks. Visiting the Common Ground was perfect on a chilly day with friends. We didn't get to eat there but I did see many different cuisines. I'm not sure if I would go again unless my friends or family really want to go. Merchandise were a bit pricey so we didn't get to buy a lot but I did purchase a few cards that were unique."
19,4.0,Kind of Interesting placesContainer structure with plenty of goods(Most of them are not that expensive and fancy)Also keeping going on Events at thereUntil 12.11 You can see a lot of penguins. ðŸ˜Š
20,3.0,"It was really catered to the university crowd generation - food wise, clothing wise, and general feel. College kids are just there to take pictures with their significant others. A selfie world. Cute trinkets, but nothing much to buy unless you want that up & coming label. We did have the famous rainbow cake at Dore Dore.This place allows young Korean designers to operates their own shop with their own clothing lines and accessories, which I found it really great and on the trend. The Common Ground building by containers looks really amazing and a very good place to take a picture.come here if you want to see upcoming new designers showcasing their designs. buy them before they become uber famous. one day you will find them in upscale shopping areas. great place to chillax."
21,3.0,"It was really catered to the university crowd generation - food wise, clothing wise, and general feel.  College kids are just there to take pictures with their significant others. A selfie world.  Cute trinkets, but nothing much to buy unless you want that up & coming label.  We did have the famous rainbow cake at Dore Dore (which has exploded over all of Seoul with multiple locations).  The cakes look amazing.. the taste not so much.  Basically it was layers of dry cake with the taste of food colouring wrapped in cream cheese.  I was expecting so much more; maybe bec' I'm a baker (hobby)/cake lover.  H/E, even my Korean friend was disappointed.  I guess it's the whole ""Korea follow a trend thing"" - the reason for the popularity of this cafÃ© shop.  Visit Common Grounds if this is not your first time in Seoul, or want to avoid the Chinese tourist crowds.  Otherwise, do something else in Insadong/Palace region/Bukcheon/Seoul Tower, if you are short of time.  You'll spend your time more wisely."
22,3.0,"Consisting of stacked storage containers, this little ""mall"" is full of quirky, young-oriented shopping.  This is not necessarily budget shopping, but interesting."
23,4.0,"Shopping Centre built from containers in blue. Common GroundÂ is Korea's first and World's largest Shipping Container Shopping Mall nearby University station inÂ Seoul.There are restaurants, cafes and a number of different types of stores. Also, in the middle of the structures is a food truck area. They offer from various hot dogs to burgers and french fries,a barbeque truck as well as Kimchi Truck with Doritos and wraps. The Kimchi Doritos was tasting weird. Never thought the Kimchi is part of Dorito filling. Disappointed with Doritos.It's definitely worth a visit. Set aside approximately 1 hour."
24,3.0,"A lot of local Koreans come to this place for photos. I guess this place is mainly good for photos, especially if you are a blue fan, but don't expect you can buy a lot from here. The mall is smaller than expected and prices are high."
25,4.0,"Apparently it is the biggest container ""mall"". It is somewhat interesting but the things are quite expensive. We went there as we need to find somewhere cooling to hide from the sun. Haha. Before we left, we went to the cafe called ""Dore Dore"". They sell good cakes and coffee. Worth your $$ (the cafe)."
26,4.0,"I have to say I kinda love this place. If you are looking for cool and hip streetwear clothing, this is the place to shop when you are in Seoul. I found so many cool stuff with good deals.I love the idea of the container type building. Making it look edgy and of course an 'insta-worthy' spot to take photos."
27,3.0,"A place for people to take pictures and upload to Instagram. Apart from the picture point, the mall is little small than expected. Some special shops inside is good to visit. Spend less time than I preferred."
28,3.0,"Made from container. Local deisigners boutiques, restaurant and coffee hang out places.The clothes there are not cheap. There are some DJ playing music in a DJ station in the center.
