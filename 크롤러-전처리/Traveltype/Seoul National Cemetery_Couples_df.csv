0,4.0,"It is the National Cemetery, a huge plot of land in the middle of the city, very well kept.  An impressive memorial to unknown & missing soldiers, along with Arlington Cemetery-like graves.  But this cemetery also includes a museum, photo exhibits, snack bar, convenience store, picnic tables, outdoor performances, so that it is a great (free) gathering place for families and couples, particularly during the current cherry blossom season!  Subway: Dongjak station exit 8;  and there is a parking lot, too."
1,5.0,"if you are interested in Korean history this is a worthwhile place to visit. There are English pamphlets in the ""letter boxes"" that you can take which outlines the history of the cemetery and people buried there.Easy to get to as it right by the subway exit 6 on the number 9 line."
