9,5.0,"If you travel to Seoul, make sure you visited Hongdae!During the evening the street performers come alive, food stalls send amazing smells across the streets enticing you to reach for your pocket and locals shop for bargains.This place is busy, be warned! The atmosphere however is amazing. Every time that I have been I have noticed how friendly everyone is and stall owners try there best to converse with you in English. Along the sides you will find Korean versions of pubs, numerous restaurants and shops that will meet any price range that you are looking for.Head out early, around 6pm. Gives you a chance to gather your bearings and in a way, plan what you want to do. I ended up buying a few beers from a local shop and spent most of the evening listening to music and watching street performers."

We left around 1 am, and there were still musicians performing and people hanging around. This was during summer time, though, so I don't know how it is in the colder months. The area is filled with young people since it's near the university. I had a blast and I really enjoyed the performances!"

23,4.0,"If you are into shopping, one day seems not enough to see everything here. Most of the stalls show stylish apparel that are popular to millenials (since it is near Hongik Univ). Aside from the shops, there are also many places where you can have meals, snacks and desserts. Trick Eye and Love museums are also here. It seems common to see kpop idols in the vicinity. What I like most about Hongdae is the presence of Tourist Info Centers, with very helpful and informative staff (fluent at English too, very favorable for tourists)."
24,5.0,"This is such a nice street, not too long that you cannot get to the end of it but you can easily spend half a day there if you want, just because of how nice it is. It's a very artsy place with both high-end and low-end shops. The food is amazing, and the street food stalls will keep you full if you don't want to stop by a restaurant. The atmosphere was amazing, especially during night, which is really nice considerig how late the shops close. There were lots of street performers that locals and visitors both seem to enjoy and clap along to. Would definitely visit again, probably several times during the same visit in S. Korea."
