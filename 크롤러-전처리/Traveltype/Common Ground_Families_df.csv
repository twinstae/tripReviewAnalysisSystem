1,4.0,"We enjoyed exploring Common Ground just before noon. It opens at 11am. It's certainly a cool space and a cool collection for stores. Perhaps too cool if you're not into the mis of Korean/American skateboarder/DJ type. Collection of shops is esoteric and a bit different from the mainstream, but other than Snow Peak (= Japanese lifestyle / camping brand with unique high quality products) most other shops are somewhat repetitive (fashionable baseball caps, jeans, Dr Martens shoes, sneakers, a bit of jewelry, etc. etc.). Food offerings on the third floor were mostly disappointing. We were quite hungry and looking for options, but opted not to stay for lunch. Felt most of the food (especially the Korean/Chinese, Thai, Analog, Curry) all looked less than appetizing."
2,3.0,"The Common Ground Park at Konkuk University in Seoul is a noveau approach to shopping but it turned out to be quite a let down as the range of clothes and accessories can be found in Myeongdong n Busan but at a slightly higher price. However, it is here that you can take nice and unique photos. If you love cute toys and accessories for phones as well as diaries, this place might just be up your alley. In fact, i find the vicinity near it more interesting to explore where food is concern. Lots of restaurants serving local fare line the back alleys."
3,3.0,"Love the concept, with many little quaint stores selling unique stuff by young entrepreneurs and designers,  However, the prices are not so friendly to the pocket. Few eateries on the 3rd floor, fried chicken & beer, healthy rice and noodle bento, etc. Nice place to chill after browsing the stores."

5,3.0,"his place is is made by many blue cargo boxes,It   a container concept shopping mall .This place is small with no Elivator. The food and cafes ok .But,I did not like Shopping products, I came to this place because my wife told me she read about this place from famous blogger in Kuwait. In fact when we arrive to this place I found low class product and nothing interesting for me or my family.In my opinion this place good for take photo or have drink in the cargo not for shopping."
6,4.0,"We spent five nights in Seoul and once we got the hang of the train system, I was glad our family of four stopped by the Common Ground container park for lunch. We didn't really explore the neighborhood but didn't sense we were missing much, so it was a hop on and hop off to go to the next place experience.We enjoy container parks overall, for the funky idea and different types of shops and eateries and this was no exception. There were some interesting food trucks permanently parked on the bottom level but one daughter expressed interest in a restaurant on the second level so that's where we went. We spent about an hour wandering the shops and taking pictures but didn't buy anything other than food. There was an awesome dj downstairs dancing and playing American music, mixing from different decades. We stayed longer just to hear what tunes he'd play and left after he took a break."
7,4.0,Great attractions! Container built outlook with many shops of fashion and accessories for both men and ladies. There are also having different style restaurants and cafes for relaxing while you want to take a break during shopping. We missed this place last year and specially visited it this time. It's a nice place!
8,3.0,"This place just seem over-rated.No point taking the trouble to reach here from far. Just a place with stores and restaurant made up of container. Only a photo with Common Ground container as backdrop makes it up.We visited here on a afternoon and had our lunch here @ level 3.At most spend 1.5 hours here including lunch session.Guess, the only unique point it's constructed of containers. That's all."
9,5.0,"This place allows young Korean designers to operates their own shop with their own clothing lines and accessories, which I found it really great and on the trend. The Common Ground building by containers looks really amazing and a very good place to take a picture. Hence the cafe Dore Dore is very good I ordered chocolate cake which is limited during my visit is so delicious. Also, travel to the Common Ground is easy just drop off by Anguk University station exit 6, walk straight for about 5 minutes and you will see a blue containers."
