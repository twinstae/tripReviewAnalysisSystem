Long taxi line so we decided to walk and we discovered a place called Maloney's Station right down the street. Cool place with great craft beer, we stayed there till our hotel was ready, checked in, and then went right back to Maloney's station. Good times."

If you go to the Seoul Station, you can also visit this one.  Otherwise, there is no need to just come and see it."

Quickly took us up to the upper level, a modern train station was in front of us.  People are moving fast, everyone is busy and signs are clear to show the direction.  Stepping out the building, the city is in front of us.  Getting down to the taxi station, workers quickly guided us to the next taxi and go."
