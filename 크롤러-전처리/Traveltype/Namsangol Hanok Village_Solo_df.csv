0,5.0,"this is the best place to experience the people staying in hanok those era.  after viewing all the hanoks in this village, feels like staying in a hanok for my next trip just for the experience.  free entrance too."
1,5.0,"Namsangol Hanok Village is very close to Chungmuro subway. It was Chuseok when I went and there was a taekwondo exhibition, lots of food and people walking around wearing hanbok."
2,4.0,"i went in winter so it was very quiet there were a few people around but not many very close to Chungmuro station but i walked from myeongdong so it wasn't very far at all, there is a Hanbok rental store just outside if you want to dress up bit i was flying solo so i passed on that but he village itself was so pretty and fun to explore, i wondered around a bit and stumbeled on a huge time capsule which was quite cool"
3,4.0,The Hanok homes here are lovely but they are only a small part of the appeal of this village. There are some beautiful walking paths and picnic areas in the park around the Hanok. It is a great place for a stroll or picnic. I enjoyed seeing and listening to the babbling stream that winds throughout the village. It is a fabulous place for photos.
4,4.0,"Beautiful place rich of history, better to be with a tour guide to know all the stories behind which will make your visit more enjoyable."
5,4.0,"I walked down from N Seoul Tower and took a quick walk through before heading to my next activity. It was a cold day when I visited, but it was still beautiful. I have a hunch that it would be a little more interesting at night with lanterns and lights and Seoul Tower in the distance. I would say that if you are in the area stop by. If you are going to Bukchon Hanok Village, then I'm not sure that there is anything new here. Although there is a lovely photogenic pond, so it's not a waste of time if you want to see both."
6,4.0,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. It was a quick walk around and we were able to learn a bit about traditional Korean lifestyle and villages. Be sure to duck under the little walkways between buildings because you might hit your head (don't say I didn't warn ya!)"
7,5.0,The village with traditional houses from different places of South Korea. There is the Time Capsule on the territory of that village. 600 hundred items from modern life are buried there in the ground so that 400 years later (when Seoul celebrates its 1000 years anniversary as the capital city) it could be opened by future generation. Amazing!
8,2.0,Pretty empty in my opinion.  Not much going on. Just drab and unexciting.  Not really worth your time checking it out. Free entry.  Metro exit 3
9,3.0,"I enjoyed getting to see the traditional architecture at Namsangol Hanok Village (남산골한옥마을). I think this place is most suited for photographers and those with a strong interest in Korean culture. As a tourist, it was a little underwhelming as it is essentially just walking around and looking at the buildings. There is an area where you can watch martial arts or drink tea but it is otherwise a sight-seeing location only. If you are doing the Seoul City Bus Tour, it's worth taking 30 minutes to stop and look at it as it is free admission."
10,4.0,Went on a day tour that included Namsan Hanok Village. Had a nice walk around this quaint traditional village with beautiful architecture. The guide provided interesting narratives.
11,5.0,"Architecture is beautiful, this place is clean and it is free to get in. This recreation of a traditional Korean village has free shows, plenty of refreshment stands, historic recreations and is also the home to many Korean TV shows. There is a group of student offering free tour. They will answer your question about the village."
12,4.0,"Beautiful, tranquil area in the midst of all the hectic of downtown Seoul. Gives a good understanding of the traditional Korean lifestyle. Try to find and catch the 1 hour Nap Experience for W2000!"
13,3.0,If you have lots of time in Seoul....see this places. But if you have few days and not much time...you can skip this village. It's a bit hard to find if you don't have a map on you mobile!It's a regular old village
14,4.0,I stumbled upon their tea house by chance and had an amazing experience. All by myself in a beautiful and peaceful tea room I had an amazing tea with blooming flowers. Very transcending experience.
15,5.0,Full of atmosphere. Lots going on. Partipation in Korean games. The stream passing thru was very photogenic. Young ladies in costume made it for me.
16,5.0,"This is a place with many traditional Korean homes, moved from areas from around Seoul, almost like a North American pioneer village.Architecture is beautiful, place is clean and it is free to get in. The surrounding park, Namsan park, is lovely in its own right. Both places have many opportunities for photos.Nice outing."
17,5.0,Must see when you visit Seoul. You get to see the traditional houses of Koreans. In here you will also find replicas of some houses of famous people in Korean history. You will also get to see the Time Capsule of Seoul within the area.
18,3.0,"The Admission: FREE admissionThe Village: The ancient village from the Joseon period, traditional Korean houses. Good photo opportunity. You can participate in traditional culture experience programs, reservations are required with fees. The Location: Subway Line 3 or 4, Chungmuro Station. Exit 3 or 4"
19,5.0,"I visited this place after seeing Bukchon and it was nice to see the houses open with furnitures to give a better idea how the people lived in the past. While I was there there was a group studying calligraphy, but I could not see them because the windows were closed. Some of the houses were moved to the village, what I found it was really amazing. There is a courtyard in the back where you can try traditional kids games, unfortunately I could not do because the instructions were in Korean and I did not do the tour. I went there early in the morning and it was quiet. Tourists can try some traditional activities but none were available at the time of my visit.The entrance is free and the place is located in Namsan Park, so it very easy to go from there to N Seoul Tower.To reach Namsangol Hanok Village take the Orange line 3, Chungmuro station exit 3. The entrance is just past the gas station. From there to go to N Seoul Tower, just go to Chungmuro Station exit 2 - just along the street from exit 3, and take the circular bus 2 or 5. You have the opportunity to get off in the bottom of the tower and go up a steep hill or get off close to the cable car."
20,4.0,"The exterors and interiors are meant to be authentic reconstructions,  and by and large they are more chock full of refurbished exhibits. It's a good place to see glimpses of what living conditions may be like in the past, but they look very new. Can be done in 30-40 minutes if not watching a show at the pavilion or strolling through the park behind the reconstructed hanok sets."
21,5.0,"I visited this village on a Sunday end of November, which I believe is the low tourist season for Seoul.Admission to this village is free, and there are free guided tours offered by volunteers.I requested for an English speaking tour, and was given a private tour by an ajusshi who spoke good English. He gave me a great overview of old Korea, the architecture, and the living habits of Koreans.I really enjoyed the 1 hour cultural immersion, and came away with a much better appreciation of Korean culture and history.Will recommend the free guided tour for history buffs and lovers of cultural visits."
22,5.0,This is a great place to learn on the living styles and habits of old Korea. It takes you back to the scenes you would have watched in the television. There is a centre outside the entrance where you could rent a Hanbok for photography too.
23,4.0,We went here during the spring season which is a nice timing to witness the cherry blossom trees. It's great to explore the Korean traditional houses - like you're back in the past. Also you can see the Namsan Tower from afar.
24,3.0,"Thought id so some historical sightseeing so i went to visit the hanok village. Easy to find in Seoul, this place is definitely interesting and get a sense of history of korea. However all you're doing is just walking through old villages and theres nothing informative. Probably spent an hour here, it was alright but once was enough"
25,5.0,"This is a lovely village and garden, smacked in the middle of metropolitan Seoul. The best part of this place is that there is no entrance fee. There are also free guided tours in English, Japanese and Chinese.I was the only person in that tour and I had a private tour cultural tour of the village. My tour guide spoke excellent English and she was very willing to answer all my questions.The gardens surrounding the village is also worth a visit and there are a scatter of art pieces around the garden."
26,5.0,"These yangban (educated upper-class people's) homes did notoriginally exist together but were aggregated in the area to preserve their historical architecture. There are added-on experiences you can purchase, I went for the traditional calligraphy. After a brief lesson, you use brush and ink to write the Hangeul word on canvas. If you do not know Korean, the instructor will  give you a word to use. There is also tea ceremony experience and hanbok (traditional clothes) wearing experience."
27,5.0,"The entrance is free and it looks like the Old village next to the royal palace. It's not a must if you have already seen the Bukchon Palace, but here there are no people living inside the houses and there is a park around the village. Once thing i really like here, you can look inside the rooms, which are furnitured, to have a better impression of how people lived in this houses. That's something i really missed in Bukchon Village and also in the Gyeongbokgung palace. ...Big + for Namsangol Village"
28,5.0,This village is like stepping back into time. If you take a seat on a step and just look around you can picture the everyday life there.
29,4.0,"If you want a sense of how people lived and are happy to wander yourself, quietly in your own time, this is a good option. They have 5 houses to view of varying social levels for you to see how the people lived. You can also book a tea ceremony lesson and try on traditional clothing."
30,4.0,"Interesting traditional village, where you can discover several aspects of Korean culture: architecture, traditions, food,... All this in a very peaceful atmosphere, surrounded by ponds and gardens. If you're lucky, there are traditional dance shows organized for visitors."
31,4.0,"Easy to find and very interesting and attractive,  Good to fill in an hour or two.  Well worth a visit to adsorb some Korean culture."
32,3.0,"Visit this village in the morning and it wasn't crowded at all. Nice to see how the older generation lived but after awhile, they all seem similar. Suitable for a short visit.The whole place isn't that big so it won't take long to walk around."
33,5.0,"Historical village in mid-city, great piece of architecture. It is open to the public. It is very nice walking in to this village and taking pictures."
34,5.0,"If you want to get a sense of Korean home life before modernization, this is a great place to stop.  Near the subway and Namsan mountain."
35,5.0,A very peaceful place....it's a bit like the OK corral in Korea in places. Beautiful structures and serene music playing. ....free WiFi throughout!
36,5.0,"The Hanok Village is close to Chungmuro Metro Station and the admission is free, do pay a visit when you are around the area."
37,4.0,"The village offers a lot of information that you can learn about Korea's rich culture and history. For someone doing a transit tour, the place is really amazing."
38,3.0,"Exit Chungmuro Subway Station and walk a few minutes to the village which is at the base of Nam mountain. It a little small compared to others around Korea but you can see many similar buildings and features. I recommend getting a drink and snacks before entering, I happened to go when they had a martial arts demo and there were many activities for children. I don't think they have these activities everyday. You can spend an hour or two walking around so if you need a break from myeongdong shopping, this is a nice spot."
39,5.0,"the Hanok , living in One of them too is Something no to miss even if you are on a strict Budget, One night of treatment in a Hanok is worthed"
40,5.0,"An old village which they have reserved well. I luckily was here when they held a traditional wedding so it was a unique experience. The landscape, the houses are beautiful. Can also wear hanbok, the professional photographer will shoot for you in one hour and you get two printed photos, plus they send all pictures by email to you a few days later. Love it :)"
41,3.0,"From Seoul station, take a bus to the village. It should be more fascinating as the name is , only very few Korean traditional houses so travelers could rent gowns & have pictures taken as a memory of their trip to Korea.Nothing exciting , just walk around the alleys, drop by to have tea, beverages or some little fast Korean food. Only if you have finished all the interesting attractions, drop by if you have time."
42,3.0,There were few houses on display and getting inside the house is not allowed but you can still see the interior of the house for picture taking.
43,3.0,nice to know a hankok village sits in the center of Seoul. memorable but won't offer anything beyond imagination.
44,3.0,"The buildings are genuine but the ""village"" is an artifice.  Essentially, it is a collection of 5 wealthy families’ homes relocated to this spot and landscaped to appear to represent a natural setting.“Homes” is really a misnomer; these are the equivalent of today’s mansions.  Though not overly picturesque or photogenic, they are, when examined patiently, a good glimpse into household life during that period (including how they used fire pits under the various living quarters as radiant heat).Try to get here as soon as the place opens.  As the day progresses, it will inevitably become completely over-run by busload after busload after busload of Chinese tourists.  At no other sight will you see such a concentrated number of tourists from China.  I don’t know why but this place is apparently a very popular, “must see” sight with all the tour groups.  It amounts to a large number of people occupying a relatively small parcel of land.  At times you will find yourself very distracted.  It’s quite strange because there are no busloads of anyone from any other country.This is far from a “must see” sight.  I would save this as filler at the end of your stay in Seoul; don’t risk sacrificing any prime sight or sights on your list to go here.On Wednesdays and Saturdays there are Taekwondo exhibitions by children and young teens, which adds to the touristy, carnival-like atmosphere.  Keep in mind, the village is closed on Tuesdays; although you can walk the grounds, access to the homes is not possible.I wish they would re-name two stars ""below average"" because ""poor"" has a distinct negative connotation.  I would give it two stars but for that reason."
45,1.0,Please ignore this place as it has nothing interesting or worthy about it .  Totally deserted and barren - went with high hopes only to crash it
46,5.0,"I came here during Korea's summer vacation week - I think. so, when I arrived, there was a 'free walking course' by teenagers - about 16 years old for them to practice English, and also a teacher assists and encourage them to speak english and also introduce how traditional houses build as smart house, i.e : heat from in-door kitchen is circulated to main house."
47,3.0,"This hanok village with its handful of traditional Korean houses was a bit boring for my tastes. The 5 houses all looked the same to me and there wasn't much information about them, apart from who they were built for and when and some architectural details. You could not go inside any of the buildings, so my visit was very short."
48,3.0,If you want to get the feeling of how houses were traditionally furnished this is a good place to go. You can also walk around it in traditional clothing for $5. A great place to take pictures. The houses were moved from other areas so there is a good amount of space to walk around them as opposed to bukchon. Bukchon has more houses but you can only go in the few that are stores or workshops.
49,5.0,"I walked to this village from Chungmuro Station. Seeing how much of a metropolis Seoul is, places like this will bring us to the past. The traditional architecture and art of Korea can be seen here, well preserved and maintained. It's right there, just amongst the tall buildings. Visitors can go for a walk around the village, learn hangeul, play traditional games and try on hanboks. At one of the houses there, traditional hanboks can be rented at less than KRW6000.00, a great bargain compared to other places I've read/found out that charges more. The lady who was in charge of the hanbok rental was very kind. Noticing that I came there as a solo visitor, she helped me took my photos like it was a photoshoot almost everywhere in the house :D The signage there had English translations. The village is a huge area, I wish I I had spent more time there. There's free public wifi in some areas in the village."
50,5.0,"It's free, what else could I say? The place was not too big, but you can see Namsan tower clearly from there. There are few old houses, and good place to take pictures, especially for couples."
51,4.0,"C1 ( 2015.03.21 ) There was located beside Chungmuro subway station, so accessibility was good. This village was consist of some Korean nobleman house, so can't see ordinary people's house. This area was not big than I think. but good place to walk with Korean old house. The location was very good( and free ), so if you're near Myungdong or Namsan, I'll recommand to visit with a light heart."
52,4.0,"Here they made a true copy of a Korean village, there is also a small theater on the premises and a time capsule plus a couple of other things, if you have time check out the Korean house next door."
53,3.0,"The village was close enough to my guesthouse and the metro to walk there.  As other say, it was winter so expect to see brown.  I still enjoyed the visit as a break from shopping malls and crowded metro.  To walk around and have something cultural and historical to see, amidst nature.  There were also a few art exhibits set up, which was an additional nice touch to the place, to give your eyes something additional to feast on."
54,5.0,"I love that place. I wore a hanbok - traditional korean costume and had my photos been taken by a nice korean lady. Also I took a lesson on korean handwriting. I think it`s called hangul, but not sure here. They`re worth it. Really. I tried words sara - love and happiness (but forgot the korean name for it)"
55,4.0,"This place is nice for taking pictures and learn the traditional Korean's visit. This is a big place with some hanok houses (that you can actually see what's on the inside!) as well as the cultural workshops. Nice park, there's a flock of tourists when I visit. But when you go inside, actually, it's not that crowded.There's a Seven Eleven in front of the gate, also you can take pictures with Hanbok Traditional Costumes. Worth a visit."
56,5.0,good place nad nice historical places at korea tradiytional must visit before 18.00 hrs good to visit
57,5.0,The place showcase the traditional Korean houses and other traditional structures.  The entrance is free but you may want to spend a little to tryout their traditional clothes (hanbok).  There are very few tourist when I visited the place and so I find it peaceful and relaxing.
58,4.0,"Namsangol was much better than I had expected, and also a lot more tourists than I had hoped for. I thought most people would go to Bukchon Hanok Village and leave Namsangol relatively quiet. How wrong I was. When I went around noon, there were many groups of foreign tourists and Koreans walking around.Nonetheless, I thought my walk around the village was an enjoyable one. I must say the village is well organized and clean. Once you go through the gate, the enclosure on the left drew my attention. Inside, I went around the houses that were immaculately preserved to show how life in the olden days was. Not only were the houses lovely, but they were so beautifully presented, allowing the visitor to look inside living quarters as though you were a house guest there. I actually spent a good deal of time admiring the architecture and even the smaller, quieter corners of the compound. I wish I had taken the guided tour, though, to enhance my understanding of what was there.There was a stage where some young performers were practicing for a martial arts show, which was captivating. Very near to Chungmuro Station, Namsangol is a wonderful place to visit if you are hard pressed for time like I was. This is an inner city attraction I would love to revisit."
59,4.0,"This preserved traditional Korean village, complete with huts and common areas, is located in the middle of the world’s most technologically wired city. Tours are conducted in English several times per day. Check with the information hut just inside the traditional gate on the right side when you enter. The big bonus is that it is entirely free to enter.It is well worth doing the free guided tours as the guides are able to fully explain what each little nuance of the houses. Eg the difference between male and female quarters, what the significance is of the number of levels of stones that the house is on, what the shape of each house signifies etc etc.The centre also houses the time capsule which commemorated 600th yrs of Seoul in 1994, and is to be opened 400 yrs from then. The centre is open free of charge and is very much well worth a visit. It is easy to get to, being located near Chungmuro Metro station. If your time in Seoul is brief, then this is a must. I ceertainly found is fascinating, and I hope you will too."
60,3.0,"If you are heading to Namsan, very close by at Chungmuro Station, Exit 3 is a collection of restored traditional houses and pavilions. Step back in time to see how the people of the time lived. Best of all, it's free! Note, it is closed on Tuesday."
61,3.0,"After visiting Gyeongbokgung, I decided to visit Namsangol Hanok Village as it was not too far away. Though just a couple of homes that was move from its original location to Namsan to be kept as a cultural heritage, it does give you a sense and feel of how someone's home and lifestyle is like during the late Joseon dynasty.Would have love to see them make actual use of some of the rooms, as part of the showcase."
62,5.0,"I had visited the village last autumn, and was surprised to see the scenery has changed with spring with all the cherry blossoms.  If short for time , do drop  by and see a fraction of Korean life in the past at Namsangol hanok Village , it is also just a stones throw away from Korea House next door."
63,5.0,"This ""Seoul Namsan Traditional Theater"" is located in Namsangol Hanok Village.  First building when you enter the gate.  There are theries of different type of tradiotional custumes for you to pick.  You wear it over what you are wearing so I recommend not to wear turtle neck shirts.  After you dressed, walk to outside and decide where you like for them to take pics.  They will provide this pic before you leave.  And Korean Traditional Tea Ceremony, the instructor speaks Korean but there will be English, Japanese or Chinese Translater during the session to assist.  It's worth experience.  I truely enjoyed it!  Then, after that you can enjoy traditional live music at the site.  Well organanized and wonderful experience."
64,4.0,"I just went a few days ago to the Hanok Village. The place itself is very nice and quiet, its bitter cold outside, however, and it shows because theres barely any people visiting. The place is definitely worth a visit."
65,5.0,"I just LOVED this place!  It is a faithful recreation of the traditional Korean Hanok houses from the Joseon dynasty.  Entry is free; and if you get there early, you can secure a place on the free guided tour with an English-speaking guide.  Some of the houses are actual houses which have been restored; others are recreations of the Hanok homes.  It's a wonderful place to wander around and enjoy the gardens, pond, and general atmosphere.  There are spotlessly clean rest rooms, and plenty of places to enjoy a picnic.  You can also see the time capsule, which was created to celebrate Seoul's 600th anniversary, and will be opened at the 1000th anniversary in 2394.  Allow at least half a day to truly enjoy your time at the Namsangol Hanok Village."
66,4.0,"It's agreable to take a stroll in Namsangol Hanok village. The buildings are well decorated to let us know how korean people used to live. There are also lots of activities to discover korean traditional culture : you can create masks, you can try wearing a hanbok... There are a  lot of tourists, but also some korean families with their children."
67,4.0,"I enjoyed my short visit to the Village. Pressed for time, the walk form the Chungmuro station was a breeze. As the autumn leaves are as colorful , I am sure the place is a major spot come Cherry Blossoms season.  The place is so compact , it's practically easy to cover the whole place in an hour . Would love to go back to exlplore the buildings and the interesting activities that goes inside."
68,4.0,"This area is free and is an easy walk. Finding a place like this in the middle of a modern city is a trip. while there is no mistake this area has been set up for tourist the architecture against the backdrop of the tall buildings makes for a nice visit. Also, they have performances on certain days and you may watch people hand make sandals."
69,3.0,"I went for a traditional performance and loved it.  It doesn't matter if you don't speak the language because the physical comedy in traditional performances are very pronounced.  The grounds were pretty, but by the time I got to the traditional home, I was a little tired of looking at them."
