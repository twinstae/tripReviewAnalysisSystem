8,4.0,Interesting place if you're looking for cosmetics. Go for the street food as the restaurants here serve Korean food that's below par with a higher price.  It's hard to bargain even with the stalls and mom-pop kind of retail outlets as I have the impression that they have fixed the prices.
9,4.0,This street is simply a good visit. There are all kinds of shops from stalls to big departmental stores and prices vary accordingly. It has great street food especially at night and it’s a good place to interact with everyday Koreans. It’s worth a visit

We then proceeded to shop for unique Korean snacks, Maxim coffee, chocopie, all kinds of face masks, as pasalubong.We also tried the streetfood of sausage&tekkbokki, fish cake on a stick. We were too full to try the rocket potato and seafood. We also shopped at Innisfree. There are a lot of make-up stores here.

21,4.0,"Myeongdong is a haven for Korean beauty products. The atmosphere was buzzing in this area. I only visited in the night time and there was an array of street food. One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular. For example, I was looking for COSRX products which I found only to be available in certain branches of Olive Young."
22,4.0,A place to buy the lastest and most trendiest lines of cosmetic product. Great place to buy cosmetics souvenir for your love ones.

24,5.0,"So for sometime now I have been using various Korean beauty products. Needless to say when I finally booked my holiday to South Korea, I immediately did my research where to buy beauty products. The place to head to is Myeongdong district which contains a grid of streets brimming with shops selling beauty products. Seriously, I was in heaven. I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.Also, when you buy stuff from these shops most of them give you freebies ... I loved it.  A must visit for anyone who is a beauty junkie like me."
25,5.0,"Looking to stock up on beauty products, creams and everything you will ever need, this is the street to go.. They do deals for tourists like buy 10 get 10 free plus if you take your passport with you they will give you the vat back on it. You dont need to take your passport but it saves the lines once you get to the airport to claim your vat back"
26,5.0,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight."
27,5.0,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market.  This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items.If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won.Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes.  From famous fashion brands to ordinary types.  The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia.If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food."
28,4.0,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time."

32,5.0,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11.  I'd definitely cone back again."
33,5.0,"Skincare,  cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks,  souvenirs,  cute things and a whole lot more."
34,4.0,The shopping street is a series of closed off roads where vendors sell local foods in the evening. Cosmetic shops and local grocery stores proliferate. Not sure if too many bargains can be found but it is a fun night out. Of course the obligatory massage places are also everywhere.
35,4.0,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers especially the night ones! Unique experience and not that known... its a great surprise while getting informed about the sight seeing of this wonderful city
36,5.0,"Unless you visit at 10am between Mon-Thurs expect it to be a mad house. It’s always jam packed with people. As as westerner it has some of the best options for shopping in my opinion as it offers more stores and sizes that I’m familiar with. Also it has all the major local stores if interested in those. The street food is second to none in Korea! I would recommend everyone go at least twice, first time time to experience the crowds so when you return again you’re have an idea of what to expect and will be able to enjoy it a bit more."
37,4.0,"Lunchtime mid week, it’s hot and humid. The fans are buzzing and there are people all over the place.The street has shops and it’s buzzing. I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching. I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi. A great place to wonder around."
38,5.0,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos."
39,5.0,"If you enjoy shopping, this is a place you needto be. The famous korean face masks of varied kinds are available in the various stores on huge discounts. And the variety of food that you can eat while u shop.. its a jaw dropping experience"
40,5.0,"There's all your usual shops down here from JD sports to Nike to cosmetic shops. Additionally there are tonnes of good eateries including my personal favourite BBQ joint in town. There will be tonnes of people, but it's not like it's tourists, it's 95 percent locals. Bring comfy walking shoes and water as the SK humidity is no joke and there's several hills in the area. There are good food places legit at every corner so just take some time to explore."
41,5.0,"I haven't been back to korea since I moved to United States 40 years ago. I was so looking forward to the visit and ir didn't disappoint. Myeongdong street was one of the places I visited and it was one of the best places I visited, second only to namdaemon market. Picked up a few gifts for friends back at the state. Anyway it was very pleasant experience."
42,1.0,I expected much more from this place. It was basically streets of lots of facial stuff and nothing much more. The clothing and other stuff like electronics are sooo limited. Was a disappointment for me
43,3.0,"This was a great area to shop. But as I went down many different streets, I saw the same shops. Stores like H&M that are anywhere, and local stores over and over. How many do you need in one area? Still, it has a nice feel if you just want to shop. I was looking for something specific and became overwhelmed by street after street of the same thing."
44,5.0,"Visited around 4pm on Saturday.  Absolutely nuts - stalls everywhere, shoppers everywhere, food carts serving huge variety of street food. Just amazing to wander through the chaos and take in the scenes. Lots of cheap goods if you are looking for souvenirs from Seoul.  Plan for at least an hour to wander, more if you want to eat."
45,4.0,"As my hotel is in Myeongdong, I walked past this area regularly. There are the usual malls, shops and restaurants. As expected in Korea, there are many cosmetic and accessories shops targeting the ladies. Not to miss are the food streets. Suggest you visit in the evening to experience the atmosphere and buzz here."
46,4.0,Many stalls set up on this pedestrian street food zone that is actually a UNESCO site. They serve just about everything on a stick including the tornado potato which originated here. It's crazy crowded and crazy fun for awhile until the tummy is full anyway. I am not into the shopping however and blew that whole thing off. Many high end stores have made shopping one of the main tourist attractions here.
47,4.0,"This is the main shopping area in Seoul. If you want to get away from the high end pricey department stores, then you can come here. There are the brand shops but there are cheap stuff to buy as well."
48,5.0,"A must visit place if you are planning to come to Seoul. Lot of choices of items from fashion, cosmetics, foods, Coffee shops and familiar brand like The North Face, Uniqlo, Daiso and very close to Myeongdong station. Plenty of guesthouse around and also close to Seoul Tower and Seoul Station. Friendly for english speaking travellers."
49,3.0,I was a bit disappointed in this area - there are heaps of shops around but for some reason this area didn't do much for me. There are some others with more atmosphere- Hondae for instance.
50,4.0,"My first day of Seoul, s Korea trip brought me from Incheon Airport to Seoul railway station. Next, after leaving my luggage at the hostel, I swiftly decided to see the Myeongdong shopping street! First impression, very long and lots of restaurants, clothing shops, and souvenir shops on there! Most well known brand such as Zara, HM, and Polo were all there, furthermore, I found Miniso the Japanese and Chinese bargain shop there too! Very nice! Lots of BBQ restaurants there too!

52,5.0,"Shop till drop! Lot of street food, shops and here you will find huge crowd. There are information people placed at random places if you need guide. You can buy souvenirs here which is cheaper.  There are lot of junctions here and make sure u remember your source junction, you can be a bit confused."
53,4.0,"I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls. It was primarily pedestrian access (but make no mistake, watch out for small trucks and motorcycles) and at times was very busy.Lots of food vendors of all types of street foods and most were very cheap. I had shrimp, crabs, and strawberries and all were good. The stores were more conventional brand names and there were a lot of them. It seemed popular for the younger crowd.When i went there were numerous tourism representatives eager to help. My overall impression was that it was very safe and friendly. Great place to try the street eats and maybe scope out a bargain."

There are also ""samples"" in almost every store so do not hesitate asking for it in exchange for a quick visit inside their shop. There are also restaurants, shoe stores, malls, and STREET FOODS! A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit to Myeongdong."

Uniqlo, Zara, Guess, H&M and Forever 21 are also in the area. There are also 2 huge Daiso’s...3 floors! I also fell in love with Artbox. I also had the most amazing pancake with honey from one of the food vendors! The shopping street is accessible by the Myeongdong station."

74,1.0,"Tacky, overpriced and overcrowded. It doesn’t seem to be too much different from any shopping thoroughfare anywhere else in the world - it could be Tokyo, New York, London or Beijing, were it not for the korean lettering everywhere. Unless you have a particular desire to spend too much on substandard fare, avoid."
75,3.0,"Area is huge. Alleys Cross to each other packed with clothes, food, jewellers etc. This place is kind of must to see f you haven't visit an any other Asia countries outdoor market.

79,5.0,"This place has got to be ladies’ favourite place of whole Seoul. You can find lots of beauty products here. I personally LOVE Olive Young store where you can find numerous products for skincare and cosmetics. I basically went into every shops in Myeongdong. The street vendors selling street foods are the best. Do try the fishcake with soup, Hotteok, fried squids, Jeok (savoury pancake). But in winter it can be a little difficult to shop. But that did not stop me from dropping by there every day. Will definitely go there again.P/s: for the ladies who want to buy beauty products, pls do your homework and plan what you want to buy. Because everything in Korean and you must know what you want to buy."
80,3.0,I had heard a lot about the shopping here but i was not very satisfied with the experience.  It was crowded and your pace will be dictated by the oldest and slowest in the crowds. The merchandise on sale mostly appeated to be generic knock-offs and no-name fabrics. The bargaining was half-hearted at best. The other less popular markets and shopping streets are better so i'd skip this one if you are on a limited timetable or looking for something specific.
81,5.0,"While there are plenty of places to shop up and down the street, I came here for the food, and I was not disappointed! Even on a cold night (-10C), there were plenty of people lining the streets trying out all the street food vendors. I did a walk to scout out the place first and selected a few places here and there to try out, and wasn't disappointed in any of them. They even had an Oreo Churro cart that I skipped out on, but the hot food really hit the spot on a cold night. Don't know much Korean but was able to communicate with finger pointing and numbers in English (or calculators), which got the job done. Would definitely come back to this place, maybe next time not in the winter though. =D"
82,5.0,Amazing world full of small wendors who are offering great street food. Get lost inside this beautiful place and try all the food!
83,5.0,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street, and all the associated side streets and lane-ways, is a great way to spend at LEAST a couple of hours just walking around this primarily pedestrian shopping area. There is so much to see, well-know (and not so well-known) shops to browse, and a plethora of restaurants, and street food vendors. I just love to sample street food wherever I visit, and I just loved being able to sample some of the very tasty and generally inexpensive street food that was on offer in this shopping precinct.While it is referred to as a shopping street (implying that it is a single street..) it is actually an entire area of primarily pedestrian streets that all seem to ""hang off"" what is generally accepted as the main ""shopping street"".A visit to Seoul is definitely not complete unless you have spent at least a couple of hours wandering around this area. Fortunately for my partner and I, our hotel was only about 10-12 minutes walk away, and so we passed through this area on a number of occasions, and enjoyed the experience every time... daytime OR night-time. Thoroughly recommended."
84,5.0,I love this shopping district in Seoul where all items you want are available from high end items to mid range goods and products and street foods. Stay at this area for your unlimited exploration of this area. I love Myeongdong very much because of the many coffee shops here and restaurants offering Korean food and other international cuisines. This is a must see when you are in Seoul. Stay at Ibis Hotel Myeongdong because it is very near the area.
85,3.0,"Even though it's a long street, the shops are repeated so essentially it's just a really short stretch of shops. Mostly beauty and make up products. Their main targets seem to be Chinese tourists, and they sell things in bulk (e.g. 80 face mask sheets). Some decent street food."
86,5.0,"Place full of cosmetic products. Every corner, the same brand, street food is all around. Great to walk around even one is not buying."
87,4.0,"Myeongdong is actually a district or a series of streets rather than only one. It attracts residents and visitors because of the shops, upscale department stores, restaurants, amazing street-food carts at night, underground malls and more. I recently stayed for 10 days at a hotel in the area and really enjoyed the location because of the activity.The district has two main streets, one that starts at the Myeongdong subway station and the other at Lotte Department Store by the Euljiro 1 subway stop, exit 6. Though shops offer everything from clothing to jewelry, Korean cosmetics and beauty creams seem to predominate with hawkers sometimes standing outside, offering free samples to entice passersby to enter. Side streets seem to go every which way, so it is easy to get lost. When that happened to me, I would look for two people in red uniforms. These signify men and women available to answer questions and give directions. At least one member of the pair speaks English. There are also tourist information offices around, where employees speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.When night falls, neon signs brighten the streets and food carts appear. Crowds descend on the area and walking almost comes to a standstill. Food items for sale include noodles, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, kimchi pancakes, lobster, dumplings and the list goes on.  Hundreds of people stand there and eat in the street. For those not into shopping, consider coming here at night to sample the food."
88,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is fun, lively and bursting with energy. There are all kinds of shops, department stores and restaurants. There is also a great variety of street food. Several of the local cosmetic shops offer a free sample face mask if you come into the store and browse. There are free concerts sometimes. I happened to see two very different but good concerts on two separate occasions."
89,4.0,"Who will miss this place? Lots of street foods, cosmetics and clothes.  Not forgetting, there are cafes and is right above the subway!"
90,5.0,"Cosmetic Heaven. This is the phrase to describe it. You will be spoilt with plenty of cosmetic products such as facial cream, facial masks and so on. There are lots of promoters offering discounts on their products. At the end of the day, it is more of a question of preference and good bargain that will influence your spending. There are also lots of other shops around such as fashion boutiques, sports boutiques such as Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc. Overall, the place to be when you are in Seoul."
91,5.0,"Myeongdong is one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism districts – so as you walk around, you’ll see many makeup stores, clothing stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.As night begins to draw closer, people will begin setting up food stalls, so I highly recommend you stay to experience the food (I had my first Korean sweet potato at one of these food stalls! GOOD LORDY LORD WAS IT EVER DELICIOUS!)."
92,5.0,"A few tourist attractions are easily accessible from  Myeongdong. There’s also the  convenience of the subway and the airport bus. If you are into K-beauty, this is the place to shop for beauty products.  There’s the Night market, plenty of street food, restaurants and cafes’ and shops.Lotte and Shinsegae are two major shopping / dept stores. The food court at Lotte is great!"

99,4.0,"There are lots of stores, clothes, cosmetics, shoes, but the real appeal is the food carts.Ranging from cheap ddobbki to real lobster tails there is something for every price range and food preference. Dont like street food, there are plenty of restaurants from K-bbq to McDonalds"
100,4.0,"This shopping area is quite big but definitely can be covered within a couple of hours. There are many restaurants throughout but they are more hidden within alleys or up the stairwells. There are many repeats of the same stores over and over again, so I’m not too sure if it’s necessary to cover the whole area for some. At about 5-6pm, food stall vendor will line the Main Street. The food is excellent and there’s a huge variety, but it is slightly overpriced for certain items."
101,3.0,"Unless you are into shopping, this is just another average shopping place so many locations around Seoul."
102,5.0,"Myeongdong shopping street is probably the most famous amongst tourist.Very lively in the evening and nights. Most of the shops close by 11pm.Loads of beauty product shops. Do your research before buying any of the face mask. Like brand, your skin, which mask will suit you. Pricing in different shops, sale discount etc. Another place to get a good bargain for the beauty products is lotte shopping centre which is another area.Myeongdong shopping has got some good street food so definitely try them."
103,4.0,"It has a lot of cosmetic shops, you get free cosmetic samples and a lot of eateries/ street food. A must visit for street food lovers/ street shoppers. Also currency exchange rates are good here."
104,5.0,If your main hobby is shopping then this is a heaven for you! A lot of things to buy and see.. street food is also everywhere..
105,5.0,This was a great place for night market for food. There was a huge array of shops there too. I ate there a few nights. I especially enjoyed the gimbap. I think South Korean sushi is lovely.
106,5.0,"You can get everything you need here : clothes, make up, accessories, get some yummy street food or go to a restaurant. Always crowded, noisy, but fun :) Always kpop music playing out loud for the mood too. Great place to hang out."
107,4.0,"Like many commercial street in Seoul, Myeongdong has the same structres. It's okay to go there for eating street food and buying something. I love the Church here. It's a nice Church where you should travel at least once time in your life. The picture is at the end of Myeongdong."
108,5.0,i went with a tour guide (hyeyoung Seo ) who gave me an insight to the korean tradition history and culture ....she was verrrrry well informed ...loved this street and went back to it a day later ...i would say you can spend an hour before you head to insadong ...
109,5.0,"Day and night this place is full of people, stalls of food, clothes and heaps of other stuff to buy and try...Anthony.D"
110,5.0,"It's obvious that it's going to be crowded all the time but the vibe and atmosphere of the nightlife is fabulous. There's delicious street food, shops, and cosmetics galore as well as plenty of restaurants if you'd rather sit down and enjoy a meal. Highly recommend visiting Myeongdong when in Seoul."
111,5.0,You'll find most of the beauty product and souvenirs here. Great street food easy to get to. A simple train ride or bus can get you here easily.
112,5.0,The steet food was the best part! There are a great deal of shops but most are the same as you would see anywhere else. The street food however was fantastic. I tried several different things and it was a great experience.
113,5.0,"This place is RIDICULOUS - so many shops, especially skincare and beauty, plus loads of cute stores like Line Friends and ARTBOX. I saved up my shopping for the last day! There are loads of little side streets and turns you can take and it would be easy to get lost but it’s shaped like a grid so it’s actually not that difficult to find your way back to where you start, only problem is there are multiple sites for shops, like there’s about 3 branches of Tony Moly within the same area so don’t use a brand like that as your signpost! I recommend getting cake at Billy Angel while you’re there..."
114,4.0,"Once getting out of the station, therr will be scene of shops lining up the streets. Each shop would play different playlist - some would sound familiar, some would not. This place is best for buying beauty care (there are too many brands to mention, but I would like to recommend nature republic which is next to station exit). In case you need new clothes, go buy one at either Uniqlo (the biggest branch store in Asia) or a shopping mall next to nature republic. The shopping mall has 3-4 floors: men's clothing on first floor, women's on second floor. There are gorgeous clothings to find in there though some might be in low quality (I am saying this because the one I bought was not sewed tight enough. It might be damaged if I am not careful enough). About the food hawkers, the price might vary depends on what you eat and in which hawkers you buy. Take an example... One gyeranppang (Korean egg bun) costs 2000 won while roasted lobster tail with melted cheese costs you 15.000 won (I actually doubt the price... Was not it too expensive? I need to cross check about it)"
115,3.0,I found this area boring. It might as well be Tokyo or Paris. Same brands everywhere. The only thing which is different is that there is a lot of cosmetic shops. Since I don’t use that I found the area boring. Many other things to do instead.
116,4.0,Shops and street foods galore. Don’t have your meal before you come here. Stuff yourself with the delicious street food that fill this place. Clothes are cheap as well.
117,5.0,Just wow. You could get lost easily as streets after streets are shops of all kinds. There's plenty of food to try as well.
118,5.0,"I am a huge fan of korean cosmetics and skincare. This place is heaven for shoppers because it has all the important shops in the same place, sometimes even 2/3 shops from the same brand in one street. And they give lots of free samples. In Myeongdong you can also find an underground shopping center with lots of clothes and not expensive at all. A must do in Korea"
119,3.0,Walked arouns for several hours and took in the street food scene. The street food was much better than the shopping as the was an abundance of cosmetic stores.
120,5.0,Very fun place to walk around and look at the street food. I wasn't brave enough to have a taste of any of it though. If you are visiting Seoul you have to visit Myengdong.
121,5.0,"Loved every bit of it..Lotte young plaza and lotte plaza are 2 of the bigger malls in this area. But you do get multiple other malls as well.You must visit the underground shopping center which is situated near the lotte young plazaIn the evening the area bursts into life with action stations of delicious street food. Craving for some of it right now!Shops are open till 10pm but the larger 2 malls close a bit earlier than that.Ooh and if you are a k-pop fan.. loads of merchandise!! Including pop up stores..I stayed at the sotetsu hotel, the splasir myeong-dong. Which was nice and cozy. However, there are many hotels around that area that you can try out as wellOverall.. a must visit. Im definitely visiting again!"
122,4.0,"Myeongdong is definitely crowded as it is a tourist area. You can find just about anything you'd want to buy here from cosmetics to food. The price of the street food can add up, so don't plan on having street food for dinner unless you don't mind the cost! You can get great reals if you know how to pick your shops or if you know how to haggle with the vendors. Definitely a nice place to visit in Seoul!"
123,4.0,"It is easy to get to Myeong-dong by subway, there is a station right there. The streets are buzzing and you can buy just about anything!"
124,3.0,"despite only staying 10 minute walk away from myeongdong I only seemed to be brave and go about twice during my whole 3 month long trip as i couldn't stand the constant crowds of people at all times myeongdong just seemed to be constantly busy. there never seems to be a quiet hour or quiet street. however, the shop are amazing and the amount of free samples i got just walking up and down the street was amazing i didn't even have to go in!"
125,4.0,"I felt a bit overwhelmed at the start.but its got everything here.definitely worth a visit, especially if you want to get skincare products"

130,4.0,"A great place to visit, the shopping is amazing, plenty of street food to try. Recommend the chicken skewers. Movies here go in morning, only 8000 won. Got some new glasses here, ready in one day, 1/3cost of glasses in NZ. Well worth a couple of visits. Open till early morning."
131,5.0,My favorite neighborhood during my Seoul’s visit. Lots of street food places to try Korean food. Good place to come to on your first day in Seoul.
132,5.0,"I'll be honest, I'm not usually a ""shopper"" on vacation but I think this street converted me. It's a haven for anything and everything you could imagine - seriously, anything you're looking for at any price range, this place has got it! I personally found myself more drawn to stationary/home goods/Korean skincare stores. Even in the intense rain that was happening during my visit, this place was a pleasure to visit. Also, if you don't try the street-food (there is a street dedicate to this) you're missing out on one of the best experiences Seoul will give you. I tried out some tteokbokki, kimbap and found an organic milk based soft serve stand and they were all heavenly."
133,5.0,"There is a lot of shops that offers variety things like korean cosmetics , Albums, Shoes, Clothes & many more . There is a lot of cafes & restaurants. Don't forget korean street food at night too! Shopping heaven in Seoul"
134,2.0,"Lots of shop with cosmetics, souvenirs, Korean BBQs, etc. Very lively with thousands of Japanese and Chinese tourists. Personally quite disappointed by the place and overall not really interesting. On top of that, expensive prices."
135,5.0,"Budget street shopping galore, bring cash for the food stalls. Staff are always very friendly, and you can get free things like facemarks and hand mirrors just for being a foreigner."
136,4.0,"About a 20min walk from Seoul train station or 2 subway stops.  Bring good walking shoes.  Lots of shops, restaurants, things to see."
137,5.0,"If you are looking for cosmetics, trendy clothes at a bargain price, this is the place to be. There are also the latest gimmick items and shoes, t-shirt shops, etc.  Oh, and the street food stands are abundant, selling variety of Korean finger foods at a very reasonable price. And, it gets very crowded at night."
138,5.0,"Really fun to pop into the stores in this area. There are also sometimes street vendors selling food or t-shirts and colourful socks that make great souvenirs. There are also a lot of of K Beauty shops in this area, so stock up on your face masks! Try not to get lost while you are having fun shopping!"
139,4.0,"It was Sunday when i went to this street to look for souvenir for my family and friends after i found out that Dongdaemun Market closed on Sunday.Very crowded place with tourists and locals. The food were amazing to look but if you not into Korean taste, i won't recommend you to buy or eat it. The taste might disappoint you. I love food! Love to cook too. So it was not as i expected to taste and i waste money on it. But if you just don't care about money then go ahead and buy the food streets."
140,4.0,"Came here specifically to look for cheap glasses, which I did not get, but it is a lively area to eat some street food and do some shopping. Before you start, get to an information office, there is one near Boots on the main street, and get a Myeongdong guide map of the area. Apart from the streets it tells you where different types of shops are, restaurants, toilets etc. They also have a Seoul Official Tourist Map, which I had not seen before, which has  street maps of different tourist areas, very useful. Try and get it elsewhere at the start of your holiday if you can."
141,4.0,"This is by far the most amazing in place for shopping and window shopping skincare and beauty products.You can get there by metro and get off in the Station with the same name.You can also find restaurants and bars to go during, after or before shopping.Locals are crazy for this type of products, foreigners have a difficult time to decide whether to spend all their money thereOr not.Such a wonderful experience for men (set up a business) and women (makeup and skincare products). U can’t miss it"
142,4.0,Great place to shop for facial masks! Lots of shops. Street stalls start to set up for business in the evening.
143,5.0,"so many cosmetics store (mostly korean brand), like innisfree, etude house, nature republic, holikaholika, tonymoly, and many more, and every brand has more than 1 store so if you found that the product is sold out in one store, you can try to find it in another store. overall the beauty advisors are helpful, esp in Lush store, they spoke english fluently.In myeongdong u can find not only cosmetics, but also restaurants and street food. the street is clean and at the most of time is crowded, especially at night"
144,4.0,"True, there is nothing that sets this shopping street apart from any other in Asia, but I had nice strolls at different times of day. The street food was tasty, I felt safe, and enjoyed watching the people. I treated myself to some Korean lipstick as cosmetics are all the rage. You can find almost anything there and in every price point all around this area."
145,4.0,I love this place it was so lively. with ppl and it had every thing you can ever ask for in a place like this. food is great. shops has a lot variety. a really pleasant place
146,5.0,"Famously known for good shopping, all the good brands are here, along with smaller market stalls and unique places like gun ranges or cat cafes to keep you entertained. Be cautious when on your own, I had a man approach me asking for ""donations"" for a hospital he worked at, and when I said no, he and someone sitting next to me got up and walked away together. Otherwise good food, a LOT of skincare and massage places, and a nice vibe. The Namba theatre is also here which I would 100% recommend going to if you're in the area."
147,4.0,"Myeong dong is where you could get all the K-beauty products, then after tired of shopping, around 5 pm all the street food and some clothes vendors will start lining  up on the main street. Nice to see all is happening in one place! The shop staff could be quite pushy offering free mask to get you to their store and buy stuff. Some of food vendors not happy if you just take pictures without buying."
148,4.0,"Myeongdong shopping centre is convenient to access, because it's close to the station, korean makeup and skincare are everywhere."
149,3.0,Many shops located in a maze of streets and side streets. Lots of outdoor food stalls. A wide selection of stores and eating places
150,5.0,Visited the shopping street where myriads of cosmetic items and fashion trend wear are available. My only challenge is the non English speaking sales people and the description of items only in Korean.
151,1.0,"I was travelling in Seoul the first time and  had the worst shopping experience I've ever had so far. I was shopping clothes in one of stores and there were some problems I was trying to ask the lady behind the counter. She got impatient and annoyed at me very quick because she couldn't understand English well. The harder I tried to explain the angrier she became. She eventually told me to get lost of her shop as she can't be brother to deal with me. I was shocked and humiliated. I've never been treated like that. I don't think I want to go to the place anymore. If you'd like to shop, try somewhere else besides myeobgdong. They don't care about customer service cuz they all know you as a tourist won't be a return customer anyway."
152,4.0,This is a great place to walk for shopping.  Make sure and find the area with the street foods.  You can get a great lobster sandwich made fresh for you right there in the street there.   Best street food I’ve ever had
153,5.0,Shop till you drop! And also the street food is beyond-delicious and not expensive at all! Amazing just amazing ...
154,5.0,"If you like to buy Korea cosmetic, you can go here. If you are fans of ft island, cnblue, AOA and the others artist of FNC, you can go to the fnc wow, they sell cake and latte and others."
155,4.0,must visit place for shopping especially cosmetics. cheap and so many discount here! bring your own bag here for shopping! for the streetfood i dont recommend this place cause its expensive and the taste just so so.
156,3.0,"A bit touristy but you must experience it at least once. Beauty products, food an people everywhere! Shopper's paradise"
157,5.0,The best place where you can find all what you are looking for... starting from Korean beauty products to street food & clothes. I was lucky to have this market just on the other side of my hotel ‘Lotte Seoul’
158,5.0,"The busiest market in Seoul (comparing to Insadong, Gwangjang, Itaewon, Namdaemun). Visited this market several times during my five days in Seoul. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best place for make-up hunter, and popular brand products. Will be better to visit at night when the light envelopes the crowd. Very recommended."
159,5.0,It is good to buy cosmetics from here. There are many popular brands and many choices of seller who offer discounts. The food is killer too. Would be here sometimes again
160,4.0,It is a shopping paradise for shopaholics. However the streets food here are not cheap though. And basically you will keep passing by salesperson from the stall trying to you into their store by giving you freebies. Do not go in if you are not interested of the products and do not be enticed by the freebies. Cause they will only give you the freebies after you have bought something from the store. And the salesperson attitude will change 180 degree if you do not buy anything from them after entering.
161,4.0,"there's many of the same cosmetic shops in all over myeongdong. Some of the quieter ones don't got salesperson outside waving freebies - so you might wander a bit further to another outlet of the brand u are looking for. There isn't much shopping for clothes to do here, and some of the eateries vicinity feel more of Chinese-ish than korean-ish. So if you are looking for authentic Korean food, choose wisely."
162,4.0,"This places offers a lot and can be a one stop place if you like shopping for shoes and skin care products. At night, a lot of stalls come around, but their food is expensive! $3-$6 is expensive for street food, but well... had to try what they have because I want to a gastronomic adventure. If you are in a group, I suggest you go to restos around this area because their food is better abd you can comfortably sit and put your food on the table.There are also a lot of other shops for shoes, clothes and beauty shops here and there. Overall, this place is definitely a must visit. It's also near Namdaemun Market if you want to go. It's also packed with tourists btw and when the weather is cold, come to this place because there's a lot of people = heat. lol"
163,4.0,"Although it's a bit touristic but it's a good place for Korean street food and nice place for shopping too. You can get your best deal on cosmetic, fashion and phone accessories here. There's also many restaurants and bars."
164,3.0,"Spread over huge area. Mostly cosmetics, clothes , pharmacies and accessories stores. Starts by 10:30 am and open till 10 pm."
165,5.0,"Wild and crazy. Tons of lights, people, food, bars, action and SHOPPING! So much to do and see. It's packed with K-beauty products everywhere you turn. Much better at night than the day time."
166,5.0,"If you want do do some shopping and eat, this is place to go.You will find many of them, and you can spend hours there.The best thing is the street food (see my pictures). You MUST try it."
167,5.0,"If you came to visit Seoul for the shopping, this is a must-see area for you. Shop til you drop and enjoy all the delicious street foods as well. Plenty of restaurants, souvenirs, and prime shopping stores that line the streets here. Glad there were a few Starbucks here since it was cold out and had a much needed coffee break to warm up. The Starbucks was 3 stories I believe so plenty of space to kick back and connect to wi-fi for a bit. While there are definitely some gents shopping available, the VAST majority of shopping you will find in Seoul will be women's fashion and cosmetics. In any case, the food is cheap, but be sure to bring a few extra bucks to spend so you don't miss out."
168,5.0,"I love Korean cosmetics, thats why I went to seoul to buy at Myeongdong. All skin care products are there, they also go on sale almost 50% off so prepare your wallets and credit cards. And dont forget the street foods, try everything! Everything is yummy!!!"
169,2.0,"If you are into asian food, this street will be your heaven, if you are not a huge fan like me, then not really recommend. Crowded street with lots of street food carts"
170,5.0,Even if you don't shop you should go check out the cool stores and street food. If you are shopping it has everything you need!
171,5.0,I loved going around this street because there are lots of different band cloths and lots of street foods too for those who love trying street food like me 😁Also you can get free face pack...who would refuse if it's for free 😂
172,4.0,Walked around this area a few nights in a row to pick up street food/go to dinner/look at shops/people watch. Lots going on. Plenty of shopping if you're into that. Great subway access.
173,4.0,"I was staying in the area, so I walked through at many times through the day. There are many places to shop, get a coffee or get a bite to eat. It’s also very convenient to the subway, so it’s easy to get to from anywhere in the city.I am not much of a shopper, but there are tons of places to buy face creams and the like. I was more interested in the street food, which is varied, plentiful and open late!"
174,5.0,Myeongdong is not my favorite. It is too crowded..  But it offers you so many foods you can try..  😬 their pop up store is a thing
175,3.0,"Myeongdong shopping area is huge. With a large concentration of shops, first time visitors can be easily overwhelmed. The streets can start to look similar and getting lost is easy. First time visitors should not try to do everything in one day. Have a shopping list and address and picture of shops you want to visit, it will easy to ask for information with those. Address if possible should be in both English and Korean.The place really become alive in the evening as food vendors start setting up food carts along side permanent stalls. Do beware of eating from these food vendors as you are still trying to get use to the food as a tourist. Overall Myeongdong shopping area can be enjoyable if you come with an open mind and try out the different food and shopping experience."
176,3.0,"The land of cosmetic shops, fashion brands clothes and cute stuff. The street food here is also interesting and tasty."
177,5.0,"Great place for cosmetics - more often that not, products in stores at Myeongdong are buy one get one free - so make sure you ask if that's the case with what you are buying. It never hurts to ask for a little extra discount - sometimes, you can get up to 18% just for asking!"
178,4.0,it is just a shopping street... like others. and you can hear people screaming Chinese to attract Chinese customers.
179,5.0,This place is definitely one which you must go to when in Seoul. Shopping and eatng street food are the best activities here. There are a ton of skin care brands and products sold here 😁
180,5.0,"I appreciate the attention-to-detail the class offers for foreigners and feel that for newcomers to Korea that are interested in cooking, this is one class that you should consider for getting to know Chris, Korea, and of course cooking with Korean ingredients."
181,4.0,Great shopping area! Very expensive though! Many stores have multiple shops throughout. Great restaurants and street food. Very festive atmosphere.
182,5.0,Perfect place for shoppers who loved cosmetics products! They sell it much more cheaper than in my own country (Malaysia). There’s a total of 400 pieces of mask I bought! 😛😛😛
183,5.0,"Rows upon rows of Korean cosmetics shops. Plenty of clothes shops too. You can shop your heart out here and when you go hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants nearby. At night there are food carts which add to the lively vibe of this district. When shopping for cosmetics, do compare prices even between the same brands. Most brands have multiple branches in this district and some are even opposite each other. Some branches have deeper discounts than the others so look around before purchasing anything."
184,4.0,"I don’t have the shopping gene. My hotel in Seoul is in the heart of Myeongdong though, so I thought, when in Rome. Aside from the big name stores, a lot of street stalls popped up, as the sun went down, selling some delicous street food and lots of cheap gloves, coats, bags and the like. The area also has lots of phone covers, K-Pop swap cards and gifts to take home that are sometimes required when you’ve taken a holiday. You should be able to kit out the relatives and friends, co-workers etc. here while also buying some quality stuff from the Doc Marten or Adidas or other named brand shops. If you must go shopping this is a pretty painless place to do it."
185,3.0,"The entire street is packed with the bigger Korean brands that makes it very easy to grab souvenirs for friends back home. A lot of service staff here are Chinese, so language-wise, apart from Korean this is an alternative. Very crowded and touristy though, don't expect to come here to experience the ""real"" Seoul!"
186,5.0,"When you visit seoul, this is the another place, you must visit. It is like siam square in Bangkok. But at night there are heap of food stalls along the street. You can grab any foods, snacks as you like. There are some good restaurants and Bar for groups of people. A good time to visit is from 17.30-21.00pm."

190,5.0,"For those who are into shopping, Myeongdong is perfect for you! From cosmetics and make up to garments and apparels, you can get it in Myeongdong. The prices are from cheap to okay, but you can haggle, except maybe on cosmetics and beauty boutiques, but they always go on sale. 😊 you can also find some tasty street foods around."
191,4.0,"Nice street to walk down and do some shopping. Some of the cafes and restaurants are pretty good and are good value. Check out the Myeongdong Koja. It's really good value/proportion noodles. Street food was also fun to try. I liked the deepfried fish cake covered sausage/cheese, etc. stall. Not much shopping for guys. Nice place for women and couples. Ther're some neat shops to check out though so I wasn't bored. Just don't expect to buy too much as a guy."
192,3.0,Lots of big department stores and small stores too! Most are selling beauty products which is not my thing. Great street food all around and had fun trying most of them too.
193,5.0,"I spent many nights in Myeongdong while I was visiting Seoul. They have tons of shops, food carts, and restaurants. It’s one of the busiest and most crazy places I’ve ever been and I loved it."
194,4.0,"This is where the tourist pulse in Seoul beats the hardest. And why not, it has everything. Walking distance to some of the city’s attractions like Deoksugung palace and Namsan Tower. It is replete with retail shopping, cosmetics, streetfood, and the latest in K-fashion and did I say market of Namdaemun? You can go underground shopping, do hotel bar hop and feast endlessly on Korean dishes whatever suits your budget."
195,4.0,lot of people .. kk nice sercvice and lot of shops . everything i can find from here . really good place for travelers . ♡
196,4.0,For both expensive and affordable (underground market) for shopping.  CDs/socks/memorabilia of your fave actors you'll find it here. Street food stalls open after 3pm/4pm.Too quiet in the morning.

198,4.0,"You can't visit Seoul without going to Myeongdong, which is a shopping haven especially for cosmetics and beauty products. Various brands have different outlets around the area, salesperson will be luring you in with promise of free samples and products, the area is loud and crowded and alive and I love it! The street foods are not too bad either."
199,3.0,"Just street food that you can find in other streets. I bought a pollution mask with a smiley face on it for 5,000 won. That's about it."
200,5.0,This area is incredible for shopping! There are so many facial beauty products available.  Rows and rows of shops.  The prices are affordable too!  Look ahead of time to see if you can get the foreign traveller discounts for some shops - it will save you some money...and save some room in your luggage when you’re packing for all the stuff you’ll buy!
201,5.0,"Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main streets meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Unlike Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores have branches here, including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices.A must see in Seoul."
202,4.0,This street comes alive at night. You can get all sorts of stuff. From souvenirs to high end clothing!! Best part of the street is the the delicious street food one can get here. And the milling crowd at night with its multicultural hues makes it worth the visit!
203,4.0,"My hotel was located about a 15 minute walk from Myeong-dong. It is one of the main shopping areas in Seoul. There are two main streets – one from Myeongdong metro station (line 4) and the other from Fuljiro which meet at the centre. The area is full of shops and restaurants, cafes and street food stalls.There are many shops selling cosmetics. This is the place to buy good quality cosmetics at reasonable prices. Branded designer goods are sold as well. I am always a bit wary of buying such goods at prices that are too good to be true.There is a big department store – Lotte Department store in this area. Prices for designer goods are more or less reasonable.Myeongdong also has a number of good restaurants. In addition, there are fast food restaurants as well as eating places serving Korean, Japanese and Western cuisines. Many restaurants in Myeongdong specialize in kalguksu (noodle soup). You will also find banks, theatre and beauty and hair salons."

For girls,make sure you have enough luggage capacity coz it’s where you can buy cheap but good quality cosmetic and lots of free samples!!!!!"
205,3.0,I LOVE SHOPPING and live in a big city in the uk but I could not cope with the amount of people and shops however I did find everything I needed. Also side note boots in Korea is so expensive £8 for something the costs me £1.50 at home lol
206,5.0,"If your looking for something, anything, you will probably find it here. Huge variety of clothes, souvenirs and pretty much everything. Be sure to go into some of the buildings for lots more stalls and shops. Found they don’t barter much, maybe 10-20% but prices reasonable anyway. Leave enough time to explore."
207,3.0,"If you like to see the crowd, this is the place.  Shops are thd same for every corner. You can try street food in the evening."
208,4.0,"My hotel was right here so the street food was most convenient.  It seemed to be the most touristy area and thus most expensive.  They seemed to have more touristy foods like the chicken skewers, meat balls, fried chicken pieces along with some of the more traditional things.  I think I liked the chicken skewers the most here.  Go elsewhere if you are looking for more traditional stuff or cheaper food."
209,4.0,"Myeongdong, where the night is always young. Somehow time stops as you troll the streets and lanes of beauty shops, fashion outlets and food carts. The bright lights, the food smell, the touters' chants, the hawkers' showmanship, the heavy human traffic - the experience is multi-sensory! Landmarks don't quite work here because there are dozens of the same beauty shops at every lane that the streets all look almost the same as you turn the corner. Worth visiting for the multi sensory experience but it doesn't mean the purchases (including the food) are gentle on the pockets."
210,5.0,Exciting street with many varied eating options of wonderful korean food.Market priced clothing. Great atmosphere
211,5.0,"Hundreds of shops mostly cosmetics and apparels! Lots of restaurants too so easy to grab food during your shopping. At night, there are street vendors that make the area livelier. Try those street foodS from skewers to local snacks and delicacies. Subway myeongdong station or euljiro 1."
212,5.0,"Shopping for beauty products? Well there are at least 5 from where I stand. And they all beckon. Snail cream, animal facial masks, you name it. Packed a dozen or so. And those socks. Just had to get them for my wife, daughter and granddaughter!"
213,5.0,"Definitely worth a stop if you are traveling to Seoul. I had delicious street food there and enjoyed just walking around and soaking in the ambiance, with many restaurants, shops, and bars to explore."
214,4.0,"From fashion items to kpop items to cosmetic products in the morning then, street foods by late afternoon 'til the evening, you better prepare your money to fly away."
215,4.0,"While I'm not into the shopping here, I do enjoy the street food vendors stationed at numerous locations throughout the area. You can find some great treats on sticks."
216,3.0,The whole area caters to tourists. Most salesgirls are able to speak chinese and some can be pretty aggressive. They have repetitive brands almost at every turn of the corner. The street food are relatively more pricey too because its a touristy place. The streets get so crowded that you often have human traffic jams.  I stay there so it gets quite frustrating on my way back to the hotel...
217,5.0,If you want street food at night this is the place to be. So much variety and choice.  Bustling with energy and atmosphere. Tons of cosmetic stores too for bargain buys. Gives a good sense of Seoul at night. It's much more subdued during the day.My favourite area in the city
218,4.0,"There are many tasty things to eat here, but I think the shopping is getting overpriced. You can find better deals inside of subway stations."
219,4.0,"Large shopping street with many different shops and goods, especially for clothes and cosmetics. Also there are quite many places to have something to eat. For people who have the taste of shopping in traditional way rather than shopping centers."
220,3.0,"Same food, gadgets and accessories, even shops are the same nearly every block. The food on the street aren't that cheap for what they are."
221,5.0,"This place just has a great atmosphere. There are so many restaurants, local stores, clothing stores, etc. This place is just great for shopping and have a good vibe. You would feel like walking in times square without the tall buildings though. You want to make sure you have gelato ice cream."
222,5.0,"This is the place where you want to shop for cosmetics or even clothes. Once you are here to have to hold yourself, or you are going to buy everything. They even have a street food stall from the corner until the other side of myeongdong. There are cheap sweater or coat between them. Try the famous Kyoja noodle while you are there. You would need your passport if you buy cosmetic more than 30000 won to get tax refund."
223,2.0,"Lots and lots of stores.  Lots and lots of the same stores. How many Innisfree shops can there be? People flock here for the average purchase. When I was there, food carts were set up down the main street. It was busy with all sorts of activity.  I tried several of the foods, but they were all ""fast food"" and not good food.Interesting to see."
224,5.0,"Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics! Very lively with a lot of street food vendors as well. Area is safe, easy to navigate. A lot of clothes store as well."
225,4.0,"I'm not really a shopping person but I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of street food here. Sometimes it's a bit of a puzzle to find out what is being prepared/sold, but that's part of the fun I guess."

230,5.0,"This has absolutely everything you could imagine for shopping, and incredible food stalls all along the way. Why had I never had a cheese scallop before?Incredible."
231,4.0,"Great place to find all the Korean beauty products, shop!  Don't miss Lotte department store food court and market. Just the best."
232,4.0,"Myeongdong street is huge and mainly dominated by cosmetics shops so if you have that shopping list from friends & family to fill, this would be the perfect place.You will find cosmetics shops every step of the way and the face masks are at ridiculously cheap prices in packs. You can find Zara, Adidas, Nike and a few other famous shops too. There's also street stalls selling Supreme goods (fufu or fake, obviously) and food which can be quite expensive, in my opinion. If you are looking for endless options of clothes, head over to Dongdaemun instead."
233,4.0,The street is very busy with many shops and restaurants. It is full most of the day and offers a nice insight into the local city life.
234,4.0,"I came here just because I know this area is famous, but really and truly you should only come here if you need makeup, skin care products, or the like. There are SO many stores selling all kinds of products for skin; I think I saw over 200 different brands of face masks that day. It was also hot and very crowded, so prepare for that as I'm under the impression that it's generally like that. There were people on the streets giving out samples too in an attempt to get you to come into their stores. They'll particularly target you if you're a foreigner, so be prepared to say ""no thank you"" in Korean if you want to politely and not ""noobishly"" turn them down. Overall, it's a cool place. If you're in Seoul I definitely recommend going just to check it out, especially if you want to buy makeup or face masks or something like that. There are some restaurants there too, as well as coffee shops so you can also stop for food or a snack if you need to. Not to mention, Myeongdong is pretty central to the city - my friend and I walked to Namdaemun market from there, as well as Namsan tower in the evening, and it was a really nice walking day (so wear close toed shoes). The subway is also close, and the area where you get off the subway right next to the big Myeongdong market area is also nice and has a Lotte Mart, a Daiso, and a bunch of other stores there too. It's a very nice place to visit :)"
235,4.0,"exit via  Myeong-dong Subway Station, it is really aceessible. street local delicacies. so many starbucks around. heaven for the ladies! must visit when you are in seoul!"

237,5.0,"Myeongdong is more than a street is a place where you can see how Seoulians are living, shopping and entertaining. You can taste some street food, enjoy restaurants offering different cuisines, make some shopping. But at the end, you will definitely feel happy. Don't miss visiting this shopping area."
238,5.0,I love the beauty products and kpop stuff. You can also enjoy yummy food here. Enjoy nanta show if you have time.
239,5.0,"If you're really into Korean skincare, cute accessories or trendy clothes this is definitely a place for you to visit! The only thing is it can get quite crowded here especially towards the evening, but visiting a bit earlier before sunset around 6pm ish is still ok. There are also loads of street foods to try out and restaurants ticked away to help re-energise you for more shopping! The sales assistants are all lovely and helpful and not too pushy."
240,4.0,"Don't do like I did and go there before 5PM. Although all shops will be open, you won't find the most important: the food stalls, which arrive at 5PM. Most of the stores are for women. A lot of cosmetics, accessories and clothing. It's a nice place to go at night."
241,5.0,Great place to do shopping be careful like everything is so cute and you can find all kind of stuffs so it's better to leave this place for the last day in Seoul so you will not worry about your budget and buy whatever you want.
242,3.0,"Great area to explore and do some shopping and food sampling.  Lots of cosmetics if you're into that. Slightly better at night as more food vendors are open for business. Great variety and inexpensive way to try authentic Korean street food. Not a lot of friendly faces, but easy to point at what you want to purchase. Recommended as 'one of the top 10 things to do in Seoul'."
243,4.0,"Myeongdong is one of the busiest places in Seoul and it is considered Korea's premier shopping destination. It is a stunning shopping district with countless shops and restaurants. With Lotte and Shinsegae anchoring the area and a number of large shopping malls lie along the streets. Clothing shops or cosmetics can be seen at a very corners and streets stall for the spaces in between offering tasty street food snacks and inexpensive clothes and accessories. Can be easily reach by taking the Subway: Subway Line 2 Euljiro 1-ga Station Exit 6 and Subway Line 2 Myeongdong Station Exit 6. Myeong-dong combination of historical significance, nearby tourist attractions, and prime shopping has established it as the ultimate tourist destination in Seoul."
244,5.0,"Ladies, this place is heaven 😉 Seven shops out of ten is a cosmetic or skin care shop. The choice is enormous. There are lots of places to eat around, some stalls with street food and just fun place to be😁"
245,3.0,"Its no doubt that this is a good place for shopping. I don't really enjoy shopping, so i don't find this place suits me. There's delicious food stall around, I enjoyed the food. However not very friendly staff, I don't feel welcomed."
246,4.0,"Very busy neighborhood, but great for shopping. Cosmetic stores are all over the place, you can shop and then relax with a great Korean massage!"
247,5.0,"I bought some branded green tea cleansing foam at a duty free shop at US$6 each, yet to my surprise the same product at the branch shop of the brand at Myeongdong was only sold at W8,000 for buy one get one, i.e. W4,000 each, which is about US$3.5 only!!So good!"
248,5.0,"You must walk up and down the streets of Myeongdong as they are akin to the night street stalls of Hong Kong.  Very lively, entertaining and exciting."
249,5.0,"A place that you gotta visit carefully :)) Take your time, look around shops, decide what exactly you need to buy and which shop offers something that you need. Almost every shop offers tax refund when you purchase is 30.000 won or more. So to avoid unnecessary purchases take a thorough look through the offers first ;)And of course try local street food, it is absolutely safe to eat and delicious!!!"
250,2.0,"Won't go back unless visiting some named restaurants there. Then again, can find alternatives elsewhere. Too crowded and nothing much to shop. Go if you want to buy local made cosmetic."
251,5.0,"If you like to shop, this is where you want to be.  This area has all the major shops and a lot of vendors on the street as well.  You definitely will not find a shortage of face masks or Korean bbq.  This area seems to be crowded no matter what time you go.  A good place to go if you're looking for a shopping spree!"
252,5.0,"Such a lively shopping area that becomes even livelier at night!  I walked through this area during the day and loved it.  Its full of great shops and food!  Even better, as the sun sets, food vendors line the streets with so many amazing choices.  Visit at night if possible.  The stores stay open late and its just a fun atmosphere."
253,5.0,"If you are into cosmetics,  you can find anything any everything here!  Plus, if you are a night owl like me, it's pumping till midnight with food vendors and all kinds of stores!  There was a money exchange place that gave better exchange than at the airport.  There was also a police booth for tourists who needed information.  It felt very safe and comfortable!"
254,5.0,"It's a great place to shop for skincare and make up. If I ever run low, I think I will make a trip to Korea to buy them. They give you one for one or free things or samples but only if you look hesitant. I was buying something for a friend and the assistant knew I was going to get it no matter what so I didn't get much. Some assistants (Chinese) are very rude and will tell you to scram if you don't buy."
255,4.0,"I enjoyed being part of the scene which I have always read about! Can find almost every other brand of Korean skincare and cosmetic product here - most of the major brands have at least 2 outlets. It is totally a shopping heaven for me as some of the brands and products are not commonly found back home. Laneige products are definitely a great deal after tax refund and the discounts given! While most shops are not as active in giving masks or products to ""lure"" you into their shop as I had read previously, it is more about getting products I really needed and not on impulse.The street food at night is a scene to experience as well, but they are not cheap at all! The street lobster stall, I overheard, was more than 10,000 won. Quite pricey if you thinking about street food standard. But there were many other things to see and buy (socks, accessories, stationary) and many restaurants to choose from (but mostly only korean food only). There is a store selling toasted sandwich which is delicious!"
256,3.0,All the shops are that you can see in your country easily. What you can do is just watching shops and shopping.
257,5.0,"Lots of fashion outlets and beauty outlets.The shopping belt is divided into different corners and alleys within the same vicinity. You might be spoilt for choices. Clothes, cosmetics, face masks, shoes, bags etc.Also getting lots of attention is soft ice-cream at a height of 30cm."
258,5.0,"After reading other reviews on shopping in this district of Seoul, I have found them to be quite accurate!I am always searching for unique and cost effective items wherever in the world I travel. I make an effort to avoid tourist trap shops so, I dove into Myeondong in the evening picking up last minute buys before I headed back to the States. I was struck by the many street food vendors, which I could not resist.  After fishcake snacks on a stick, vendors were literally tossing facial masks at you to entice you into their shops.  The shops duplicate themselves,  at least 3-4 of the same shop can exist on one block alone. Once you accept a facial mask, of course one feels obligated to go in, browse around and pick up something. For example In one shop, I purchased 20 facial masks for 5.90 WON.  At the current exchange rate, approximately less than $5.00USD.  The buys are there.From cosmetics and a few scattered clothing shops, and costume jewelry, I would recommend this area for landing great cosmetic deals and a festive yummy street food scene."
259,4.0,"I suppose I should be used to Asian shopping streets by now, but it seems I am not. Myeongdong is bright, vibrant, full of locals and foreigners alike, shopping in a range of shops that start at small and rather mysterious and move on up to big, bright, fancy, loud. Interspersed are restaurants and some street food that is mystifying, scary, and - often - smelling really good. Not that I can identify much of what's on offer. Korea has much the same attitude about shopping that Japan does (as much of the world seems to as well), treating it as an activity rather than a necessity, an event, a day or night out. I can't quite get my head around that idea, but I must say that Myeongdong is an experience. Once, however, was enough for me."
260,4.0,"Very exciting area, full of shopping and eating possibilities. Excellent and tasty must try street food. If you're looking for the latest brand names for skin care and sports wear, you will certainly find it in Myeongdong. A huge choice of local food restaurants, of different cost levels, especially the wonderful Korean Barbecue"
261,5.0,What place to visit if you like shopping and food but be warned there are hundreds of people after 3pm
262,4.0,All the famous Korean skincare and cosmetic stores are all located in here. I went there for a one person Korean BBQ which was awesome. I like the crane machine there because I got 5 dolls in total.
263,4.0,"We had intentionally booked a hotel in this street as we know that it is a shopping district and lively by night. True enough, it is! The street is filled with cosmetic shops with different brands and clothing shops. There is also lots of eateries, coffee shops, convenient stores and even a bank. It is like a street mall with everything inside!  At night, it is livelier with food vendors in the street and lots of people outside. You will never got tired in walking in Myeongdong."
264,4.0,Nice place. Good Street food. Lots of beauty Products. Its a must-visit if you are in Seoul! Easy to take metro to myeongdong and come hungry. I fint like Street food normally but this is something else...new tastes and fin experience 🤣
265,4.0,Great shopping area with lots to see and experience. The place has lots of restaurants as well! And ladies can get most if not all the cosmetic brands there.
266,5.0,Anyone who loves to shop should be at Myeongdong. Also there are street food at every corner to satisfy those hungry stomach.
267,4.0,Very busy and buzzing shopping area. Many eating places to choose from and lots of coffee shops. All the top brands and many other shops where you can shop at. Clean and even has smoking huts so people do not smoke in the streets.
268,1.0,"A lot of shops, mainly skincare. But the salespeople where almost aggressive when they wanted you to come into the shops. Basically it's the exact same shops as everywhere, but more frantic. I seriously don't recommend it for shopping. Choose one of the biggest malls instead."
269,4.0,"In this and the adjacent streets, you will find something for everybody, both in terms of shopping and dining."
270,5.0,"A heaven of cosmetic Korea. I love here. It's not the first time I come here. But whenever I come, I always find the exciting things. If you can, look for a local friends, you can try soju, tokpoki, maekoli,.. in a small tent together. Not many Koreans speak English but I'm sure they are so friendly.Don't forget to enjoy street food here"
271,4.0,This area is a good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need. It is filed with so many vendors and stores selling anything and everything a tourist and local may want and need. Allow yourself a couple hours here as you can get lost in the alleys that make up this shopping area.
272,5.0,"I did not imagine I will enjoy Myeongdong. Such a nice experience esp. for street food lovers! There are lots of restos also, plus beauty products stores."
273,5.0,Great street to stroll around when you have some free time. You can buy a lost of reasonably priced items and delicious street food. I don't think anyone should PAY to go on  a tour here- just do it yourself.
274,5.0,What a shopping experience.In terms of the array and diversity truly amazing.Local food offerings looked most interesting too.
275,5.0,"This is a must visit for shopaholics. You can find literally every thing from almost every brand, be it luxury or local. You cannot finish strolling all the streets in just ine day. I have been there for several times and every time I discovered something new. Even if you don't love shopping, you have to go there for the wide array of street foods it has to offer. You can also find some halal street foods there. Honey garlic shrimp and barbecue chicken has been my favourites. These shops are usually open till late so I suggest visiting at night. This place has something for everyone."
276,4.0,"The travelled date was actually end March/ early April 2016.   I was in Seoul for 12 days and stayed in Myeongdong area because it was convenient for transport to sightsee.  The hotel I stayed in was only 10 minute walk from Myeongdeong street area where the real buzz starts from  5.00 pm till late.  Bargains galore for quick souvenirs.....scarves, caps, pins/brooches,  ........I love the socks, at AUD 1.00 per pair, great for souvenirs and they're quite good quality ( popular among locals too).   Because this area is closed to traffic, many shops  operate during the day too.  Every other shop sells Korean beauty products.   Clothing wise....don't bother if you're above size 12 ( I think that's Euro size 36 ??).However,  it's the street stalls which draw the crowds.  Grilled, fried, baked.....from ever favourite octopus/squids, pancakes, rice cakes in hot sauce ( I love the cheese ones) , sticks of fish cakes, etc.   They're not as cheap as you think but prepare to pay around Aud 5 a 10 for any single serve.  The large scallop, cooked in shell with toppings of corn, cheese...was imo most expensive at nearly AUD15.  It was strawberry season and they're sweeter than sweet....must try (I ate about 2kgs over the entire stay).   Boxes of dried peaches/persimmons were a little too marked up in price.  Plenty of other outlets serving Korean, Japanese and some western.  Money changers are aplenty here."
277,5.0,With so much going on this is certainly an attack on the senses! Shopping and ratting galore! I even found a cat cafe here!

Hahaha!)"
280,4.0,"Tourist spot for Korean cosmetics and apparels. Nothing to worry about if you're tired from walking, hopping from one store to another as food stalls are everywhere at the middle of the road. Restaurants and fine dining are also abound. I always come back here for the Dakgalbi rice at Yoogane; great way to restore your energy after walking around the streets of Myeongdong. You can also choose to relax at Lotte mall and even watch a movie if you want to; they play english movies too!"
281,5.0,This is the place you need to go to buy cosmetics and beauty products. It has the best brand of cosmetics. There's also good street food.
282,4.0,"This is the area if you want to shop till you drop. I was looking for gift ideas for all my family members and manage to get them all something. Lots of small gift shops, plenty of different food items, coffee shops, etc in this area. The crowds are plentiful but you can manage to get around."
283,3.0,"It is great seeing typical localised shops with their localised merchandise, its even better when the money-changer exchange rate is higher than SG.Lots of buses that leads to places like Namsan Park, Palace and Square. Some parts of the streets are lined with white cherry blossom; its gorgeous and within reach from the bus-ride."
284,5.0,The street food and shopping are amazing.  Would recommend people to check this place out. I have really enjoyed the street food.
285,5.0,Truly a cosmetic and shopping haven. :) interesting finds at discounted prices with freebies. I look forward to going to Seoul because of Myeongdong experience
286,4.0,"Shopping, shopping and shopping. The main street is crowded with food stalls and each corner leads to yet another shop. Recommend a walk around even if you're not up for shopping just to get a feel of the shopping craziness."
287,4.0,"Very crowded, a lot of street food, a lot of vendors, and a lot of stores for clothing and cosmetics. It is a great tourist spot for shopping and food, a little to crowded for my liking but still a good and seems to be a safe spot to visit."
288,3.0,Busy part of town and ok if you like chain stores/ high end shopping. Plenty of food available usually at inflated prices. I lived Seoul but this was not my favourite part.
289,5.0,"Arrived at 9pm on a Friday and it was packed. Vast area with brand name stores that you see on 5th Ave, but also small bargain shops and street vendors."
290,5.0,"This was one of the best parts of my trip. I took the blue line Subway and changed to the 4 line and went shopping. This place has many many makeup stores and discounted prices. In the evening or late after noon there are food vendors set up all along the streets. There are also great restaurants on the side streets. There are department stores as well as boutiques. I am large compared to the locals but I found a sweater coat, a shirt as well as face masks, eyebrow pencils, lipsticks that would go well with my dark skin color also. It was just great. I went back three times during my time in South Korea."
291,5.0,"Out of four days in Seoul, we spent two straight days here. And I mean all day. Save yourself some time by doing some homework of which products or at least  brands you want to try or purchase. If not, you'll be spending hours here just walking in and out of every store. Each major brand will have at least 5-8 branches within a few block radius so don't sweat if you changed your mind. Feel free to go in and try and ask questions. The staff are quite incredible almost everywhere. Multi lingual and really helpful. The street vendors sell great stuff too at incredible cheap prices. However. Don't forget to haggle! (Not with the food vendors)"
292,5.0,"Its SUPERB and PERFECT for both men and women. While your ladies are going crazy to shop their buy 1 get 1 sheet mask and stuff, you can just go grab a baked cheese scallop or tteokpokki and etc. Its just crazy in Myeongdong. The street food taste sooooo amazing, and so many unique and tempting snack too..ahh.. i would love to go back to korea soon..very soon hopefully.."
293,5.0,"Lots of things are happening on this street. Will take you more than 3 hours, luckily I chose this neighborhood to stay. You can get any kind of Korean cosmetic and make-up products, international fashion brands, local fashion brands, local mom and pop shops, street food (only in evening) and duty-free shops. I found the best food gem to be the local places upstairs or in the basement. I had the best Korean fried chicken there. During christmas time, tons of christmas lights on the buildings and nearby parks."
294,5.0,A lot of street food in the evening and shops to visit. Very convenient as it is located near a lot other places of attractions.
