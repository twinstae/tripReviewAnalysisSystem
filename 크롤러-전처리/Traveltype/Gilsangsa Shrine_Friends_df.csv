0,4.0,"It's certainly very new as far as temples go, but I wanted to see it due to its unique history. It seems the website describes the property as a former restaurant, which it technically was, but in reality it was a famed gisaeng house where back door politics would regularly take place. The owner, a former gisaeng herself, donated the property and it reopened as a temple in 1997. It still retains the original structures, and the grounds are fairly large and a bit different in layout from other temples I've seen. Worth a stop if you're in the area to see the Furniture Museum and are interested in the history."

It is a little bit of a walk from the main street, although there is a shuttle service bus from one of the bus stops along the street. We went a little late in the evening so there werenâ€™t many people. Very peaceful and quiet and if you venture further in towards the back of the temple you could get very nice views of Seoul. Korean temples tend to be really beautiful and this is no exception."
