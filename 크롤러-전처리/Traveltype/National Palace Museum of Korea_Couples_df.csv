0,5.0,"This museum covering several dynasties of Korea is well worth a visit, and well take you 2-3 hours.  Beautiful displays of wonderful historical objects.  There is a small restaurant on site to take time to relax."
1,4.0,A good place to learn about Korean history. The museum displays a lot of relics from Joseon dynasty to the Korean empire time. I particularly enjoyed watching the documentary of how Gyeongbokgung was constructed. The documentary was shown next to a giant building plan of the palace.
2,5.0,"We thought we might as well look around here whilst visiting the palace and were happy we did. Itâ€™s a small museum but full of lovely things, the staff are so friendly there and seemed happy we had visited, 2 smiling ladies asked us to sign the guestbook and a security guard saw me stamping the rubber stamps in my journal, he came and found me as I was leaving and gave me a stamp booklet (you can get from the desk) filled out with all the stamps- it was just a very thoughtful thing to do"
3,3.0,"Visited the museum after checking out the Gyeongbokgung Palace. There were royal seals on display, a couple of royal cars etc. There were other royal regalia on display. It was alright, since I was there visiting the palace anyway."
4,4.0,We visited this museum first before entering Gyeongbokgung palace. Entry was free and there were some interesting exhibits. Good for a short visit but history buffs would probably stay longer. Easy to access.
5,3.0,"This museum perfectly complements the Gyeongbokgung Palace by showcasing many royal artifacts from the 27 kings of the Joseon Dynasty, including a GM car from the early 20th century. Similar to the National Folk Museum nearby, entrance to this museum is also free although its exhibits are not as enthralling as the National Folk Museum. Your knowledge of the Joseon Dynasty will be complete once you cover the Gyeongbokgung Palace as well as the 2 neighboring museums."
6,5.0,We went here after arriving to visit the Palace on a Tuesday (when it was shut):). So we decided to go into the museum (which is free). We took advantage of the headphone facility in English for a small price and spent the afternoon here. So much to see and read about. So glad in the end that we did this before going to the palace the next week. Great gift shop and video viewing area. Well worth the visit. Allow a few hours if really wanting to get the most from it.
7,4.0,A visit to this museum will give one a brief overview of Korean Palace life. This a good place to visit before going around the palace grounds so one will have a feel of the substance of the palace and other structures.
8,5.0,"Please stop by the museum when you visit the 5 palaces, it is so worth visiting, especially to see the screen"
9,4.0,"While this museum has been around for several years, the current version is a huge improvement over its past.  (Actually, all the Korean national museums have been vastly improved over the past decade - and most of them now have free admission!)It is thoroughly modern with well thought out presentation of a very impressive collection of historical and recreated items and multimedia. Everything is in great preservation and lighting. Though I have lived in Korea for some 20 years, I learned a great deal visiting this museum recently. There is a decent gift shop and very pleasant coffee shop/traditional restaurant on the first floor (which may be mistaken to be in the basement as the main entrance is on the second floor).If you have any kind of interest in Asian royalty, the Joseon period of Korean history or traditional Asian arts, this is an excellent place to spend a half day."
10,4.0,"This is a concise museum right next to the main palace in the Palace District of Seoul, and while not everything was translated in English, my husband and I still learned a lot from this museum. It made our time at the palace more interesting!"
11,3.0,The museum is free and admission does not cost anythingI love the national Palace Museum it's got great display of artwork and history!!! If you are into history and want to learn more about Korea this is the place to go!
12,4.0,Separated into few ares and showing different palaces' history. King's costumes & arts were presented in the museum
13,4.0,"Like many people, we went there just after the Palace. It is right next door and entrance is covered by the same ticket.Nothing exciting or worldview changing here, but they have some nice pieces and they are lovingly displayed. Spacious galleries with well-lit showcases.Most of the exhibits have royal associations, with a particularly fascinating collection of objects associated with venerated royal ancestors. We were also taken with the tuned slabs of slate that can be played like a xylophone, in the musical instrument section.Welcoming restaurant and extensive gift shop in the same warm, modern building. Combine it with the palace and the other museum nearby and you have yourself a day trip.Access from a very convenient subway station."
14,4.0,"The National Palace Museum of Korea (free entry) is one of the two museums located on the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace grounds. Opening Hours are 9-6pm weekdays, 9-7pm weekends, closed on Mondays.  Relocated to the modern building in the southwest part of the Gyeongbokgung, the museum provides visitors opportunity to learn about the Jesong Dynasty, who ruled Korea for five centuries. The collections also provide helpful context behind what you see when walking the palace grounds before or after your visit. There are supposedly over 40,000 historical artefacts at the National Palace Museum, with a  handful of which are considered national treasures. The museum is spread over three floors and includes 11 permanent exhibition where you find historical portraits and paintings, maps, manuscripts, palace furniture, royal clothing, instruments, items of early astronomy and many more wonderful possessions associated with Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Royal family.  Highlights for me included seeing the King Jesong portraits, procession carriages, ancient sundials and the fascinating restored model of Jagyeokru, a large-scale 15th century water clock seen in the Jesong Science Room.  In the end, I really enjoyed this museum collection finding it to have done a fine job of providing context and background to what visitors are seeing in the rest of the palace grounds.  The museum is an intricate part your visit to Gyeongbokgung and shouldn't be skipped if you plan to visit the palace while in Seoul.  You can comfortably see the National Palace Museum of Korea in 30-45 minutes if you are short on time or you can explore the collection more thoroughly and easily spend a couple of hours here as well. Note: There are free guided tours given in Korean, Japanese and English. Check the online website for times and details."
