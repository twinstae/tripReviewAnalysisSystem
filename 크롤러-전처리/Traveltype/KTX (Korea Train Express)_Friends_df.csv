0,4.0,Travelled on KTX to Pyeongchang and the ride is very smooth and comfortable. The KTX App is available in english and it's easy to search and book for your tickets using the app. Book your tickets earlier if you are travelling during the peak season so that you can get a seat.
1,3.0,Fastest way to go to Busan. Clean and spacious inside with free WiFi. Do not expect the bulletin Train like in Japan.
2,5.0,Took the KTX train to Busan (no pun intended). The whole experience was like clock work. Tickets were easy to pre-purchase. Only suggestion would be to purchase the food on the platform rather than commercial options in the plaza.
3,5.0,"The most convenient way to travel to Busan. Ride first class, free water and some mix nuts and cookies."
4,5.0,"We took the KTX bullet Train from Seoul to Gyeongiu ( 2 hour trip),where stayed for a day. We also took the train from Busan back to Seoul ( 2 and one half hour trip).  Tickets and and picks were arranged by our travel agent Kate DeLosso. Tickets seemed to cost about 49-59,000 WON each. We were a little concerned about communication once we were dropped off at the outbound station, but this was unfounded because the information desk was quite helpful and signs for the trains and tracks were clearly marked in English. There were elevators/steps/escalators to get to the tracks. We had to use the elevator because of our suitcases. The trains were on time on both occasions. I loved that seats were assigned. Trains were clean. There were a group school kids in our train car, going on field trips, on our first train. They were the friendliest group of kids I have met, trying to engage us in small talks. Great way to move from city to city in South Korea. My only hang up was lugging the suitcase and bag. It was a good experience (unlike our bullet train ride from London to Paris and back, broke down twice, and no apologies). I would recommend the KTX train if you plan to visit these cities."
5,5.0,"We took KTX from incheon airport to Seoul station to Busan.  It was on a Monday.  I read that we can go directly from incheon airport to Busan but that wasn't true.  We had to buy a ticket to Seoul Station first.  They have discounts if you traveled with one of the Korean air carriers at the kiosks.  Kiosks are easy to navigate in English. Or  They also have a special at the desk,  three people for 24000 won.  At Seoul station,  you have to go up to the second floor and buy tickets at the kiosks. The desk lines are slow.  The train tracks area are easily marked with numbers.  The tickets have a cabin number and seat number on it.  They can be strict about it if you aren't in the correct cabin. There is a bathroom on the train and luggage storage. They do random ticket check on boardIncheon airport to Seoul station takes about 35 minutes. Then We bought the fastest to Busan,  2.5 hours.  ~59800 won each. No discount I believe."
6,5.0,We took the Busan-Seoul route. It was a very quick and comfortable ride. The seats are comfortable and the train is very clean.
7,5.0,The price isn't cheap but it takes you where you need in a fast and comfortable way. Large seats. Respect timetable.
8,4.0,"You can book online which ia slightly cheaper, however i would suggest you to pay slightly more (than online fare) - arrive at the station and decide the next departure. You can easily book your train. There are many trains for you to choose according to the time you prefer. There are lots of food and convenient store around the station.The train leaves and arrive on time"
9,4.0,"We took KTX twice, once from Pyeongchang to Seoul and then from Seoul to Busan. The train was absolutely on time, clean as a whistle and had comfortable seating. The main difference between these trains and the ones in Taiwan is that in Taiwan they serve tea or juice on the longer runs and in Korea they did not, but this is not really a problem. Just bring your own. The stations were large and open, capable of handling high volumes of traffic efficiently. The signage was generally very good, with English signs for Europeans and signs in Chinese and Japanese as well. The language diversity of the train system was laudable. I would gladly travel this way again. It offers a much better chance to see the country than flying."
10,4.0,"Our guide took care of the tickets and all that, so I can't say if it is easy to get tickets. But the trains are comfortable, there is information in English. There are power outlets so you can charge your phone."
11,3.0,"This train service is the fastest train in Korea, they can reach speed above 270 KM/H but unfortunately this service is not running in dedicated line but sharing with other train service. If you have sensitive ear than maybe a problem with with your ear. Seat is decent in terms of pitch and width."
12,4.0,"This is an excellent train company, at least on the two long distance trips that I took. The trains were impressively clean and on time. The costs are also very reasonable. The bullet train was impressively quick and handy for the centre of Busan and Seoul."
13,4.0,"The first time to take KTX from Seoul to Busan, efficiency with a high speed. Comfortable seats that are good for sleep in the morning or the midnight."
14,5.0,"At speeds reaching 295 km/hr, I found this an amazing way to travel Korea. Train was on time. Easy and relatively inexpensive ticketing. Clean. Great layout at stations. Seats with phone charging ability. Snack vending machines and toilets on board."
15,5.0,"fast, convenient, extremely clean, great impression of the Korean countryside, unforgettable experience"
16,5.0,"I caught the KTX train to Busan. It was easy to manage at the station as the signs were very clear, we had numbered seats which were very comfortable. This is definitely the way to move around quickly."
17,5.0,"I travelled from Seoul to Busan round trip in October on the KTX,  The trip was easy to book online and left and returned to Seoul Station.  If you catch a taxi and have luggage, be sure to ask the driver to drop you close to the elevator at Seoul Station.  Train travel is  a lot more relaxing than flying, having to be at the airport early, and having to deal with standing in lines for security and collecting your luggage.   All train stops are announced in five languages."
18,4.0,"the ride was enjoyable. I was able to enjoy some nice scenery on the way to Busan. Even though, we choose the economy seat, it was very clean and quite spacious."
19,5.0,"We took the KTX from Seoul to Pusan (Busan).  Our hosts paid for our tickets and we went 1st Class.  It was very spacious and comfortable.  There are great views of the Korean countryside, which is very pleasant, especially the rice paddy fields.  The train is quiet and you don't realise how fast you are going until you pass a train coming in the opposite direction.  With both trains travelling at close to 300 km/hr, a 200-metre long train flashes by in less than 1 second."
20,4.0,"I use the KTX for business trips.  The trains are punctual.  Once in the train, the car seats are comfortable.  Would be great if they had charging stations.  Otherwise, the KTX is a great comfortable ride when traveling in Korea city to city."
21,5.0,"travel a few time with the ktx and i like it a lot, it cost a lot more then normal train but you are much faster at you destination. second class is realy good, enough legg space, ...toillets are clean, free wifi,i recoment it for sure if you travel far."
22,5.0,"A very comfortable ride to Busan. It was on time. If the tickte shows the departure time is 6am, the train's door will be closed at 6 am."
23,5.0,"Fast, clean, and friendly staffs. I am shocked by the fact that the staff did not even check our tickets. I love how they easily believe in people. I feel so safe and welcome along the trip."
24,4.0,"Totally smooth travel from Seoul to Daegu.it also provides wifi and power points.if you're going to daegu or seoul, the KTX is the way to go"
25,5.0,"Book tru changiwifi (SG) 3 day KTX Seoul to Busan. After confirmation, we reserved our date, time and seat no tru KTX direct website. We can straightaway print their train tickets(showing train no.)Actual day, 20 min before departure, check the station board which track is your train.(No need to go to KTX counter)Limited luggage rack. Best to travel light.On board staff never check our train tickets and depart on schedule.KTX train stop abt 5 station in between. It took 3 hr ride.Return to Seoul, we reserved 1 day in advance the date & time at KTX counter, paying about SGD15 for first class seat which more comfy/snack/drinks available (free). 30 min before departure, just check which track is your train no. on.Travel Light!!..."
26,5.0,"If you want a faster way to go to seoul from incheon airport, hop on to ktx. It's very comfortable train going to the city."
27,3.0,"There's hardly any room for luggages, though passing staff were helpful and accommodating to help us place the luggages near the doors of the train."
28,5.0,"I have taken the KTX numerous times on different connections.  The trains are always punctual to the minute, they are always clean and very comfortable.  And nobody will use his cell phone in the compartment!!!"
29,4.0,"The trains were fast and comfortable. People were allotted seats, so no mess there. I wish the train had more amenities and stayed at the stops for maybe longer durations. Otherwise, very fast and convenient."
30,5.0,"I bought the Korail Pass for foreigners as it offered unlimited rides for the day, which was cheaper and timings more flexible than 2 1-way tickets. There are discounts for groups of 2 pax and above. We had made ticket reservations a day in advance but missed our return train. No need to panic as trains between Seoul and Busan depart every 15 min or so. We were prepared to pay a penalty fee if needed, but maybe because we had the 1-day Korail Pass, which offered unlimited rides for the day, the staff only cancelled the departed train tics and gave new tics. No penalty fees! However as it was a last min reservation, we weren't able to sit together. At least it's better than standing tics for 2 hr 40 min!!There're no food bars on the train so be prepared to buy food for long journeys from the station's many food outlets. Luggage racks are available at the ends of each train carriage but it's small so best to go early to reserve spots for your luggage. Usually the train gets into the platform about 20 min before the departure time."
31,5.0,"We travelled from Seoul to Busan by KTX (Korean Train Express). It was a comfortable, time saving and fast journey. It just took us 2 hours 45 minutes.We pre-booked our tickets at Seoul station, if you don't do this in advance you risk not getting a seat and will have to stand for your journey. There were vending machines on board if you wanted refreshments and Seoul station had tons of coffee shops and restaurants if you want snacks for your journey. Pretty much all KTX trains to Busan depart from platform 6, the screens in the stations are clear so it should be obvious which platform is required.The seats were spacious and comfy and the views from Seoul to Busan were amazing! The TV screens in the carriages clearly display which stop is coming up."
32,5.0,The best option for taking to/from Incheon Airport.  It cost less than any other options & is faster.
33,5.0,"KTX is a great train ride. If you get the right train with little scheduled stops, you can get from Seoul to Jinbu/Gangneung is just over an hour. It is fairly inexpensive and the first class ticket includes water and a snack. There is free wifi on the train and there is a lot of room in the seats."
34,5.0,"We took the KTX in Seoul to attend the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. The train system is very clean, including the washrooms. The trains were excellent value for the money we spent. They have seated tickets, as well as, standing room tickets that are less-expensive. These seats are located behind the last row of seats in each car or in the sections between train cars where there are two  bumper-type seats like the ones flight attendants often use on airplanes. The conductors are friendly and helpful. Be careful that you have the correct tickets for your journey because the conductor will issue a penalty ticket. The KTX was a wonderful experience for us, giving us the opportunity to travel quickly and efficiently to attend the Olympics."
35,5.0,KTX is a very fast and convenient way of travelling on different cities in South Korea! One very useful advise for more convenient travel is to book in advance thru their online website.
36,4.0,Great way to travel long distance around Korea. Punctual time schedule. Easy to purchase tickets online.
37,4.0,"The Korean Train Express is the best choice for you to get to another city across the nation. It is more efficient than taking a plane, and the price won't hurt your wallet. You can get a 10% discount for a group consist of 10 person. The train is fast, clean, and for travelers with some big cases, do not afraid, there is luggage in every train section for you. If you are a group travelers that bring so many bags and cases, I recommend you to take the last train section since it near the main luggage which will give you more flexibility to put you bags and cases."
38,4.0,We have used the KTX to get from our home in Seoul to both Gimpo and Incheon airports as well as for day trips outside of Seoul. The train schedule is often very convenient to use as many routes have trains every 15 mins. The KTX is also very affordable.
39,5.0,"Recommended taking the train to get around Seoul. It is so convenient. Buy the subway card anywhere from 3000 to 10000 won. Then fill the card with money to for your rides. For each ride it is 1.25. They train is clean and safe. The subway is underground. There are different colors coded subway. Each represent different locations, but it is easy to read. Bring a good pair of sneakers because you will be doing a lot of walking. Trains run pretty late."
40,3.0,"Boarded the train to Busan from Seoul with friends. The whole journey took approximately 2hours and 40mins. We purchased the tickets directly from KTX counter located in Incheon airport and the seat numbers were assigned to you automatically. The counter staff speaks limited English but tried her very best to answer our questions. The train was very punctual and they also provide USB ports for you to charge your gadgets in the train. This is a big plus!However I found that travelers with big luggages like us will have a problem as there are limited spaces to store it.Luckily, their staff were kind enough to help us out by finding a place for us to keep our luggages."
41,4.0,"Comfortable enough, clean and more or less on time. Great ride quality and service. We went to Busan on the SRT which was newer and had better seats but the speed was similar. One difference we found was the the KTX and SRT run from different stations in Seoul.  The KTX air conditioning was barely up to the job. Rather to warm."
42,3.0,Hi! Hope someone can help me out with this query. I have booked my korail pass ticket online for the flexi 4 day pass on the mistaken assumption that this allows me to visit (i.e stay in) Busan for 4 days not realising that it allows me to do 4 travels with korail (as the instruction on the Korail website was really confusing). I had made my seat reservation online for only 1 of the 4 days. Can i cancel the ticket for the unused 3 days? Thanks much in advance!!
43,5.0,"After watching the movie Train to Busan, my friends and I decided to experience taking the KTX to Busan. We bought tickets online beforehand. There were some discounts if you fall into categories like buying it in a group or if you are in a specific age range so remember to check it out online. From Seoul Station, we handed over our printed information and exchanged tickets on the day where we wanted to take the KTX. There were loads of restaurants and convenient stores to get food and drinks there. You are also welcomed to take food up onto the train. Everything was quite clear from the station, just remember to get on the right train, right cart and right seat. The train was really fast and quiet. Free wifi provided which was really fast as well. Overall, lovely experience and totally recommended."
44,5.0,"Very convenient to take Airport Express Train which is affordable (KRW8,000) and takes about 43 minutes from Airport to Seoul Station non stop... Even with large luggage, still very convenient to take :) always quite empty whenever I visit Seoul in (Apr,May,Oct) period :)Not packed with passenger because there is another option (9 train stop) for the locals (pay about almost half price lesser and took about 1hr)"
45,5.0,Just by standing on the platform and observing going trains is great and shocking. Travel by the train is comfortable and fast. No problems with luggage. There is sufficient time to get on and get off.
46,5.0,Very efficient and cost effective way to travel between Seoul and Busan.  Assigned seating which was nice and minimal delays.
47,3.0,The train is well maintained with smooth travel. The train is also clean and seats are arranged in such a way that half of seats arr opposite to each other per car.For long distance is good to travel by bullet ttain. It is experience as the speed can exceed 300km per hour.
48,5.0,"Really comfortable, fast and clean! Fares from Seoul-Busan go around 45-50,000 wons. Best way to cross the country"
49,5.0,"Took the KTX from Seoul to Busan on 20 Dec and Busan to Seoul on 22 Dec. My friend and I bought the 3-Day saver ticket for 2 pax. With the confirmation letter, you will need to exchange for a ""card"" at the information office if you are travelling from Seoul Station. With the card, you can join the normal queue to redeem the tickets for the train of your choice assuming that there are still seats. I'm not sure if you can just buy the tickets straight from the ticketing counter. You most probably can but you would have to get past the language barrier if you are enquiring about anything complicated.There are quite a few timings to choose from so even if you miss the ideal ride, the next train may depart within 15mins or so. For example, we couldn't make it for the 3.35pm ride from Busan to Seoul but the next one was 3.45pm. This information is available at the ticketing counter, visible while one queues for ticket.The train is clean. Food and beverage is sold on board. However, you can bring your own food to munch on. It is a good mode of transport - convenient and connected to city centre and other sites."
50,5.0,"Our schedule was so tight that travelling via KTX really help as it cut down the journey  time from Seoul to Busan to only 2 and half hours. Following will be my experience using KR pass to travel with KTX. I bought KR Pass in my country using my debit card, had the e-ticketing printout ready and just head to the counter to exchange the printout with real pass. I had the exchange at Singyeongju Station early in the morning (at 6.30 a.m.) and I chose to activate both travelling dates for 2-day flexible pass on that spot. For flexible pass, you can choose the date that you wish to travel either during the exchange or later and the date will be printed on the pass. Using the pass, I bought KTX ticket from that counter. I decided to bought for return journey as well. Using KR pass for foreigner is much cheaper than buying the regular ticket. Instead of 100+ dollar for return ticket from Seoul - Busan, I just spent 81 dollar (youth price).  The train is so efficient. It arrived on time and the train itself is very clean and comfortable. The coach has overhead compartment to store small sized bag. For bigger size luggage, there will be luggage storage at the entrance of every coach."
51,5.0,"I've been used KTX services twice. The route was Busan-Seoul & Daejeon-Seoul. The ticketing is very convenient too, it can be purchased online (letskorail.com) or on the counter at the KTX station. Basically there are 3 type of ticket which are first class, standard class & non-assign seat ticket. It is very clean, seat are comfortable & there is baggage area where you can left your big luggage there."
52,3.0,"Not very big difficult with others country train (ex. : Taiwan High Speed Train, Japan High Speed Train)But you may try to take the experience cause the movie train to Busan is use the KTX :pFor my thinking is very expensive cause if you book early then the flight actually is cheaper a lot than the KTX train but depend your itinerary If you use more then take the day pass is consider cheap also :)"
53,5.0,"Have always been very keen to experience a Bullet train and it was a revelation to know that S Korea has several.  It was an opportunity not to be missed. The KoRail website seemed to require online booking, but we had difficulty navigating the site. Decided to chance it by getting to the booking office at Seoul station by 8am opening time. Opted for a 2hr ride to Dongdaegu and and in minutes walked away with return tickets for a day trip to the south eastern city.Platform has plaques with carriage numbers, so boarding was very orderly. The seats are better than airline seats. When reclined the back does not encroach on the person sitting behind. The lower part of the seat moves forward. The ride is quite amazing smooth as ever hitting speed of 295KM/h!"
54,5.0,We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. The ride was smooth and comfortable. I can't believe that the train can travel at speeds of 190 mph.
55,5.0,"Planned a day to Busan and decided to give the KTX a whirl since it takes about 2 hrs and 40 minutes from Seoul Station to Busan Station. Since we were only going for a day, it seemed logical to take the fastest means of public transportation. Because we were visitors, I was able to buy our one day pass ahead of time. They have different passes to accommodate your travel needs. After searching, the pass is certainly the cheaper way to go except that you cannot make seat reservations ahead of time.  Luckily, we got to Seoul Station early and loads of seats available. We exchanged our vouchers for passes and got our seats sitting together without any problems. Ask the agent at that time if you can reserve your seats for your return. Boarding the train was simple and straightforward... when your train number is ready to board, you board train/car/seat number. The cart was very clean and comfortable (seemed a littke roomier than airplane seats and had a foot rest). Sufficient room above your head to store your bags. I didn't check the bathrooms. There is Wifi onboard the KTX the entire way with the exception of going through tunnels. You can get alot of work done or watch a couple of kdrama episodes. Time flew and before I knew it we were at Busan Station. On the return, since we had made our reservations for our return in Seoul, all we had to do was check the board and when our train was boarding, repeat the process. There is also an attendant walking through with a cart full of snacks. Be sure to pick up fish cakes at the Busan station... very long line but its worth it! Thank you KTX for a smooth and quick trip to Busan."
56,5.0,"Love the KTX between Seoul and Busan, which is certainly better than flying. The service takes you from centre to centre with good transport links. It is very comfortable and you will can feel the speed as it hurtles between north and south."
57,4.0,"Bought a ticket from Seoul station bound for Busan. It costs me ₩59,800 per trip (departing from Seoul station to Busan station). The intervals of the trains to Busan from Seoul station are very close. I managed to buy the ticket last minute over the counter at Seoul station departing on the same day. The staff can speak a little bit of english and she will ask you regarding the time slot that you want. The ticket will indicate your Car No and Seat No. Check out for the track no. on the big screen in Seoul station to access the train that you will need to board. The whole journey takes about less than 2 hour 40 minutes.During the journey, there will be a food cart moving around in the train. You can buy some food and beverages (e.g. bread and coffee) but are quite pricey. I would rather buy some food and drinks in the train station and eat it in the train.Overall, it is very convenient and one of the fastest ways (another alternative apart from taking airplane) get to your destination out of seoul. To buy the ticket, you can buy it online and collect it at the train station. You can buy a korail pass from korail website. The pass comes in 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, and so on. If you purchase the pass, you will be entitled to unlimited rides on ktx (and some other trains but not subway) for the consecutive days (check out for the instructions and price list on the website). Another way is to buy it over the counter at Seoul station (single trip)."
58,4.0,"We bought our tickets at Seoul Station a few days before departure to Busan. The tickets for KTX cost 58,800 Won. The seats were comfortable but unfortunately our seats were facing backwards. If this is a problem then you should check at time of purchase. It took just 2 hour and 33 minutes. We've found it to be relatively easy eventhough done of us could speak or read Korean."
59,4.0,"If you have many luggage, advise you to book 1st class cabin.Comfortable ride from Busan to Seoul. KTX allow you to change train timing, but best do it over the counter at Busan Station."
60,4.0,"We took the KTX from Busan to Seoul on Saturday morning. The fare is 57,300 won/person for the economy class. We've purchased the tickets online earlier but still need to queue up to reclaim the tickets. Luckily, no long lines as many counters operate.Boarding the train was a bit confusing as there's at least 2 train waiting at the same platform with the same numbers. We also had no idea in which coach needs to be boarded. Well.. maybe this is just happened to us as we're seldom use the train before lol. The journey took 2h 45m and there's free wifi as well as coffee and cake are sold using the trolley along the journey.. but it was a bit pricey 13,000 won for 2 coffees and a muffin.. are you kidding me?. Overall that was a great experience."
61,4.0,This is the best way to travel in Korea as it's time and cost saving. It's comfortable all the way with some beverages selling. But I have some problems traveling with large size luggage. They have only very limited space to store bigger size luggage so try not to bring bigger size luggage. Wifi is bad.
62,3.0,"i reserved the 3-day pass online for me and my friends before travelling to korea, thinking that we can skip the queue when we are at the train station. but we were wrong! firstly, I did not print out the reservation slip but i recorded the confirmation number. the customer service area did not have a printer and insist that i need to show that piece of paper before she can give me another letter that allows me to claim the tickets. we then went to a shop at lvl 1 to print out that slip. after printing out the reservation slip, we went back to the same customer service area and the girl this time said that there was no seatings left for that day and we can only exchange for standing pass for our trip to Busan. if we want a seating, we need to exchange for the pass for another day. she could have told us earlier as the credit card will not be charged as long as the pass has not been redeemed. we could have bought the standing pass without having to print that slip. for those who wish to go to Busan by KTX, try to avoid going on weekends as it is very much more crowded. if not, pls go very early to the station to purchase the tickets to ensure there is a seating. if not, you will have to stand for the 2.5h to Busan."
63,4.0,"I rode the KTX from Busan to Seoul and it makes a few stops but I was amazed how fast it got to Seoul despite that. The seats are comfortable if you can recline but since I sat in the very back against the wall, I could not recline. They even have a snack cart that comes through and if you are fast enough to catch him to see what's on the cart, it is an added bonus. Overall, it is much better than sitting in traffic on the bus, especially if you are on a schedule. If you are travelling with more than one person I would highly suggest booking early, as I was not able to sit with my friend."
64,5.0,"In Seoul the KTX departs from two main stations; Seoul Station and Yongsan Station, depending on your destination.  Usually, if you are going to Daegu or Busan, you will depart from Seoul Station.  If you are going to Gwang Ju or Mokpo, you will usually depart from Yongsan Station.  Be sure you know which station you need to depart from for your trip.  I went to Gwang Ju, so my trip departed from Yongsan Station.  Individual ticket prices were based on two criteria; the day of the week and the class of the seat.  Prices are lower when traveling on Monday-Thursday and increase a little more than $3 USD for the Friday-Sunday tickets.  First Class to Gwang Ju was $50.30 and Economy Class was $35.90 on June 4-5, 2014 (my travel dates).  I would assume the higher prices are also in effect during Korean holidays.I was pleasantly surprised with the First Class section.  There are three seats per row; a single (A) on one side and a pair (B-C) on the other.  The train car was very clean and the seats were large and very comfortable.  There is a newspaper rack as you enter the car.  I found both English (Korean paper written in English) and Korean newspapers.  There is plenty of leg room and the seats recline.  Don't worry to much about bothering the person behind you.  There is more than enough room so that your seat is not in their lap, like on an airplane.  There is overhead racks for your carry-type bags.  If you have a suitcase, there is a place to stow it where you get onto the car.  The ride was very smooth.  There is a monitor dispay in the ceiling of the car that indicates the train's speed (after it reaches a certain threshold).  The fastest speed I saw was 303 kph, which is just under 182 mph.  I noticed one reviewer wrote the train averaged 300 kph.  That's not the case; that's the advertised peak speed... and it will reach that speed.  Another reviewer mentioned ""no talking.""  There are signs on the cars that indicate no loud talking and no cell phone conversations.  If you need to make a call or receive a call, you should go to the area behind the glass door on each end of the car.  It actually has a cell phone logo etched into the glass.  This is where you can talk and not disturb anyone.  My travel partner, the base Chaplain from my first military assignment in Korea, and I had conversations on both the trips to and from Gwang Ju and were never told we couldn't talk.  There was a note in the hand out that indicated there was a WiFi connection in First Class that gave you 30MB free of charge.  I received a message (in Korean) when I tried to connect.  I asked my travel partner what the message said.  He said the service I had requested was no longer available and apologized for any inconvenience.  I think you can purchase prepaid WiFi connection cards from some of the IT companies in Korea and use that while traveiling.The KTX is so similar to the European trains in both speed and luxury (First Class sections).  If you're in Korea and have a day or two to burn, take a KTX excursion just for the experience.  It is truly a great ride.Please note there are two other classes of trains; the ITX (used to be called Saemaeul-ho) and Mugunghwa-ho.  To give you an idea of the travel time difference, the ITX from Gwang Ju to Yongsan Station takes about 4 hours or 1 hour more than the KTX.  I did not check the times for the Mugunghwa but I'd guess it would be another hour or more longer than the ITX.  There used to be another slower class train called the Tongil-ho, but it has been discontinued."
65,3.0,we use KTX from Busan to Seoul. the ticket is easy to purchase. the train is clean. the seat is pretty okay.. i think they need to make a space to store a big luggage... since we got difficult to keep our luggage because there is no space available.. our big luggage have to block a way so sometime people might difficult to pass..
66,5.0,"I love how the train is so clean and fast. Easy to book but could be hectic on weekends. If you are planning on going to popular places such as Busan, you definitely need to purchase ticket in advance. Also, if you are choosing window seat to enjoy the scene, you must make sure whether your seat has a window frame blocking the scene. There are few seats where the frame is completely blocking the view."
67,4.0,"Do not attempt to only have a 1 hour allowance time from Gimhae airport to KTX Busan station. Our schedule to take KTX is at 2230H, our plane landed in Busan at around 2100H. We realized that we may not make it at all, come on its friday, its drizzling -- so traffic is expected to be everywhere Busan. We ran to the taxi stand, took the first taxi we saw and told the ahjussi to go to ktx station hurriedly as we need to board the 2230H train. The ahjussi is so funny, kept telling us jokes in broken english, while i sweat in thoughts of paying another ticket if our train left us. We told him to hurry, but he warned us that its friday, and roads maybe busy. Lo and behold, as if all the gods are with us, we passed the 1st toll, then the tunnel, then the next toll in a jiffy. No traffic that night!!! The ahjussi is telling us that we are very lucky indeed!Arrived at the station, ran a km towards the ticket booth, the lady was fast enough to give us our ticket after i gave her the printed copy of the reservation, she showed us the way to the platform, and few seconds, we're inside the ktx train.We nearly missed the train by 2 minutes. It left late probably because it was the 2nd to the last trip to Seoul and they were waiting for few more passengers. But its too crazy. So do not attempt the 1 hour transit time from airport to train station.By the way, the wifi sucks. we got connected for only about15 minutes, afterwards, the connection was lost and the phone is directed to a korail page with korean characters (no english translation!!) and was not restored.If you'd like to buy water, do not ask the stewardess with carts full of goods, apparently they do not sell water in their carts and you have to go the end where the vending machine is located to buy your water.And you only get lucky once, going to Seoul, the train got the best of us when it was time to go back to Busan. We missed the train by 1 minute and this time I have to buy tickets again. Haven't checked yet if they refunded my payment on the reserved seat and just charged me with penalty or my money's all gone"
68,5.0,"From Busan, we went to Seoul via KTX. We bought our tickets 2 days ahead and we're lucky we did since seats and choice times sell out fast. Standard tickets cost 54,400 Won one-way (First class is around 80K Won). Standard seats are pretty comfortable with wide airline-like seats (only two in a row) and ample legroom.The train leaves on time so better get there early since it gets moving without much ceremonies. The ride is very comfortable and smooth. We were facing the opposite direction and we hardly noticed we were going backwards. Trains have WiFi but do seem have a time limit. Better check with someone who can read Korean if it does since the sign-in page is entirely in Hanggul.Travel time from Busan to Seoul (and vice versa) takes around a ""short"" 3 hours. Short since the ride is so comfortable it is sleep-inducing. An attendant with a cart sells refreshments and snacks in case you need it. There are restrooms inside the trains."
69,5.0,"After an awesome holiday in Donghae, we decided to take this train back into Seoul at 1130 pm.  It was a very smooth ride.  I feel right to sleep.  The seat recline alllllll the way back when I took it with Girlfriend, co-worker, and his Girlfriend. It does get a bit chilly so bring a light jacket! Have Fun!!"
70,5.0,"The KTX passes we purchased, which were a 10-day pass, came in very handy as we went from Seoul to Busan, Busan to Daegu, Daegu to Seoul, Seoul to Gwangju and Gwangju back to Seoul all within the 10 days. One thing to note is that bumping up to first class cost only 7000W if you already have the pass. It was worth it to us to bump to first class and have a larger and more relaxing seat. The economy seats were by no means uncomfortable or bad.  The trains were all very clean and quick. Its by far, the quickest way to get from coast to coast in Korea.  We saved a lot of money and hassle by having the KTX pass and look forward to coming back to Korea to ride the rails."
71,5.0,Took the KTX from seoul to singyeongju. The train is very clean and has spacious leg room. It is very comfortable and does not delay in schedule. The average speed was about 300 km/h. Great way to get around korea.
72,5.0,Great Option for travelers to explore around korea with affordable price and worth choosing to go to BUSAN (only 3 hours).
73,5.0,Is a fun filled ride from seoul to busan ! in less than 3 hrs. love the scenery on the way there n is fast traveling 300km/h. No delay and the train ride was stabled. comfy!
74,4.0,KR pass provides unlimited travel for foreigner for specific number of days. This save me a lot of money and time while travelling from Seoul to and from Busan. The train is very punctual and the interior is very clean and comfortable.
75,5.0,"beats the pants off the trains in the UK for service, price and speed."
76,4.0,"Went from Busan to Seoul and back, no problems at all! Left on time, arrived on time, comfortable. Machines to book tickets are quite picky with notes and often credit cards don't work, so I suggest booking at the counter if you can.Other than that it is everything a train service should be."
77,3.0,The KTX is a great way to get to other cities in Korea but I am not sure why it is listed as an attraction.  I've taken the KTX many times and it is always on time and convenient.
78,4.0,Wonderful connection from Gimpo to Seoul...except long walk in the underground from Gimpo Domestic Airport to board the express train with heavy luggage.  Heard that airport limousine bus was better without the long walk
79,4.0,"i try the busan-seoul trip :) u can find wify, food, clean toilet, nice seat inside the train :) only take 2 hours from busan to seoul.."
80,5.0,"The train is fast and convenient, if you wanna travel from north to south of korea, ktx is the best choice for you. The price of the ktx might a bit expensive, but if you are a foreigner, go purchase a KR pass(only for foreigner), got 1 day pass, 3 day pass, 5 day and so on. You can travel how many time unlimited within the limit, and the price of Kr pass is really cheap if compare with 1 way pass."
81,5.0,"Go to Busan or other terriories just easy and simple, but I recommend you should go online and check for your trip so you might get promotion ticket.The KTX provide you the food (selling), battery chager (fee), clean toilet , WiFI, and everything you need for a short trip."
82,4.0,"Mega fast, many locations it goes to now. pretty expensive, a train to busan is similar to the cost of airfare to busan..."
83,5.0,i love travelling in KTX. my first ride was last year (in May) from Busan to Seoul. and this year also the same from Busan to Seoul. the service is superb and on time.
84,5.0,"This one is fast.  You can go to the other end of Korea in 3 hours.  There are two other things I love about KTX:  (a) the Seoul KTX station has great restaurants on the upper floors and (b) you can download the KTX app from Apple Appstore and there is no need to physically carry the ticket -- your mobile phone is your ticket (btw, the app is so well made)."
85,4.0,"Took the KTX with my friend from Busan to Seoul last Feb 9.  Although there was a slight delay on arriving to Seoul for about 5 minutes, it was still fairly a comfortable ride for us.Refreshments were offered from time to time so if in case we get hungry, then we can just buy from the crew.All in all, we would not hesitate to take this train again given that the normal 6 hours or more ride from Busan to Seoul became 3 hours only."
86,4.0,"On time, comfortable, interesting information about speed etc.. Goes up to 400k/h.."
87,5.0,"I took KTX from Seoul-Busan-Seoul in Dec 2011. The KTX arrives and departs at Seoul Station in Seoul. It costs around 42,000-45,000 Won for each trip. And it takes 3 hours each trip. Very comfy. I has bicycle storage and if you have big luggage you can store it near the entrance/exit door. They sell snacks/drinks/meals during the trip. Don't worry if you don't have time buying food or drink before departing.Note that the KTX is very on time. The train leaves at exact time as schedule unless there's something major going on."
88,4.0,"Not enough space to put bulky luggages. KTX leave on time so don't be late. You can change the timing of the train tickets if you arrive too early at the station. Although it's pricy, it's worth it as it save alot of time. You can reserve the tickets online, and the credit card will only be charged when the tickets are issued in Korea. So you can reserve and cancel the online reservation anytime. Train is very clean and quiet. You can ask for middle seat (seat for 4 pax) or sear for 2 pax (regular seat)"
89,4.0,We rode the KTX from Busan to Seoul and vice versa. Its very comfortable. They have discounted rate for those in tight budget. Its very accessible and the train is very clean.
