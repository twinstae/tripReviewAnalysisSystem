1,5.0,"I love this museum.  Located at the front steps of Gyeonghui Gung Palace, the Seoul Museum of History designed by Mies van der Rohe protege Joung Song Kimm is an airy and well laid out museum.  Most important of all the place is free to everyone.  Inside the museum, you can see exhibitions of the life of Seoulites dating from the 15th c. to the Korean War to the post war development era to now.  Extensive and beautiful models of the city in different sizes abound the museum.  An intricate wooden model of Gwanhwamun Square leading up to Gyeongbok Gung Palace with the full royal entourage is massive and immensely detailed.  A full complement of period paintings depicting the urbanscape surrounds the room which is about a ballroom in scale.  An even more impressive model of the city depicts modern Seoul that you walk around and on via a glass floor.  The model is massive.  From Gimpo Airport to the 100 story Lotte Hotel in Jamsil, you can see the entire city in front of you as if n an airplane. I would guess the model is about a third the size of a football field.  Impressive.Further exhibitions show the fast development of Seoulite's life from the war to the present.  It is all fascinating stuff.The museum is sized just right so you don't feel overwhelmed.  Kids and adults love all the models of the city displayed throughout the museum.  All in all, the museum is a very engaging place full of interactive diplays and fully interesting exhibitions for the whole family."

The museum is a great place to find out interesting details about Seoulâ€™s history and is definitely worth visiting."

4,5.0,"This is the first stop the Seoul guide took us.  First room we stepped on was a model map of Seoul under the glass that we walked on.  It was cool!  Dark with lights like night view.  We learned a lot from him and this place.  The Museum presents the story of Seoul from the prehistoric era to modern time. The main exhibit halls are on the 3rd floor which is divided into 4 sections; Seoul, the Capital of Joseon, People's Life in Seoul, Culture of Seoul, and Development of the Seoul City.  It also has a nice garden."

9,4.0,"This museum wasn't on my list of attractions that I wanted to visit, but when it started raining during our tour our private guide suggested we stop by this museum and I'm very glad we did.  We all enjoyed seeing the large model of historic Seoul and the really huge model of modern Seoul (it fills up an entire large room) is really fun and helps give you a better feeling for the layout of this large city that is surrounded my mountains."

11,5.0,"Seoul needed a Korean history museum, and this is an excellent addition to an excellent selection of museums.  Good location too, and not too big.  Definitely worth a visit when you are visiting Kyongbok Palace."
12,4.0,"Its a pretty unique museum, has the entire model buildings of the city of Seoul, the world's second largest metropolitan city in the world! So it was pretty cool. It had a lot of hands on stuff for the kids upstairs, and a nice outdoor park too. But the real beauty of this place is the fact that it is FREEE!!!! Free admission. Only the restaurant there kinda stinks, but its best to go for the museum experience, and witness what this city has been through in history."
13,4.0,We enjoyed our two hours in this museum. There are interactive stations for the children to try out. The 3D map of Seoul on the 3rd floor is amazing. I just wish there was more information in English and not just Korean. WOuld recommend this on a rainy day and with children.
14,5.0,"This museum is a 10 minute walk from the Museum of Contemporary History, located in a lovely parkland in the midst of busy Seoul.  Take a walk around the building and enjoy the neighboring palace, too!  The permanent and temporary exhibits share the history and development of this very modern city.  I always find it inconceivable when I see the pre-War photos and see what is in Seoul now.  The coffee shop is a nice retreat."
