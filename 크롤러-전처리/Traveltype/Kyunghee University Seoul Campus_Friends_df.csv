There are two floors, first floor bigger with a stage in the front middle, second floor half size the first floor. Toilets are in each side of hall....left for ladys and right for gents. Parking space outside quit big enough for tens of buses."

The architecture for two of the buildings were impressive. Overall, the campus is ok. I think visiting during Spring will be better since you can look at cherry blossoms as well."
