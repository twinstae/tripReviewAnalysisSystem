0,1.0,"Every store in the male section is hawking for customers. They are onto you the moment you step off the escalator. Prices are definitely way above what you can get at other areas like hongdae shopping street. I saw the same top costing 10000 Won at hongdae but the seller quoted me 38000 won at migliore. by the way, almost all items do not have price tags there so be wary. Materials also aren't of good quality to fit the prices - even after you factor in a discount of about 20-30%. They'll ask you to give them a price. But it doesnt matter because the original price is already marked up way above what you can get outside. It's essentially another trick up their sleeves. Know your materials and do not fall to pressure. Otherwise, shop at other areas like myeongdong, Sinchon or hongdae where they are a lot friendlier and they have prices which you can see."

2,1.0,"The sellers act like gang. When you look around the place, they keep bothering you to look at it and buy it.Also the price was way higher than my expectation. When I mentioned that is too expensive, (this is kind of routine) they ask me back ""how much you expected?"" no matter how much you mentioned, they said they cannot offer that price. When I gave up to buy it, they talked to my back.This was not just one place. I experienced every single place.I strongly recommended (warned) you. Don't go this place. This will ruin your mood and image of Korea."
3,1.0,"I went to here with my friends and most of the sellers on 4th floor who are selling men's clothes were not nice at all. We nicely asked the price of the goods, and after we were told the price, we said it was too expensive. They asked back, how much do we want, and after we gave our number, they responded rudely and said ""don't come back again."" They also speak in Korean to other sellers which I believe talking something about us. It's just very funny for us, if they are not ready to be bargained, then don't ask us to bargain.I'd prefer to shop at other places but not this 4th floor."
4,4.0,"The first thing that came to mind in the layout and products was Platinum Mall in Bangkok, but this is a scaled down version and prices aren't as cheap as in BKK (natch). Still a nice mall to see wholesale priced clothes (more fashionable) and shoes (sneakers galore) and accessories. Was looking for glitzy sneakers but couldn't find anything with the right look and price. Picked up a couple of accessories but then .... wasn't really in a shopping mood! A good mall to visit especially since stuff was cheaper than in Doota Mall next door."
5,3.0,"There are a lot of small shops in a big one, no prices are written, it's the saler that tells you the price. Generally it's quite expensive , but here is the ""game"" : negociation, if you manage it well you can have it for 25% of the first price announced ! (A saler wanted to sell me a shirt for 48 000 won, I got it for 20 000).A good experience to do, but not for me, I prefer to see stable prices."
6,3.0,"I always heard of must visit dongdaemun when u r in Seoul. Varities of cheap and affordable clothes.. Varities of clothes is true, but not cheap.. And the size is very limited"
7,5.0,"OMG despite what people say, (overpriced cheap stuffs etc.), I love the place! For me, all the garments that i bought there were within reasonable price. I stayed at the mall from midnight until 4am. The outside of the mall was still packed with people (koreans mostly) although it was 4am. The coffeebeans was still opened. Taxis everywhere. Or if you don't want to take a cab, wait until the first train at 5.30am. I went there on a Saturday night."
8,4.0,Very large building that contains many shops. You can enjoy here for almost the whole day to go through all the shops inside. There are some coffee shops and food shops for you to rest & relax your legs before continue shopping.
9,3.0,"One of a few off the open-late malls in dongdaemun, it can be worth the visit if you know exactly what you want.  Be careful because prices are not always cheap (do try to negotiate a lower price) and you may end up buying something for more than a shop on the street.  However, with that said, there are some things you may not be able to see on the streets, so probably make your rounds in the other shopping areas before heading to Migliore (when all the other shops are closed). Also, some shops will give you a discount of thousand won or so, if you pay cash, so make sure to ask!  It's worth a try!"
10,2.0,"A lot of hype about not much. There are floors and floors of clothes, clothes, clothes and some of the shop owners won't let you try on the clothes, so no point! If you must tick the box, pop in and out and then go to Dongdaemun traditional Market for real bargains, but get there early as this local market shuts at 6pm and after that, only the malls are open."
11,3.0,"Prices are competitive and no bargaining allowed as they are all fixed rates. Fashion not as up market but if you look closer, you may find some gems!"
12,4.0,"The shopping here is good and there's definitely a variety. However, i wouldn't say the stuffs here are cheap for students like me. The shopping is mainly catered for women with only the top floor being a guy's zone. Its definitely a place with many small shops but the orientation of the shops makes it hard for one to keep track where one is going. By the time we finished the first floor, we were getting  lazy to shop the upper floors. hence you can see the reduction in number of people falling with each increasing floors. Maybe it's best to check out other places like gangnam underground shopping before heading here to get the best value for your apparels!"
13,3.0,"Bought myself a pair of shoes, 2 shirts and some souvenirs here. Reasonably priced items and I love the shoes. The clothes are trendy and current. Surely will come again if I ever set my foot here next time."
14,3.0,"Shop till you drop. It opens from 10 am - 5am (next day)!!! Midnight shopping!You can find loads of fashion apparels. Basement sells baby/toddlers wear. Mid level sells women apparels. Upper level sells men apparels, shoes, bags, accessories.When you come to the men apparels level. You'll find those seller very aggressive yet friendly.. They will greet you ask where you from. And they can speak basic english/mandarin/japanese. You can bargain with them if you purchase more. Its expensive though but I love this place very much. Come here to have a feel of it."
