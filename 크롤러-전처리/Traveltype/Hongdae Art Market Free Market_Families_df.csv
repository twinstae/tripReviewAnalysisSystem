It is an open area where artists get the chance to showcase their talents thru stuff like jewelries, potteries, leather goods, clothes, postcards, paintings, etc. All designs are handmade. You can even have your portraits made while waiting. My 2 girls and I enjoyed walking around and appreciating the talents of the artists who participated in the free market. We bought quite a handful of products and we loved them. Some stalls even accept credit cards. Try and visit this place when you are in Seoul."

4,5.0,"Very vibrant and lots of young people around. Lots of street shops selling affordable ladies clothings, cosmetics and socks. Better than Myeongdong in my opinion. If you have time to only visit Myeongdong or Hongdae, I will say visit Hongdae!"
5,5.0,"The free market doesn’t operate in Dec.  Instead I went to the shopping street in Hongdae.What a vibe!  Youngsters are everyone and all the stalls are playing fun music.  Makes me feel like dancing to the beat.  Some shoppers even brought exotic pets (raccoons?) and attracted a small crowd.We visited a small shop where you can try your luck “fishing” out a toy from the machine.  Lots of people carried off their prizes (soft toys) and we thought it would be easy.  Sorry, no luck.  Will try again next time."

7,5.0,"Lots of things to do and shop.  Mainly more stalls selling fashion items, bits and pieces. Young and trendy place with a.Uni nearby. Like Myeongdong without the beauty stuff."
8,4.0,"A very ""happening"" place filled with young people. There are lots of stuff to shop and eat also. The food street has very wide range of restaurant, cafe and food street stall that we can feast."
9,5.0,"I knew this place will be crowded but was pleasantly surprised to see so many locals at weekend. Teens and youngsters that comb the street. There must be a sale for limited edition LIne bear going on. I saw lots of people carrying that item. Highly recommend to come and walk the street and spent at least 3 hours here. Mapo has the best BBQ beef in local Korean style.  cafe hopping, amusement stores, fashion shops and ice creams."
10,5.0,"Went to Hongdae last weekend for the first time. Had a great time. The streets are alive like many other areas in Seoul. This place though has a different feel. There are students and others performing dances, singing, playing instruments and rapping all over. There are great places to eat cheaply and the air is electric. I see why many people have begun to migrate to this place. I highly recommend this location for fun."
11,3.0,We visited the free market on Sat afternoon but it was rather dissapointing due to the small number of stalls. Some of the handcrafted items looked interesting but rather expensive. There are quite a few stalls doing caricature. You may want to just take a quick stroll if you are headed to spend the evening at hongdae.

13,4.0,I'm a lover of arts and crafts and local people making and sharing their art. There are lots of handmade arts and crafts hear you're looking for a handbag or a necklace this is the place and it's reasonably priced.  It's really great because family can come here and enjoy interesting Korean artwork.
14,5.0,This is probably the most energetic party of the city. A maze of restaurants and shops makes for a wonderfully lazy walk. Stop by the bars and ice cream shops. Make sure to bargain cause the prices quoted aren't the final prices.
