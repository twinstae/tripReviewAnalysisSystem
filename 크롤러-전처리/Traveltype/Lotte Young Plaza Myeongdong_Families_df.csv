I should have been more cautious, as I could have checked on my credit card application right after. And of course no ticket payment which was supposed to be in the bag. So no way for me to get my money back. I feel a bit disgusted by this experience, because I’m convinced it happened because I’m a foreigner."

We started from basement where SUM was but were not very encouraged to continue to find out more. We went back to Namdaemun which was more variety, reasonably priced and full of surprises and localities too."
4,4.0,"This plaza/building is just right next to the Lotte Department Store so personally I would prefer to go to the Lotte Department store as Lotte Young Plaza is just a smaller version, with smaller clothing stores and such. HOWEVER FOR KPOP FANS: there is a smtown when you go to the bottom levels and the first 2 levels have really cute cosmetic stores, trinket stores and places like the Line store (this is one of the reasons I went there). Additionally, I saw some BTS merch on one of the higher levels next to the bubble tea shop. I am not sure if this is still available, but if you go to the Lotte Department Store and get a catalogue from one of the info desks/staff, you may go to the bubble tea shop in Lotte Young Plaza and use a coupon from the catalogue to get free bubble tea. Again, I found out about this deal around Christmas time so I am not sure its valid. Those are the main reasons I went to Lotte Young Plaza.So overall, I believe that for the kpop fans and people who like cute things like Line, and for people who like bubble tea, its worth going to the Lotte Young Plaza. It is not a ""must go"" destination however as there are clothing stores elsewhere as well."
