0,4.0,"Pretty much the dead centre of Seoul,  a huge square ringed by massive buildings and Seoul City Hall. It's got a nice green area in the middle with fountains and a colourful Seoul sign. Beautifully lit at night. It's a busy bustling place by day"
1,4.0,I chanced upon this place on my way to Deoksugung Palace. This open space oval-shaped grass square in front of Seoul City Hall is used as a place to hold various events and cultural festivals. It is a well-known place where tens of thousands of Korean soccer fans gather here to cheer their team during the 2002 World Cup Games.
2,3.0,"Seoul Plaza is a big stretch of land in front of the city hall and the Seoul Metropolitan Library. Before coming here, the photos I saw of the plaza showed much grass in the area. When I arrived, nothing but dirt appeared in the vast expanse, which was ringed by colorful potted flowers. Children played in the space and adults strolled. There were no signs of protests, which often occur here.But when I passed by two days later,  tents had been set up throughout the plaza for a kimchi festival. No fan of salted and fermented vegetables, I vowed not to return for the celebration. But I did come across a colorful photo of chefs preparing kimchi here in my local newspaper after I returned to the United States. It is impossible to miss the plaza when visiting the library or city hall. But I see no reason to seek it out unless a special event of interest is scheduled there."
3,3.0,"I stayed at the Plaza hotel which is just across the road from the Seoul Plaza - a place apparently popular with protesters and demonstrators. During the week that I was in Seoul there were no massive demonstrations apart from a group of well behaved taxi drivers protesting about competition similar to Uber. Police presence was always in the background - on one morning I saw quite a few police busses parked up in a side street presumably with occupants waiting to quell any trouble. There isn't really much of note here. There is the photogenic ""I.SEOUL.U sign. I didn't really get the true meaning (I don't think that I'm the only one) so I looked it up. ""According to the city, the concept here is intended to suggest that Seoul is a place where two individuals can co-exist"". So now we know. Any the wiser?Of course the other very recent addition is the huge picture of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in visiting a crater lake atop a Mount Paektu - a volcano considered sacred in North Korea."
4,5.0,"If you go near this park, you should check it out. It's on a great location near Gyeongbokgung Palace and King Sejong statue. There are big ""I SEOUL U"" letters which are popular for taking pictures with."
5,4.0,"Seoul Plaza is an activity location in one of the most central places of the city. Especially during warm seasons, almost each day it is possible to see something interesting in this location. Seoul Plaza is very close to many hotels and restaurants, as well as to main tourist attraction places. It is worth checking the activities here during Seoul visit."
6,5.0,"Right in City Hall, there are protests here most of the time. Temples around, great place to take pictures"
7,4.0,"The Plaza itself is nothing special, what makes this place is there is always something going on. Markets, shows, exhibitions. If you are around drop in and see what is going on today."
8,3.0,"The area is quite big which located in front of Seoul City Hall. You can visit easily by subway and get off at City Hall station. Surrounded with Seoul City Hall, Seoul Metropolitan Library, Deoksugung (Palace) and much more. But... it's always crowded by many people who set up the events/ activities. In the winter, this lawn will be transformed to be ice skate rink."
9,3.0,"C1 ( 2016.09.29 ) This lawn was located at the front of Seoul City Hall. I knows sometimes events was held this area, but when I visited, there was nothing. So there was just lawn to me. The grass was in good hands"
