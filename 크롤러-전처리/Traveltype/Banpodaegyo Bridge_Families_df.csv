3,3.0,"We travelled a fair distance to get to Banpo bridge expecting to see a water and lights spectacular. It was just OK - not worth travelling over an hour just to see this. If you have seen spectacular lights on water in Dubai, Vegas or Singapore, you'll be disappointed with this. That said, there is a great walking area and outdoor park near the bridge. The other thing to bear in mind is that this is a night only show so don't turn up during the day."

5,2.0,We dedicated our evening to make a long trip during cold evening to see the remarkable water and light show from the bridge faced with the fact theres no show for today!   Based on the information from local cafe staff within the area. They will resume the warerfall and light
6,4.0,"Its free, its a good location (right by the riverside), get a chilled beer and spend time - whats not to like about it.  Tips: best seen when its dark (8 or even later), buy chilled beer from the convenience store around the park area, if coming by bus/taxi avoid weekends (road"
7,1.0,"Went on a weeknight and it wasn't as spectacular and as colorful as the photos on google. I wouldn't recommend coming here only for the purpose of seeing the fountain show, but if you happen to be in the area, might as well make a stop to see the show. "
8,4.0,Interesting rainbow moonlight show but only one side of the bridge because it was a weeknight.  The area next to banpo was nice to walk with  illuminated buildings. It's called Sebit floating islands. There are some shops and  coffee place inside.
9,3.0,"This was an enjoyable evening in a park along the river.  They pipe music through speakers, the water undulates through colored lights.  For me it was okay but I'm comparing them to the Fountains at the Bellagio in Vegas and Niagara Falls.  My niece had seen neither and really"
10,4.0,"It takes around 10-15 mins walk from Express Bus Terminal Station to this. It is better if we get out from Exit No. 4 of Gangnam Underground Shopping Mall.It is quite cold at nigh. However, there is a musical performance nearby, so I can enjoy the view together with listening to music."
11,3.0,"It's around 20 minutes walking from the closest subway st.but i have to say,the road to this bridge is nice.the rainbow fountain will be much beautiful if you see it from higher place.if you want to take beautiful pic of this fountain,you have to bring your DSLR.."
12,3.0,"Walked down to the Bampo bridge from Iaetwon one night to check out the floating islands and the bridge water show. It was something different to see. It's cool, but not something I'd go out of my way to see. Definetly a cool stop if you're that part of town at that time of night or hanging out in the park along the river."
13,3.0,"From what I read, I really wanted to see this bridge and  watch the water / light/ music show at night.   well, that was really disappointing.  The music is not loud enough and there is a constant whine coming out of the speakers.  The water just sprays and it's nothing really special, so don't feel bad if you can't fit this in.  Actually what was prettier, was just seeing the view of the city from across the river.  There are some nice restaurants over there  and it's peaceful and pretty.  I'm glad we saw that, just don't get too excited about seeing the water/music show.  most people were not paying attention to it."
14,4.0,"It's a tourist attraction and local hang out place. I saw many local set up a tent, bring their own food and enjoying the precious moment with their families. It warms my heart despite the weather was quite cold. Plus point: you can rent a bicycle and cycle within the area, feel the breezing wind touches your face."
