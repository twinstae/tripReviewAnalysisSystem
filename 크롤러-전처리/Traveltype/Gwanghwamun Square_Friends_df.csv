0,3.0,Not much to do here other than see the statues. I presume they have events here throughout the year. Seems to be popular with tourists. In a great area as there are lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Good to visit after the palace as it‚Äôs just outside.

3,5.0,"My friend and I walked from our place going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, before arriving you will pass by first at this beautiful and historical square. The square is heavily guarded.  The statue of King Sejong the Great is located in the middle of the square. For us, we felt it was an additional free treat, who did not expect to pass by in this place before reaching the palace. This site offer another glimpse of the colorful history of South Korea. The statue is really huge and attract tourists. Worth for photo opportunity."

It is a perfect place to give yourself a walk around and admire the beauty of the the other statue located in the site. definitely a must see place when you visiting South Korea.
8,4.0,"Viewing this square is more about the people and the politics that the statues in the square. Whilst the statues themselves might be of interest to a historian, around the square you will see people protesting and campaigning for various things. It's worth taking a local who will tell you what's going on with the current state of (very interesting) affairs in South Korea and it's relation with the rest of the world."
9,4.0,"This is a nice attraction if you're interested in walking from the Gyeongbokgung Palace down towards City Hall or other city attractions. It's a beautiful space to see some monuments, mini festivals, all with the mountains in the background."
10,5.0,"There are various ways to get to this place. The nearest would be Gwanghwamun Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 1, 2 & 8. It is just opposite Gyeongbokgung and near one part of the Cheonggyecheon stream so you can cover a few places within a day. There's also a King Sejong museum which I didn't get to visit due to the timing. There's a Sunday flea market (information accurate as of 2016) at the square too, can check it out if you pop by on a Sunday."

12,4.0,This is just outside the Gyeonbokgung Palace. The monuments are really nice. If you're lucky you will see a flea market where at one stall Hanbok is sold. So rather rent why not buy the entire get up. That would be a nice souvenir!!
13,4.0,"As it is the heart of the Seoul City, various of events took place in the plaza. If you are interested in what is happening in Korea or Seoul, come to this place in the weekend as several events took place in different part of the city when I was visiting on Saturday afternoon.

17,4.0,Many police in here. A large square near gyeongbokgung palace. So u can go there with the same time.
18,5.0,I went to the Square after going to the Gate. This is a nice place to learn about Korea's history and also see the beautiful statues and the unobscured blue skyline. There are many people moseying about and it's nice to catch bits and pieces of the oral history on top of reading the plaques.

20,3.0,"Since the US Embassy is beside this place, there were a lot of security details in place. On top of that, at the Gwanghwamun subway end, there were a lot of tents for the protesters against the current Korean President. Not much to see for me on our way to Kyodo Bookstore (the biggest bookstore in Seoul)."
21,4.0,"Learn more about the local culture by visiting this area. Clean area. When I visited, there were protesters in the area but it was ok (peaceful one)."
22,5.0,"Gwanghwamun Square is a good place to visit, to understand some history of South Korea. You can also take great pictures with the statue. It is also near the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Cheonggyecheon Stream as well as Bukchon Village so you can plan all these places in a single day. It is also accessible via metro (alight at Gwanghwamun station)"
23,4.0,Went over to Gwanghwamun Square for a short sight-seeing. There was a fair with stalls selling clothes and food around it during my visit. A good spot for photography. It was great to see historic architectures among tall skyscrapers. A good way to preserve history.
24,4.0,"My hotel was near this area and we took strolls around this area very frequently. I love the atmosphere and the scenery at night is pretty gorgeous. You have Gyeongbukgung at the end of it and both sides are flanked by traffic with tall financial buildings around ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty surreal and makes for very nice photographs. It‚Äôs also a stone‚Äôs throw from many eateries/other nice to visit places like Samcheongdong, Seochon and cheonggyecheon stream."
25,3.0,This square is not a big attraction on its own but in combination with the palace then its ok to visit.i suggest doing this route as a day trip.Gwanghwamun Square - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream
26,4.0,I spent only a few mins here to have a look at the statues there and took a few photos. Gwanghwamun Square is very near to Gwanghwamun Gate which is the entrance to Gyeongbokgung.

Following is my route for the visit (but this route required a lot of walking):Anguk Subway Station - Bukchon Hanok Village - Blue House - Gyeongbokgung (enter via gate near Blue House) - Gwanghwamun Gate (Guard changing ceremony) - Gwanghwamun Square - Gwanghwamun Subway Station

33,5.0,"The square itself is worth the visit, with statues of the King and the Admiral and in sight of Gyeongbokgung Palace (5 minute walk away). Lots of people around, taking pictures, having a coffee, etc. Great views!Highly recommend that you go underground to the free museum/exhibit, which you can get to from the backside of the statue of King Sejong (stairs and elevator available). At the desk they can provide you with a free audio guide and it takes 30-45 minutes to do the whole thing. I learned so much history about Korea, from the development of the alphabet and music to the Imjin war(Japanese aggression in the 1400s) and development of the Navy. We're all history buffs, so we really enjoyed this uncrowded little treasure."
34,4.0,Love the architecture surrounding the area and you can take a photo with the great King Sejong's humongous statue.
35,4.0,"Nothing amazing on its own but close to the Palace gate so since you'll be in the area anyway, have a look"
36,4.0,"A stroll from the palace is a must. Further down, there is the upper part of the Water Reclamation Centers that was turned into eco-friendly park."
37,5.0,This area is nice and picturesque. What's interesting is there is an underground museum in this area.
38,3.0,"Just an average square, with a landmark statue. Sometimes there is concert or activity held here. On the opposite street, there are a lot of cafe to hang around."
39,5.0,The square was alive with activity the day we visited but we were still able to appreciate the layout of the square to take advantage of the palace and mountains beyond creating great depth. Having the many embassies bordering it also gives it an air of importance.
40,5.0,"We walked from city hall station to the palace through here. It quite nice architecture, very Seoul."
41,5.0,This was great you have the American & Korean Embessy  on opposite sides of the street. Down underground you have this great museum under this statue.
42,4.0,"This is an excellent place to go solo, with friends or family. I recommend summer. The you can go wading in the plaza wading pool. Lots of sights  to see, and restaurants to check out."
43,5.0,"One of my favorite parts of the city. Not only does it provide a beautiful view of the main palace on nice days, but it's also a very open and spacious area which is nice in such a cramped city like Seoul.There is always a festival or market going on here. The American embassy is located at the square a well.If you would like to try on Korea Hanboks, during the day a tourist stall is set up near  the King Sejong statue that allows tourists to take pictures in Hanboks.During the warm months a fountain show can be seen at the square where children can also play in the water throughout the day. The fountains also light up at night time.Also located near by City Hall and the Indsadong area.A must see in Seoul."
44,4.0,"If you're visiting Gyeongbokgung (which basically a must visit for travellers coming to Seoul), you must have visited Gwanghwamun because it is right in front of Gyeongbokgung main gate. All you have to do is crossing the street and you are at Gwanghwamun Square! There are some things that you might see in Gwanghwamun. There are a kind of water stream with some Korea's history in it. You may also see Kim Se Jong statue (he is hangul founding father, korean alphabet). The view is quite amazing with mount background. Even it's related much to Korean's history, we can learn quite a bit about it because in Gwanghwamun Square, they presents it in a very nice way!"
45,4.0,I usually pass by to get to Kyobo library. Nice place to stop by if you are traveling. Several palaces are close from here.
46,4.0,"Near the center of Seoul, this place is very active and has a lot of cultural importance. When we were here, there was an exhibition of all the flags of the countries who fought in the Corean War. Great contrast with the statues."
47,4.0,"Gwanghwamun square is the main attraction place in town. U cannot miss this spot.  There's a lot to see here from majestic statue of king sejong, sewol memorial (ferry tragedy), art and culture and more. Take a long walk, buy a snack and snap a pics."
48,4.0,"This place is right in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace. You can walk through this place until Cheonggyecheon Stream. When I was visit this place, there were some event from a lot of countries sell their food, with a stage in the middle. You can chill around here and enjoy the town."
49,4.0,"It reminds me of Tiananmen Square in Beijing with historical monuments and statues. While Tiananmen Square boasts of the grand and majestic Forbidden City, Gwanghwamun Square proudly presents Gyeongbokgung Palace.in the scenic backdrop of Mount Bugaksan.  Gwanghwamun Square is, however, comparatively smaller, more relaxed, more modern, more commercialized and less crowded than Tiananmen Square. Although the US Embassy is just located in close proximity to the Square, the atmosphere here is less tense than that at Tiananmen Square. At Tiananmen Square, you see police patrol vehicles stationed right in the middle of the Square with armed military personnel on tight surveillance and standby watch for any suspicious activities.The two prominent artistic statues at Gwanghwamun Square: King Sejong and Admiral Yi Shun-sin blend harmoniously with the lustrous and dynamic surrounding and the historical palace at the other far end. King Sejong established the Korean alphabet (Hanjul) and was well remembered as the pioneer who laid the foundation for Korean culture and language. Admiral Yi Shun-sin defeated the Japanese invaders in a naval battle and safeguard the territorial integrity of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Without their great achievements, the vibrant and dynamic Korean culture would not have been in existent among one of the distinct and unique cultures in the world. The museum beneath the statues showcased the many magnificent artifacts during the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty. After wandering around the Square and taking many photos of the two statues, we proceeded to witness the guards changing ceremony at Gwanghwamun Square. The Palace Guards were attired in colorful Korean traditional costume and they walked in elegance with an air of arrogance and pride. After the ceremony, we walked to Cheonggyecheon Stream and Cheonggye Plaza. Skyscrapers and commercial buildings dominated the skyline and it was like the City Hall and Orchard Road of Singapore with many well attired office workers streaming the area. From here, it was also a short distance walk to Myeongdong.   I would say Gwanghwamun Square is a historical icon of modern Seoul. I would say that you had not been to Seoul if you have not visited Gwanghwamun Square."
