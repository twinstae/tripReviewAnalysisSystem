0,5.0,"My husband and I frequently walk and picnic at this park and have always had pleasant experiences. There are lots of nicely maintained walking paths, outdoor sculpture and plantings to enjoy, picnic areas, and a generally peaceful atmosphere. It is not often crowded. We had a maternity photo shoot done here during the cherry blossom bloom time in Seoul and were extremely pleased with them. This is a great, underrated park to see the cherry blossoms and other beautiful trees."
