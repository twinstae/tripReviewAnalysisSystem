0,2.0,It’s a nice Palace but having been to a few now in Korea it’s a little tiring. If this is your first Palace then this is a great start but you’ll soon see that all palaces in Korea have the exact same layout and every building has the exact same designs and colours.
1,5.0,"Visited Changdeokgung palace. Changdeokgung Palace is also known as Donggwol, the Eastern Palace, because of its location to the east of Gyeongbokgung Palace.Was amazed and thrilled of how the Joseon Dynasty was ruled. They preserve the architecture of the building pretty well. Took some awesome pictures of Injeongjeon & Daejajeon. Love the story behind how the king ruled his ministry and kingdom."
2,4.0,"This palace also has an extension which is called the secret garden. There is an additional fee of 5000 won to enter the secret garden, which has buildings set amidst trees and landscaping. The palace complex is vast and the guided tour took a lot of time. The guide was excellent in explaining the history and took pains to point out minute details of the palace."
3,5.0,"Changdeokgung is by far my favorite palace in Seoul due to the secret garden... if you are visiting it, I recommend you take the secret garden tour as well.. totally worth it!"
4,5.0,À Seoul must-goDo not forget to check the time of the changing of the Gate’s guards. Think about coming in advance!You can also try to wear a rented hanbok(traditional clothes). That is an unforgettable experience!
5,4.0,We had a good time visiting this place. We came on weekend and had many locals dressed with traditional clothes. Plenty to do for 2-3 hours.
6,4.0,"Visited this Palace first & picked up a free guide outside the Palace. These are students that are practicing their languages & are very helpful & friendly. They wear orange tops & can be found outside the entrance area. They give an excellent overview without going into too much depth.The Palace architecture is lovely, but the buildings contain very little themselves.Tickets can be purchased to access the secret garden too. This does require an official guide & your given your tour start time. The guide is very helpful & informative & does go into lots more detail. As you meander through the gardens, mainly trees, there are pavilions & water feature areas. The walk/tour does have steeper areas.Both are worth a visit it you want a feel for Royal living"
7,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace has a timeless beauty that will make you visit again and again. It is no wonder why the ancient kings and royalties preferred here than the main palace. We are lucky to be in time for the 1030am guided tour into the palace's secret garden, a huge garden with Instagram worthy pavilion. The best pavilion is the one with the mini rice paddy field!"
8,4.0,I think many people do not realise that if you visit at either 10 am or 2pm you can see the changing of the guards. If you are visiting it makes sense to see this.The Palace is quite substantial and well maintained. Interesting to watch all the folks dressed in traditional style Korean outfits taking photos!A nice few hours and right next to the Buchan Hanok village.
9,3.0,"It was our first day in Seoul, and having our small rented apartment nearby and it was a free entry day, it was our first visit!If I say it  set the tone for similar visits over our 4 days in Seoul , I would not say we were greatly impressed!  The great halls  are quite impressive in themselves ( although most parts are later reconstructions resulting from hostile events in Japanese/Korean history! However , overall, the site seems to lack any coherence to help the visitor to understand the history of the place! There is very little access INTO any of these buildings and rather too many notices       "" Do not step!"" A big  minus point in this and seemingly most of the central Seoul historic sites is the use of SAND on most of the pathways in the complex! Seoul seems to be quite a windy city , even when summer temperatures top 35 degrees, everything is covered in a thin layer sand , including visitors! We did pay for a guided tour of the Secret Garden, really not a greatly rewarding experience ( even if you could understand the guide's English ) but you're not allowed to go around except on a tour?"
10,5.0,"The Changeokgungn Palace s beautiful and it is big! In the center of the city, it’s gardens and paths are peaceful. It was quite hot the day we visited, but shade was abundant and the various buildings were very interesting. Signs were helpful to gain insights and understanding. We enjoyed our 2 hour stroll among the sights and gardens. It is well worth the visit."
11,5.0,Can recommend .Make sure you bring water in summer .very big palace .some palaces will look the same .important to us was that we allowed enough time to sit down and take it in .
12,3.0,"Very stage managed parade for changing of the guards, very bright and colourful costumes.Museum on site"
13,5.0,"What made this palace stand out was the excellent English-language tour guide who filled out time there with colorful stories of the previous residents of this palace.  We highly recommend that you join one of the frequent tours (including with admission).  It will make the place come alive, instead of being just another palace.  We did not go on to tour the gardens, but were very happy with what we learned on just the palace tour.  Do not miss this when you're in Seoul!"
14,5.0,"The architecture and history here are engrossing.  However, the Secret Garden Tour is the highlight, worth the additional entry fee.  Available in English."
15,5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous, I loved it, it is big and wide, a lot of things to see and walk. Make sure to bring water and wear comfortable shoes. Ideal for families, couples, groups or solo travelers."
16,3.0,My wife wanted to visit here and thus we did lol. It was okay - saw the changing of the guard and we walked around the grounds for an hour or so. I feel that once you have seen one Korean palace... you have seen them all. My better half enjoyed it...
17,3.0,"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day."
18,5.0,This is a group of Palaces and Temples on large grounds.  Not far from Gyeonghbokgung.  There is a separate entrance and fee for the Gardens.
19,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of Korea's ""Five Grand Palaces'.  It is definitely worth a visit.  To explore the whole complex takes several hours, but a shorter visit is still very worthwhile.  This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia.  As at other palaces in Sepul, there are many locals in traditional clothes.  Although not required, it is best to have a guide at this site.."
20,5.0,A portion of palace grounds is limited to a daily quota of visitors and only accompanied by palace guide.  This is the Secret Garden which was the recreational forest of the palace.  About an hour the tour involves fair amount of walking and changes of elevation.
21,4.0,"Both the buildings and grounds of this palace are delightful -- and it is easily accessible being just a couple of blocks from the Anguk (Line 3, Exit 3) metro stop. For admission to the Secret Garden, one muist have a reservation -- but for seniors (65+), entrance to the palace is free of charge."
22,5.0,This is one of the most visually beautiful palaces to visit in Seoul. Not only are the structure stunning from the outside with their beautifully painted motifs but the insides are stunning as well including some interesting furnished pieces. Make sure you book tickets for the secret garden ahead of time as it can only be done via a guided tour. It was the highlight of our visit. It is nice to visit via tour as there are less people making the experience more relaxed and it’s easier to take photos with no one in them.
23,3.0,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.
24,5.0,"Missed the flowers in season, but still a huge and great palace to visit. Lots of space and greenery. You can pay and go into the secret garden but the next tours were booked so we didn’t bother waiting hours"
25,5.0,This is a great place to visit lots of history right in front of you perfectly preserved for tourists and Koreans who want to visit the local palaces. There are many palaces in Seoul but this is a very nice one which really is nicely preserved and is super easy to navigate though. There paths are not good for people with mobility issues and I don’t think you could get a wheelchair in here. There is very little share and there is nothing in the palace to drink so make sure you bring water along. Great for all members of the family of all ages. Get yourself a hanbok and have a really traditional  experience
26,4.0,"One of my focus when I travel is to see and feel authentic architecture of the country that I travel to. But my wife has a different reason why we have to get into this palace, and it’s the Secret Garden, because that’s where her favorite Korean soap opera stories are based on. It’s like a time travel for her, and she can’t stop telling me the whole plot of the story where the scene was shoot on the very ground where we were standing on....all I have to do is agree to all of it.Take note of the schedules of the tour once inside because they offer it in different languages. The whole site is amazing, but half a day is good enough then you can move on to one of the Hanok villages nearby so that you can have a good comparison of how the royalties and the the common people live their lives. Do the tours yourself, the sites are just a short taxi ride from your hotel if you are around Meongdong area."
27,5.0,"I visited Changdoeokgung  palace at night. it;'s special event for Spring and Autumn only. if you love history then don't miss this event. I saw new atmosphere of palace under the light that was decorated for make each building look outstanding and attractive. there is many history about this place, but this time concept of this event it's about a prince in joeson dynasty who had many talent and very romance. story of him was remake to drama. anyway when walk to inside at night feel like to back to jeoson's time"
28,4.0,"in my own opinion, 2nd to Gyeongbokgung palace. there is a guided tour to the secret garden and you can book online. there is also a night tour of this Palace."
29,5.0,"Very nice palace grounds, with the bonus of the (pay extra) secret garden. Free tour makes the visit more meaningful."
30,4.0,decent palace with a few guards outside. dint visit inside in particular since we had been to the biggest palace in seoul
31,5.0,This is the prettiest of Seoul's palaces and alot of it has to do with the secret gardens which is the highlight. Make sure you go on a guided tour as I think it makes the place come alive more when you understand the use of the buildings and the history of the Korean monarchy.
32,5.0,"If you have a half day, I would highly recommend this place for a visit.  First time that I have visited this outstanding Korean Palace.  Lots of great places to take that Korea picture to send back home.  The old style of Korea past is all around you.  The government has done a great job in saving this jewel for all time.  My wife told me that not all of the grounds were not always open to the public.Just my thoughts: You will need at 3 or 4 hours to see most of the grounds.Wear your tennis shoes (loose gravel and uneven stairs).Even though it says handicap accessible, most of the palace is not set up for wheelchairs.You will also have problems with the kids stroller.Plenty of toilets throughout the grounds.Anyways, bring the camera and have a great time (we did)!"
33,4.0,Well for my opinion after I have been to Gyeongbokgung the shape of the building look similar design. It's very nice to walk around the garden right next to the palace wall.
34,4.0,Inexpensive and fascinating. All the local palaces are a great place to visit. You get to see some pretty gardens and people dressed in authentic outfits.
35,5.0,The palace is open after dark which lends a whole new experience to palace visits. The lake is illuminated and it's fun to watch all the kids with lanterns.
36,5.0,"Definitely a must see. We got lucky and managed to get tickets for the secret garden tour at the ticket box the morning we visited. This palace has an extensive history. There are a lot of historical and architectural elements that can be overlooked or missed so I would definitely recommend a guide or tour on first visit, but it is easy to appreciate the beauty of the place without one."
37,4.0,Visited area and noticed this site  lucky with weather today. Cool but no rain.  Access to site is by underground in area (line 2 green line) with both bus and taxi access easy.  Lots of restaurants and other eating houses around area. Good market in area.
38,5.0,"This is a lovely palace to walk around. Lots of things to see. It will only take you about and hour. You can dress up in national costume if you like, at a cost of course. Pretty gardens as well."
39,4.0,"the visit will be nothing without the guided tour. the translated guided tour is free of charge, and the guide was knowledgeable. listening to the reasons behind every detail of the palace makes us really think there a lot more than the eyes can see. very recommended!"
40,3.0,"If you’re into temples, palaces, history, parks, or a slower pace, head over to Changdeokgung Palace. Surrounded by modern skyscrapers, the palace built in 1405 feels like a time machine once you step through the large gates. The old architectural features have been maintained and you’re able to freely walk anywhere to get a glimpse of life behind the palace walls. Tickets are cheap at <$5 USD per person. The palace open from 10am to 6pm. This destination is kid friendly."
41,4.0,"A very well-preserved palace! Beautiful gardens. If you prefer culture and traditions more than just admiring modern buildings and large cities, this is a place for you! center of the Buddhist history of South Korea!"
42,5.0,"Great palace, which stole my heart immediately. Contrary to Gyeongbokgung which is flooded with people, Changeokgung didn't have as many visitors when I visited it. Unforgettable experience with the ability to look inside the palace through windows."
43,4.0,"Large area with many buildings, our guide was excellent in describing what the various buildings and areas were used for."
44,5.0,"I watched the ceremony, it's so cool! The place is beautiful and so intriguing to see the ceremony performance of the magistrate people and soldiers wearing traditional costumes of the olden days."
45,5.0,Visited in the winter and it was a pleasure... It must be absolutely amazing in the spring and summer.
46,4.0,"After Gyeonbokgung, this is considered the second most important palace from the Joseon Dynasty.  If you are here, be sure to line up in the morning and also get the Secret Garden tour which is a timed ticket and can be purchased at the counter or the ticket vending machine."
47,3.0,I think palaces at South Korea are just average. We wanted to go to the secret garden but didn’t know you have to buy the tickets no later than 20 mins before the tour starts. There’s also no food & I was starving.
48,3.0,"This palace is highly recommended to visit in Korea. However, my family and I found nothing special about the visit since all structures look alike and tourists cannot go inside the palace except hanging around the areas outside."
49,4.0,"This is one of ""similar"" places in Seoul. There are five or six places where the previous emperors have lived. Not a big difference, but the colors are a little bit different and the locations are different. Take a guided tour if possible and you'll learn more. Seniors get some discount, but you need to keep the passports with you to show your age."
50,5.0,I would suggest to go as tour then you will understand the historical value at the back of it. You will know how and why the palace is designed in certain way...Understand how people see the time in the old days... where is the king seated..
51,4.0,"I can only imagine just how large the grounds are until you visit the location. But what we enjoyed the most was the Secret Garden tour. The guide was very knowledgeable about the palace and garden. Because of the time of year that we were there, all of trees had lost most of their leaves and the ponds were partially frozen over. All in all, a worth while event if you are in Seoul."
52,5.0,"Changdeokgung (昌德宮) was built in 1412 and served as the secondary royal palace after Gyeongbokgung. The palace was burnt to ground in 1592 but then fully restored in 1618. Unlike Gyeongbokgung which was built on a leveled ground, Chandeokgung was built with better landscape design, with more trees and shrubs.We reached the palace at around 3:15 pm, and spent around 1 hour and a half there. Due to the time constraint, we didn't visit the secret garden. Changdeokgung is smaller compares to Gyeongbokgung, and we are using the same way to go in and and out. Thus we won't miss out any of the hall in the palace.The entrance fee for an adult is KRW 3000. Secret garden is a part of the palace, but we need to pay extra KRW 5000 to enter the garden (the ticket can be bought only at the entrance). Changdeokgung is near to subway Anguk Station (line 3 exit 3)."
53,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is a large park with many historic building.  Looking on line we saw that the secret garden tour was sold out but we were able to purchase tickets when we arrive at the palace.  During the fall they allow visitors to tour the secret garden on your own, not with the tour.  Great place for photos, many visitors in traditional dress."
54,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace was my favorite palace visited on my trip to Seoul. I was here later in the day after visiting Gyeongbokgung and it was far less crowded and more peaceful. The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace."
55,5.0,We came when it was raining the entire day. The palace was beautiful but the rain made it hard to walk because the floor is sand. People come here to see the garden. But you will need to get tickets in advance. It is a separate payment from the entrance fee because it has a separate tour. It's 3000 won but free for children under 6 and seniors 65 above. It's definitely a good place to visit in the fall because of all the trees and probably during the spring.
56,5.0,"UNESCO World Heritage-listed, this palace will make you feel like you are in old Korea. As soon as you step inside, it's as if the madness of modern Seoul has gone - everything is quiet, beautiful, and peaceful. I 100% recommend the guided tours (English ones offered twice a day) as without them it'd be hard to understand the history of the place. Our guide was excellent and we enjoyed listening to her. The highlight of our visit was by far the Secret Garden. While it says you HAVE to enter with a tour, once you buy your ticket and go in they give you the option of a 'self guided tour' or a 'guided tour' - if you choose the first option you can just walk around on your own, which is what we did. It was beautiful! Nothing like a walk in the park to see real Korea."
57,5.0,"One of those 5 palace in seoul. Beautiful architecture and lots of joseon kingdom history. This palace is full of visitors and tourist. If given a chance, secret garden tour is a must to visit where it was once a secret recreation place for the royalty. Beautiful and full of red leaves in autumn season."
58,5.0,"On a beautiful cool crisp fall afternoon in Seoul, my wife and I visited this palace and we were so glad we did. We’ve always visited Kyungbok Palace but I have not visited this palace and boy were we glad. We followed a Korean guide and he was excellent with so many stories about each of the rooms and rich histories that brought the entire palace to life. It is such a sad place as well as it was where our last King was forced to sign the treaty with Japan early 1900s.  Also, when Japan took over Korea, they try to make mockery of our history by making the kings palace a zoo until few  the dacades ago Korean government got rid of the zoo and restored the palace to current glory.  The story of a king’s love for one of his wife and the house he built for her. The persimmon tree in front of this house was full of grown persimmons that hung from the skinny branches screaming for to be plucked for consumption but we could not. The afternoon was just perfect not only to experience the amazing architecture but to learn about the Korean history as well. I highly recommend to follow a guide for the full experience. Go there and you won’t regret it."
59,5.0,We spent a lovely sunny afternoon exploring the Palace and its grounds whilst in Seoul.  There were lots of things to see and even though it was bustling with tourists it felt peaceful to walk around.
60,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden were the highlight of our two week trip to Korea. The buildings, the gardens, everything was so beautiful. The mix of preservation and reconstruction has been done beautifully. We were here for two hours, that was enough time to see all of the secret garden and most of the palace buildings. The secret garden tour is 100% worth the effort to get tickets. We booked online six days in advance. The online booking has a quirk, they don't email you your tickets, instead you need to save them as a pdf, print that out & take it to the ticket office."
61,5.0,"We found Changdeokgung Palace to be the most picturesque of the palaces, with the various building nestled among tress and gardens. You can visit the normal palace grounds at anytime, but it is definitely worth pre-planning and make sure you book the secret garden walking tour as well. It's included in the price, but you need to get a separate ticket (either online or there on the day), but spaces for each tour are limited. You'll also need to check what language each tour is in. However, if you miss you chosen language, it would still be worth it just to see the garden."
62,5.0,"The Changdeokgung Palace is a great place to visit, consider purchasing the royal palace pass that includes 4 palaces and the royal shrine for 10,000 (approx $8.80USD).All palaces have an English brochure at the ticket counter.This palace was destroyed and rebuilt in 1610, it was the main palace for about 270 years.Consult your brochure for the times of the Secret garden tour, you can only access the garden through a tour.  English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese language tours are available.  The garden tour has extensive walking."
63,4.0,"The palace is well maintained, the day we were there it was raining, We also visited Huwon Secret garden. The guide as good but the time given to enjoy the place was short. The tour is about an hour covering 5 different areas in the garden. We will given only 5-10 minutes to walk around and take photos. But the tour is worth t."
64,5.0,"We came early morning to Changdeokgung Palace to make sure we could secure tickets to the Secret Garden and booked both a tour of the palace and the gardens on arrival. The palace is huge, and our guide brough the place to life, explaining each of the different parts of the complex. The buildings themselves are beautiful, but it was for the gardens that we really came. So at the end of the tour we rushed to join our garden tour, where we were shown around the highlights of the gardens. At the end we were left to make our own way back which was great, as it meant we could take time to appreciate the place without the crowds. The gardens in autumn are gorgeous, with the red and amber leaves framing the pagodas and ponds. It is a wonderful place to take photos as long as you manage to avoid the crowds. Worth a trip!"
65,4.0,"Changdeokgung palace is the 2nd palace of the Joseon Dynasty, the architecture is not as grand and stately as Gyeongbokgung palace, the main palace. However, the highlight is the secret garden. Occupying 60% of the entire palace ground, it's lot more than a garden. It has many leafy valleys, trees, ponds, pavilions and buildings. Visitors must join a 1.5 hour guided tour to see the secret garden. It's quite good indeed as we learned some history and heard some stories from our guide."
66,4.0,Tourist hangout but well worth it when guards make the change. Garden is beautiful. Surrounding area is walkable and City Hall cross over the plaza.
67,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty palaces located in Seoul, Korea. While not as large in scale as the main Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung boasts its own unique features such as being built with a closer to nature theme in mind.The buildings here tend to be smaller and closer together, but the main attraction here is the Secret Garden built for royal recreational activities. The Secret Garden is only open for admission via daily tours, so you'll have to book online or ask for the availability (more risky) on the day of your visit.I enjoyed the visit because the architecture and atmosphere of Changdeokgung is unique and different, with a closer emphasis to nature. The buildings also felt more ""authentic"" and I enjoyed the relative quietness of the area as compared to the busier and larger Gyeongbokgung. The Secret Garden tour also offered a special glimpse into the past lives of Korean royalty.Changdeokgung is just a short walk away from Changgyeonggung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Gyeongbokgung Palace, so if you have the time, be sure to visit them all in a single day.Would recommend Changdeokgung as the No. 2 Joseon era palace to visit after Gyeongbokgung. Still, the palace is serene and quiet. There is a cafe within the palace grounds as well."
68,5.0,Well kept buildings & provide a sense how the elite lived in Korea. Be prepared to walk as the palace ground is vast.
69,3.0,"entrance fee: 3,000 won for entering Changdeokgung Palace (free if dress up in Hanbok); another 5,000 won for entering Secret Garden, booking may be required.No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there.  It was very humid in July when I went there.  But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall. In general, the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace."
70,5.0,Beautiful ancient architectures and gardens. This will make you think how those people 600 years ago then were so intelligent even without the technologies we have today. Remember to take lots of photos with such beautiful scenery. You will not fail to notice lots of beautiful trees and hundreds of years old Chinese junipers.
71,4.0,"We went to see the secret garden English tour which took about 90 minuets. There were about 50 people together. A guide was explaining about each spots in the garden and it was very interesting!! It was such a bloody hot day so it’s better to bring some water with you if you visit in summer!! The garden paths are up and down, so it’s better to wear comfortable shoes!!(spots shoes are better)"
72,4.0,"This royal complex including the palace and surroundings definitely worths a visit. It is representative of korean imperial period, but it is much smaller and simpler than their chinese counterparts."
73,5.0,A beautiful peaceful place in the center of the city. I recommend buying the integrated palace ticket as it offers great saving
74,4.0,"For history lovers ,what can be better than visiting a palace dating back to about 800 years ago?  The area is wide and so many houses and rooms are located in this area.you had better to study some of it's history if you want to visit without a tour leader."
75,5.0,"Smack in the middle of Seoul, this oasis makes you feel like you are far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The palaces are very well preserved and the gardens are just beautiful. Every day at 3:00 and 4:30 pm there is a tour of the Secret Garden which you cannot enter on your own. We did the tour and you get to see a big area of the complex otherwise not accessible to visitors. It's free of charge if you buy the booklet with access to this palace and Gyeongbokgung."
76,4.0,"one of the most impressive and beautifully preserved structures displacing the 1400's  architecture in downtown Seoul.. The changing of the guard ceremony is also rich and impressive,"
77,3.0,"Came here to have a look at the palace and especially, the guard changing ceremony. Located quite near City Hall metro station. Guard changing at 11am and lasted just a short while before the whole ceremony repeats again. There is a small booth for a quick free hanbok rental that allows you 3 mins to put on for photoshoot. The palace itself is not that big. If you just want to see the guard changing ceremony, just come to the outside of the palace as you do not need entrance ticket for it. Interesting to see the guard changing ceremony though."
78,4.0,"Changdeokgung is conveniently located close to downtown Seoul, just a short walk from Insadong. If you're only going to visit one palace in Seoul, I suggest Gyeongbokgung since there's more to see but Changdeokgung is also a very nice place to escape the hurried athmosphere of the city.If you're planning to visit the secret garden, make sure to reserve in advance and check the timetable for tours. Admission to the palace is separate and only costs somewhere around 1000 won per person."
79,4.0,"Wanted to visit gyeongbokgung but it was closed on a tuesday, so we settled for this instead. Free admission if you wear Hanbok. Not as pretty as Gyeongbokgung in my opinion and after awhile every part looks the same. Nevertheless, we still took some pretty photos in our hanbok."
80,4.0,"We went to see this palace built during Joseon dynasty and the palace was a reminder of great design work at that time. You need to go to Anguk station exit 3 and walk about 450 to 500 m, please follow the sign to find this palace"
81,5.0,It’s nice place clean and so peaceful and beautiful garden to walk can be romantic as well many young people’s hangout in weekend and wear Korea customized outfits they look so beautiful too been here many times but still love it
82,4.0,"I didn't even see the entire palace, because it is enormous. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking.The architecture is simply a wow, and the restoration work keeps the vibrancy alive. Two things that stood out: the portrait gallery with it's haunting lack of portraits (one can only imagine!), and the wonderful trees they have gone to some pains to keep. The trees alone were worth going to see. (Yeah, I'm weird that way.)"
83,5.0,The palace is nice but in my opinion the Secret Garden is the highlight. Unfortunately you can only visit it as part of tour but it's worth it.
84,4.0,"wear hanbok and take instagramable pictures. Go to Gyeongbukgung first before here. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall.  Moreover , there are english and mandarin tours to explain the korea history to us."
85,3.0,"I think if you have done much travelling in Asia this site may not live up to expectations. Yes, the grounds are huge but there isn’t really a lot to see. There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren’t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don’t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace, hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part, very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds."
86,3.0,"After seeing 2 other palaces, this one seemed no different. But it was interesting to see how barren their homes used to be and what counted as luxury hundred years ago."
87,5.0,"This place has a very huge area and the architecture of the building is stunning. We did not enter the palace area & secret garden as I did not enjoy the weather - it was too cold for me ! But, I will definitely visit again if I have the chance.."
88,5.0,"The palace is nice, less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and a bit smaller, so I liked this one more. But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the place. I stayed back for the first few buildings, then decided to explore on my own, since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them (the tour is limited to 100 people). I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group, or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful, we were lucky with the weather; sunshine and blue sky. It was just amazing and I took a million pictures (see below :-)), a total MUST DO if you love gardens. I would go back and book the tour again, it's so beautiful!"
89,5.0,"I'm not sure which is which, but this pair of palaces and the Secret Garden almost compare in scope to the Forbidden City in Beijing. What they lack in size and grandeur, they make up for in aesthetics. The palace is lovely and verdant. Buy the Royal Pass for a few extra 1000 Won (a few $) and see the Secret Garden, both palaces, the temple across the street (also a UNESCO heritage site) and spend the day walking the pathways of Korean kings and queens of old."
90,5.0,"Two weeks ago we visited this Palace and Secret Garden on a guided tour.It was a highlight of our holiday.  The tour guide gave us a glimpse of what life would have been like and was well prepared with answers to any questions.The secret garden does involve a hill climb that is short but not suitable for anyone on crutches or in a wheelchair or with breathing difficulties, however if the guide is informed they will take an alternative route.A very peaceful and historic place to visit.Toilets are spread around and places to buy drinks.  Very clean."
91,4.0,"It was an awesome place, no need to line up and buy a ticket for entrance just pass trough only when you are wearing a Traditional Korean clothes..  hanbok rental clothes gives you entrance to all the palaces for free..except for the changdeokgung secret garden where you have to book it online and wish you’d get a free pass...Palace offers different location where you can do your photo shoot and see the instructures of the buildings in the sorrounding area and walls you just need to see the beauty behind the camera lenses..Plus it a 15 minutes walk to the main Palace..and it’s not that crowded like the main palace..."
92,4.0,The building and its furniture are representing the of its time the throne room is great it is a must see
93,4.0,"Walking round the palace is wonderful, although very busy at the weekend.  The highlight was the secre5 garden, which has limited tickets on sale each day.  Plus you must visit as part of a tour.Worth getting there early on a weekday to secure your ticket.  Almost impossible at the weekend!"
94,5.0,"I loved this place. I loved how many people, mainly foreigners wore the traditional clothing. I feel it added to the atmosphere. Was great to see the changing of the guards."
95,5.0,"If you are visiting Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace is a MUST! Tip: you can only see the “secret” gardens with a guided tour, offered just outside the garden gates."
96,3.0,I went at 10 am and there were not a lot of people. The palace buildings are nice and there are some beautiful details. Some of the trees were blossoming which gave it a more picturesque aura.When we tried to go to the Secret Garden we realised we can only visit with a tour. So be aware that you may have to wait for the next tour to get in. The tour took 1h30m. If you are into tours than by all means wait and go. I did and sincerely regretted it. The tour doesn’t give you a lot of useful information and you also are not allowed to walk freely and admire what you want to look at. I left the palace with mixed feelings.
97,5.0,It’s big place and have to visit too many palace and historical place.. I recommend to visit in morning .. it close at 5
98,5.0,"Sometimes I feel like the cultural side of Korea is hard to find, everything centered around tourist gimmicks, etc. But this place really feels genuine."
99,5.0,"The palace was very well kept, also very big! Ticket price was very acceptable compared to what i was imagining! Loved the open area and the gardens around it"
100,4.0,"I thought entrance was free, until i realized we were at a section that was free. Paid KRW6000 per person, but was fascinated by the historic culture and the sheer number of people (tourists) dressed in the Korean traditional clothes.. I've heard its free entrance or something if tourist wears that.. but not 100% sure."
101,1.0,"I dont like this place , it wasnt that much intresting to me , all of the palace had same looking and we cant go inside a rooms , dosnt have too much furnitureIn all i dont like there only one thing was intresting to me, other tourist wear treditional dress and i liked that"
102,3.0,"Having been to China and Japan this palace is definitely disappointing,  And it really is a reproduction.  That being said you do have to go.  The changing of the guard was interesting and worth seeing."
103,4.0,"One of the main palace around Seoul, although almost the same with the Gyeongbukgung, the history to it are totally different. You could get a local tour to explain the histories of the palaces if you fancy history and would like to know the differences, otherwise you could just read from the writings throughout the different section of the palace. We enjoy quiet walk by ourselves and admiring the architecture so we did not engage with one."
104,5.0,"This is the largest palace in Seoul but less crowded, and much more interesting.Well preserved, more original buildings, very large with the gardens.Recommended"
105,3.0,"Sure it is one of a kind to visit a royal palace, but in Seoul, they all looked the same to me. The layout, architecture, Colour are too similar. But you can visit three of them and spend all the morning till noon time. Palaces are well reserved."
106,2.0,"One of the top ""things to do"" in Seoul and we are still wondering why... there were loads of tourists here and yes, you can dress up in traditional clothes for some good photos, but apart from that, it is nothing worth spending more than 30mins on."
107,5.0,"We arrived to explore the historic Bukchon area and one of the first places we discovered was Changdeokgung Palace and it's growing queue.  We decided to take our place in the queue as in the few minutes we pondered what to do next, the line was growing by the minute.  The wait to get tickets was around 30 minutes - which I didn't mind a bit as it was fascinating watching the locals, young and old arrive in their beautiful traditional dress.The Palace offered lots of history and insight into the culture. Constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty and rebuilt in 1610 after being destroyed during the Japanese invasion.  It then served as the main palace for 270 years.  The Koreans in traditional dress added to the intrigue.We paid extra to go into the secret garden and were pleased we had.  The autumn colours were beautiful.  We didn't do a guided tour due to the next tour not being an English one.  We didn't feel  we missed out on anything not doing the guided tours, we had a good brochure to guide us around."
108,5.0,Great palace and great museum! Easy to get there and walk around. It is also within a short walking distance from the oldest active Buddhist temple in Seoul.
109,2.0,I was really unimpressed with the signage out the front to enter to the gardens you need to pay again inside and it is close to the price of the pass for all the palaces. we would have bought that if we had known but this was not indicated on the price lists.
110,5.0,"Spent a couple hours here in early Jan. it was very cold so make sure to rug up because there is nowhere to go to keep warm. The place is huge and buildings are beautiful. Took a taxi from here to myeongdong and it was very cheap, 4000 w. You could also walk across the road to insadong."
111,4.0,Bigger than i expected. a lot of spot if you wish to have couple / family photo. Recommend to use handbook.
112,3.0,"We came here on our last day and it was good, smaller than Gyeongbokgung, but still worth visiting. Worth visiting if you are into history and architecture."
113,4.0,This is a smaller palace compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's close to the Bukchon hanok village.  It's worth a visit if you are into historical architecture.
114,3.0,"This was OK to see once. It didn't make me want to go out and visit the other 4 palaces afterwards. But you learn a bit about the history and you've gotta visit at least one palace while you're in Seoul. Otherwise, it was a large area with some old buildings (and some re-built ones) that didn't necessarily translate a sense of the importance of the place."
115,5.0,Must join the secret garden tour. That will be more worth it. Love the scenery. East to book using their online reservation website.
116,5.0,"UNESCO registered Changdeok Palace as a World Heritage site. This proves so much. Garden tour is given exclusively, but, very easy to make a reservation. And I'm deadly serious, YOU SHOULD GO THERE. Each seasons has different colors and different points of attraction."
117,5.0,"This Palace is one of my favorite things in Seoul so far, It's very big and has so many things to see."
118,4.0,It is a very nice palace to visit. We have also done the secret park - this is the best one to see. I would suggest to visit it before Gyeongbokgung Palace.
119,4.0,This place was very beautiful and very big. I feel that visiting this palace alone would already be sufficient versus visiting all 3 top palaces.
120,4.0,"It is huge; you need at least two hours to go through various halls which are related to Joseon Dynasty. The best part of the Palace is its secret garden which preserve its original topography which include several lotus ponds and small stream. Spend some time to walk through the garden. There is English guided tours for Palace buildings at 1015 hrs and 1315 hrs and for Secret Garden  at 1030, 1130, 1430 and 1530 hrs.  The palace is closed on all Mondays. Opening Hours: 0900-1800 hrs. Entry: Won 3,000; separate ticket for secret garden.  Metro: Jongno 3-ga Station (Line 1,3 or 5 Exit 6) OR Anguk Station (Line 3 Exit 3). You can combine this site with Bukchon Hanok Village which is about 15 minutes walk from the palace."
121,4.0,"Paid 3000 Won to enter, worth every penny, beautiful palace and gardens.Colourful tree leaves at this time of the year, red, orange, grey and green."
122,5.0,"This was great, especially with a free guide to explain everything.  The secret garden has a guide, In Fact you have to tour with a guide.  But the rest of the palace you'll want to schedule a guide.The secret garden in autumn is stunning!"
123,5.0,"The palace as with others in Korea does not have a lot of furniture or artefacts on display, however the palace its self and all the associated building as very interesting from an architectural viewpoint. Lots of people walking around wearing Hanbok which adds to the atmosphere. As other people have stated the secret gardens are not to be missed, very well laid out and when we were there last week the trees were in all their Autumn glory with vivid colours on display. (Not suitable for those with limited mobility).It's a huge complex if you decide to see everything on site including the secret garden and easily takes around two to three hours to enjoy it all.Would certainly recommend."
124,5.0,"Beautifully painted buildings (dancheong is the term for the painting) arranged in serene sight lines. Not too miss is the secret garden, a separate ticket is needed. The guided english tour was ok but seemed to be about the same information available on the placards. The gardens layout respects the contours of the hills, with man made intrusions carefully inserted into nature."
125,5.0,We spent a very pleasant morning here and wandered around the beautiful secret garden.  You wouldn't know you were in a large city it was so peaceful.
126,4.0,"This is a unique Korean palace built in harmony with surrounding landscape. To reach the palace, take Line 1, 5 and get down at Jongno 3-ga Station or Line 3 and get down at Jongno 3-ga Station or Anguk station. No smoking, flammables or pets are allowed within the palace grounds.Admission ticket is 3000 won.  With extra ticket , you can also get entry to nearby Changgyeonggung Palace. Guided palace tours in English are at 1030 am and 230 pm. The palace is closed on Mondays. Must-see attraction in Seoul"
127,5.0,"We came to explore the secret gardens which were beautiful as the leaves were changing colour. We joined a free English guided tour which was really informative. The guide was full of enthusiasm and gave us lots of history and stories about the garden. He did a Palace tour later in the day so we stayed for that too which was just as good although a little shorter. It's a beautiful palace, well maintained in nice grounds. The secret garden is the highlight."
128,4.0,"This is a nice stroll and you can see the elaborate colored paintings of the buildings.  It is joined with another palace so its easy top walk through both. We booked a secret garden tour online, book well in advance, and it was worth it.  The garden is really the most authentic part of the old palace."
129,5.0,"They are currently working on opening even more buildings on the palace grounds - it will become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and rightfully so.Also enjoyed seeing all the visiting tourists in their rented Korean costume."
130,3.0,We kept our visit of Changdeokgung Palace rather short since there is not much to see. The buildings are scattered in a rather large area. There are no detailed explanations about the life in the palace and the purpose of the different buildings. The gardens are pretty unkempt. Been there done that. If you're nearby have a look.
131,5.0,"This was our favorite palace in all of Seoul.  The grounds are beautiful and, with the grounds as background, the buildings provide a picture perfect setting."
132,5.0,"this review may not be useful to all as we took the annual night tour which is not open throughout the year - only at specified times. The tour was wonderful, very thorough, our guide spoke excellent english and gave a wonderful historical lesson on the palace. We visited ALOT of the palaces in Seoul, this was by far one our favorites!"
133,3.0,"Very interesting site, much of it purposefully left unrestored. Large site, the tour guide stated the grounds covered 110 acres.  Make sure you have comfy shoes and are prepared for a lot of walking. If you take to Secret Garden tour, be prepared for some fairly steep grades. It’s definitely not for mobility challenged individuals. One of the members on the tour dragged around luggage for the entire tour.  If you take luggage to the tour, do yourself and others the courtesy of storing your bags in a locker at a subway or rail station before you go here."
134,4.0,"This was visited after Gyeongbokgung and it was a contrast with different architectural styles. Their is a ""Secret Garden"" which we did not visit due to lack of time but the overall visit was still very interesting. A definite ""must see"" in Seoul."
135,4.0,"As well as the palace there is the secret garden (the King's hide-away), but this part can only be seen as part of a guided tour (check and reserve on-line), unlike the palace which can accessed any time during opening hours. Ensure you get to see both. The English language guide for the secret garden was very good (almost 90 mins tour). If you have time there is the Changgyeonggung Palace adjacent and reached by an inter-connecting gate."
136,4.0,"We just so happened to catch the free English tour of the palace and were glad we did. Our tour guide was fantastic and it was a pleasure to learn about the history. We then followed this with a tour of the secret garden. The garden was very nice to see, but not particularly spectacular. You have to have a guided tour and there were a lot of people when we were there which made it a bit tricky to hear, plus we had to keep stopping to wait for everyone to catch up / take photos etc which made it quite a long tour. Overall it was worth it though."
137,5.0,"This is a palace that was constructed around 1400 during the Joseon Dynasty. The palace has an impressive gate way which is welcoming and peaceful, also provides an insight into Korean architecture. It is an expansive compound with several structures, Kings council hall, residence, Queens residence, government offices, ornate ceilings, secret garden etc. So there is a lot of walking but not much climbing. It gives a glimpse into the Korean history and way of life. One thing that you take way after visiting the palace is iits harmony with nature."
138,5.0,"We had booked the secret garden tour and it is a must do when visiting this site. The rest of the palace is quite mediocre at best but the secret garden needs to be booked as part of a guided tour available in English, Korean and Chinese. It takes you over 90 minutes for the tour and takes you through gardens of the kings. Be warned though, there are a few sharp inclines and declines and be prepared to walk for a bit. But definitely recommend the secret garden tour."
139,4.0,"You can visit here using subway line 3, exit 3 at Anguk station.  However as we stayed nearby in Jogna 3, we walked here. As we arrived at almost closing time, we only managed a glimpse of the palace. Entry fees was KRW 3,000. This palace is quite well preserved and has a beautiful garden. Hope to return for a more thorough visit."
140,5.0,Visited here early morning and there wasn't the huge crowds of the other palaces.  Whilst here it is worth paying extra for Huwon tour.  The palace grounds are also a bit more compact and manageable to walk around.  Although still easy to get lost in all the alleys.
141,3.0,"It's a good space, and you can tell they work hard to reserve the place.  But the painted architecture seem to overly done so the shiny new paint looks too new unlike the charming old walls that look a bit more aged.  Would be nice to hear more stories or see more furnishing too ..."
142,5.0,We had a tour guide which really enhanced the overall experience. Well worth the time and effort to visit.
143,4.0,"Nevertheless, we made the most of the short time we had at this most amazing palace.Sprawling to say the least, grandiose in an understated way, mesmerizing in that once you try and picture what it must have been like for the hierarchy way back then. Salubrious to the max, opportunities to indulge with your concubines, and so it goes.If palaces aren't your thing, or you've seen many in the past, you could be forgiven for not going to this palace. However if you've not been to one before, do it. But just make sure you arrive with time up your sleeve so you don't miss out on the Secret Garden.P.S. It's darn cheap as well."
144,5.0,"Time out your visit so that you get the guided tour to the Secret Garden.  The buildings at the front are nice, but the garden and the guide will give you a better appreciation for the place.  We loved the buildings and plants and hills of the garden and our guide was very good."
145,4.0,"If you have been in Asia a bit like China, Vietnam...you may feel disappointed. The whole complex is rebuilt so not much impression . The good point is the great museum inside"
146,5.0,"For a foreigner, it seems quite similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace, except that this one is not overcrowded. That's why I enjoyed this palace. The architecture is very interesting and you can stroll at ease among the buildings. Very cheap entrance fee (3,000 won/person)."
147,5.0,I recommend doing the English tour starting around 1030 (check) of palace grounds. Need to book for the Secret Garden tour starting after. Gives you a lot of information about this heritage listed palace
148,4.0,Visited this unesco world heritage site after visiting gyeongkokgung palace nearby. They are different and worth visiting both. There is an audio tour you can take as well as a secret garden tour at a certain time each day.
149,4.0,"The Changdeokgung Palace is interesting, and a fairly ""walkable"" attraction for most. The rentable ""Audio Tour"" is probably essential, since most signage is limited to name labels, with little if any further explanation of each structure's actual use or purpose. With a couple of exceptions, existing structures are replicas of the originals, almost all of which were destroyed by Japanese invaders in the 1500s. Be aware when planning your sightseeing schedule."
150,5.0,"Located in the city it gave us a relaxed pause from the heat and the busy city-life.Entrance fee is KRW 3.000 per adult, if you want to see the secret garden they will charge you extra."
151,5.0,Very well preserved historic palace used by the rulers of the last dynasty in Korea! There are numerous buildings all well maintained as are the grounds! Particularly enjoyed all the young people walking around in costume and having photos taken with them! It's in the middle is Seoul and is a must see when there!
152,5.0,"Absolutely breathtaking ,and the gardens are just wonderfull,you do pay xtra to see the gardens as you only allowed to go with a guide ,but the palace grounds are free wander at your leisure."
153,5.0,"One of the bigger complexes and should definitely be put on your Seoul to do list. We didnt go into the secret garden, but we felt there was enough to see without booking the extra ticket and partly because you do have to reserve a place for the secret garden tour."
154,5.0,"We made our way to Changdeokgung Palace in time for the 10:30 am English tour, only to find that the tour actually started at 10:15 am. Oh well, self-guided tour it is.During summer, the palace is open from 9 am to 6:30 pm. Admission to the Palace only is 3,000 won (2.66 USD) per adult. We bought the Royal Palace Pass for 10,000 won (8.88 USD) each which gives us entry to Changdeokgung, the Secret Garden,Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine (ticket valid for 3 months).We booked the 11:30 am Secret Garden tour. The garden can only be viewed by guided tour and it is highly recommended that you book this ahead of time. Bookings can be done online here up to 6 days before your desired tour date. Sure enough, our tour was completely full. Our tour guide was excellent and spoke perfect American English.This tour was well worth doing. The gardens are beautiful. However, keep in mind that some degree of fitness is required; the garden is very hilly with steep inclines/declines and there are many steps at one point. The paths are generally paved and there is anti-slip matting in place on the steeper sections."
155,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung palace has the claim to fame but this palace it the real winner in Seoul. Be sure to partake in the secret garden tour, it only costs a couple of $/€ per person. If you take the tour you will see the most beautiful part of the palace with a knowledgeable, and sometimes funny, guide. There are only 2 tours per day for Westerners. Be sure to stuff yourself at breakfast because you can not bring any food into the complex."
156,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace, one of the UNESTO World Heritage sites in Seoul, is an elegant palace resided by many Yi Dynasty kings. Unlike other palaces in Seoul, this palace has vast and beautiful nature preserve inside the palace complex. Its peaceful surroundings and elegant palace buildings attract many visitors from all over the world. The palace's  Huwon (후원- 後苑-Rear Garden) with attractive lotus pond and pavilions surrounded by serene woodland is especially memorable to the visitors.At the ticket office in front of the palace, buy the combination ticket for the palace & Huwon (후원- 後苑-Rear Garden). Since the visit to Huwon is by guided tour only with a set time, you can take a look at the posted tour starting time and select the appropriate time for your guided tour of Huwon. Seniors from foreign countries are eligible for half-price admission when a proof of age such as passport or driver's license is presented to the ticket agent at the ticket window. Once you enter the palace compound by presenting your palace admissions ticket at the entrance, you can wander around the palace ground until your guided tour time to Huwon. Be at the guided tour entrance gate in time not to miss the guided tour. To be on safe side, allow 10~15 minutes for you to go to the guided tour entrance from the first entrance area. Upon entering Huwon through the entrance gate with your Huwon entrance ticket, your guide might allow you to wander around Huwon on your own at your own pace, because Huwon guides tend to walk at fast pace without waiting for slow walkers. At the end of the guided tour, your guide will give you free time to wander around Huwon and exit Huwon on your own. Allow for half a day for the palace/Huwon visit, and wear comfortable walking shoes or sneakers.On the palace ground, you will come across many young people wearing colorful Korean costume (Hanbok) making you feel as if you have embarked on a time travel to the past. Many of these young people wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) are tourists who are wearing rented costumes, because five major palaces in Seoul waive admission fees to  those wearing Korean costume. Note that wearing Korean costume (Hanbok) will allow these visitors free admission  to Changdeokgoong but not to Huwon (Rear Garden). Those Hanbok wearers still have to buy the ticket for the guided tour of Huwon (Rear Garden). Hanbok can be rented for a relatively low price from many shops at Eulji-ro Underground Shopping Center, located near Myeong-dong and Jongno."
157,4.0,Beautiful palace in the central of Seoul.... peaceful... Good for taking pictures. cheap entrance fees... not much crowded... mostly kids from school... 1 hour is enough to explore...  been to all palace in Seoul... all looks similar... so its better to visit any 2 palace instead of visiting all palaces.
158,5.0,Wonderful period costumes on the guards and beautiful ceremonial flags. Many Korean Tourists their wearing rented period costumes and adding to the pagentry of the Changing of the Guards.
159,5.0,Very similar to the G-palace in appearance but still worth a visit. The guided tour of the Secret Garden was filled with more stories and is very picturesque with its water features and pavilions.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
160,5.0,"The palace is beautiful, make sure to go early cause it closes early (about 5:30 pm), also the gardens are a MUST. You're allowed to enter to the gardens also with the guide tour and it costs extra, make sure to check the hours before you go cause we were in the last tour which was in korean and we didn't really understood anything."
161,5.0,Beautiful oasis in downtown Seoul. Lovely site of historical interest. Doing some reading about the palace beforehand will make your visit a better experience.
162,5.0,"There is a separate admission to the gardens, but that is what makes this palace special. We took the English tour of the gardens. We did the palace on our own. The palaces all have their own history but are fairly similar in appearance. This tour is best in nice weather."
163,4.0,"Whilst seeing the palace structures were fascinating, the Secret Garden tour was amazing. I was sceptical as I thought the guide was going to show us just flowers and plants and this tour was scheduled to be 90 minutes which initially worried me. However, the tour and tour guide were superb. There was more to see than flowers and plants and there were so many interesting nuggets of information regarding the structures in the garden. The 90 minutes zipped by."
164,5.0,"If you have seen another Korean palace by now, you are at some point going to say. Oh No more of the same. But the secret garden is just from somewhere else. Plan your day to be in time for the English guided tour and start with this tour. It's about 1.30 to 2 hours. So keep yourself prepared for some walking. You can enter the place only with a guide!! There are bits that are surreal. Depending on the weather and time of the day views can be magnificent with reflections from lakes and ponds and the beautiful old Korean buildings. Not to forget the numerous plants and buildings. We just loved this garden. As for the palace, not bad but hey we had seen the other palace the other day and we liked it but it was like a little bit more of the same. Enjoy!!"
165,4.0,"I visited this palace using the palace combination ticket, where for 10,000 krw you can visit 4 temples and 1 shrine, it's a great deal. This particular Palace is not as big as the main palace, but still quite a walk to explore the whole thing, definitely take the guided tour to the secret garden, it is well worth it! And it's included in the combination ticket."
166,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful and well-preserved. Ensure that you also buy a ticket to enter the Palace Garden (Hu-won in Korean), which you can only visit through a guided tour. Full of beautiful pavilions, little ponds and stories. I visit Changdeokgung whenever I go back Korea, and each time it mesmerises me with its beauty."
167,3.0,"We went here for the changing of the guards ceremony which was interesting to see, although it was repeated several times, not sure why. I guess if you are running late, you can still catch it. It was running for almost 30 minutes from the time it started. At some point, you can take some pictures with the ""commander"", which was a little cheesy. There's a booth right at the front where you try on the ancient costumes, so we used them to take some pictures in front of the gate."
168,5.0,"a must visit when in Seoul!! Changdeokgung is special among the five grand palace, with its Secret Garden or Huwon, a serene garden located at the back of the palace, once used by the royals for leisure and relaxing. You better visit in the morning when it's not crowded yet. entrance tiket is for free if you visit wearing hanbok. we visited the palace on Thursday, and we can enter the Garden without joining a guided tour, which normally on any other day, we only able to enter the garden on a guided tour. take your time visiting the palace and the secret garden, and don't forget to visit Changgyeonggung, which located right next to Changdeokgung"
169,5.0,The palace is quite big and it is the grandest one compared to other palace. You can still see the footprints of ancient time. A secret garden is very well preserved and only with tour guide is allowed to explore the garden.
170,5.0,This is a must see especially for the guard changing! The museum is well layed out and informative.  Entrance fee is cheap too.
171,5.0,"We had limited time for the palace itself, but were lucky enough to be there for the changing of the guard (traditional ceremony). Quite nice...but stay away from the big drum...."
172,5.0,Very interesting palace which was the old palace. The different buildings on sight gives the option to understand how did the leaders live.
173,4.0,"I don't know too much about Korea but this palace compound was built in 1405 so it's well over 600 years old.  Interesting to see this in the center of Seoul with all the traffic and other more modern buildings.  To be honest, after visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing, any other Asian palace pales in comparison.  It was still interesting to travel into Seoul to see it."
174,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace secret garden is a must visit! This requires a separate entry ticket, but well worth it.  The garden is very well maintained and simply beautiful and very enjoyable for a leisurely walk.  Join the guided tour for background information about each of the sites within the garden.  Allow at least 2-3 hours so you can enjoy the palace leisurely.  The palace (building) portion itself is nice, but the highlight is really the secret garden (rear garden).  For those who are hoping to see the pond and bridge featured in the Korean Drama ""Rooftop Prince"" - sadly the drama is not filmed here.  Nevertheless, the garden is still beautiful and worth a morning's visit!"
175,5.0,Absolutely stunning! Just like what I have seen in Korean historical drama and movies. Come early to explore from corner to corner
176,4.0,"We spent 3 hours in the afternoon following the map wondering around the beautiful pavillions and enjoyed fresh air, cool breeze and many gardens that full of blooming azaleas and other plants. Some sections were hilly but we took the opportunity to sitdown and rest after every climbs."
177,4.0,"It was great timing that a concert was happening when we visited this palace. An orchestra played and an opera singer performed beautiful traditional Korean songs. Surrounded by the palace structures, the music played fit for their king made one feel like a throwback in the Joseon era."
178,5.0,Much smaller grounds and we loved the secret garden. The walk around the lake was very relaxing. The architecture is amazing. Lots of places to have a picnic.
179,5.0,"Similar to Gyeongbokgung, good for exposure to local culture. Few areas to rest away from the sun. Has a secret garden but it requires a fee. Bonus is that it's connected to Changgyeongung Palace (found in the entrance to the secret garden). Changgyeongung has more trees (more cover from the sun), more areas to rest in.Compared to Gyeongbokgung, this place has markedly less people. (Or maybe we were just lucky then)."
180,5.0,It was just simply amazing! There's no words that I can use to describe the feeling that overcame me when I visited this palace. It was like I simply wished that I could have seen when it was a place where people still lived. It was like a maze and the structures were impressive! The intricate designs were gorgeous! What I love about it is the people who came to see the area wearing hanboks! I so love them dearly! They we're really really amazing! They all look so lovely and pretty!
181,4.0,"We went there because it was close to the hotel. It's really pushed as breathtaking but it's not. It's a smaller version of the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's also a replica. The origami was destroyed and this was rebuilt strictly for tourists. It's buildings only, no furniture or anything else that would help you imagine what life would have been like. The good thing is that it's free for seniors."
182,5.0,Make sure you get to see the changing of the guard which happens at regular intervals throughout the day. Closed Mondays. Free entry if you wear traditional Korean Hanbok clothing - for hire very reasonably in various locations around the palace.
183,5.0,Another must visit palace. The buildings are old but well maintained. Great place for photo taking and walk.
184,5.0,Changdeokgung Palace was place to walk around and discover. You can take a tour which includes a garden tour. It was quite beautiful in late March with the cherry blossoms. Less crowds in early morning!
185,5.0,Got here just in time to roam around the outside of the palace and see the displays of the old tools and homes. The place is very nice. We did not go in to the museum but you get to learn a lot of the heritage from the outside too.Must witness the changing of the guard which we caught at 1pm.
186,4.0,A worthwhile place to visit there is a traditional guard ceremony at the main gate every 2 hoursThe palace grounds are nice to walk round and loads of information in English.
187,5.0,"I enjoyed walking through this old palace. When you go early in the morning, it is not as busy and the atmosphere is great. Wonderful place to take pictures and imagine for yourself the busy lives of people living here in the past."
188,5.0,"Although this is a ""secondary"" palace it is no less of a ""must-see"" destination in Seoul. There is a beautiful park towards the back part of the palace grounds that is wonderful for walking."
189,3.0,"Nice if you have the time, if not I would opt for Gyeongbokgung palace and the Bukchon Hanok Village (around sunset it's even nice). As many of the touristic sites many tourists and locals are wearing traditional Korean clothing so you can get some nice (and sometimes funny) pictures."
190,5.0,Beautiful architecture! Especially the roofs and how every building's roof layer with each other. If you like ancient oriental architecture this is a must visit.You will also see many people walking around in Hanbok. I believe it is because entering in Hanbok is free and it's a great place to take photos in Hanbok too. There is also a separate area called the Secret Garden which one can only enter by joining a guided tour that comes in different languages. I chose the English tour and learnt a lot about the palace's history.
191,4.0,"This Palace is very similar to the Gyeonbokgung Palace, but much smaller.  If you are  short on time I would go to the Gyeonbokgung Palace.  An hour would be enough to see the entire place."
192,4.0,Saw changing of the guards Buildings are very interesting and seem to be in the middle of SeoulIf you can go with a guide or someone knowledgeable it makes the visit far more informativePrepare to spend a couple of hours
193,4.0,"During winter time the beauty of this place is impaired, so if you have to choose go to Gyeongbokgung Palace instead. However, in Autumn and Spring time, I believe this might be a must seeing sight. Before going, check on the website the guided tour timetable, since you can only visit the Secret Garden if you join one. It works the same way for the Jongmyo Shrine, but if I'm not wrong you can visit it without guide on Saturdays."
194,5.0,The secret garden is beautiful anytime of the year. But lots of walking and steps. Lots of locals in costumes as well to enjoy
195,4.0,"Really large palace, there is a secret garden but you can only visit with tour guide, dont miss it and check to tour guide time for it not expencive"
196,5.0,"It's not the biggest, but in my opinion is the most beautiful! The palaces are all somewhat similar but the secret garden tour makes this one stand out from the rest. If your short on time, make this palace a priority! It may not be ask we'll known as the main palace but it is stunning!"
197,5.0,"This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace, but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four, they offer walking tours in English, Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees, beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture, it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don't hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!"
198,4.0,This was our first activity in Seoul and it was a wonderful introduction into Korean history and architecture. It was raining the entire time that we were there so we did not do the secret garden. Luckily the rain did not ruin the experience of the palace.
199,5.0,"Among the palaces we visited in Seoul, this is my favorite. Great architecture. Feels like I was in one of the Saeguk dramas. Don't miss the Secret Garden and Deoksugung within the complex."
200,4.0,"the palace is 5 minutes walk from Anguk station, exit 1. Fortunately during my visit, I've been granted by free admission as the palace open for free on the last Wednesday of every months. The temperature was very cold as i visited the place during the winter and i suggest you to avoid winter if you wish to fully explore the beauty of the palace. Winter also not too bad as the scenery was stunning, the roofs covers by white fresh snow that make the buildings looks lovely and romantic. But due to negative temperature, it will limit your steps to explore the entire boundary. Believe me, it is worth to at least pay a visit once to this landmark, you will not regret."
201,4.0,"This palace has much to explore, almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you, if you ask nicely! We spent around 3 hours walking around all the small buildings and stopped for coffee in the cafe on the grounds, (decent coffee, not overpriced at 3500won)."
202,3.0,Those that come here should see the secret garden as well. This palace is quite plain in the winter. The palace felt dull by the lack of colors.
203,3.0,"Very good architecture, worth a trip to understand the culture. You can also walk into the deeper end to see the secret garden and the secondary palace for added charge (boooo....)."
204,5.0,"First impression was it was like the other palaces, sculptured tiles and painted roofs. Going on a little farther, one came to a part that looked humbler but actually more beautiful. Plain carved wooden wall and roof. This was built for a concubine and done not to stoked the jealousy of the queen. Would love to come here in warmer clime to see the garden."
205,4.0,"Changdeok Palace is one of my favorite palaces out of the 4 main palaces in Seoul because it houses the Secret Garden. While all the other buildings  and corners within the Changdeok Palace premises are pretty and worth seeing, I highly recommend that any new visitors also include a walk through the Secret Garden, which require joining a tour group and paying an entrance fee of KRW 5000 per adult. The tour takes about an hour and is provided in different languages. It's a good idea to check the schedule beforehand. It is fun to hear about the history related to each of the areas within the Palace. The different pavillions are also quite fascinating to see. Also, the Palace is known to have a different look in each season, each unique and each equally worth the visit. It is also conveniently situated near the Seoul central business district.  Hope you enjoy! 서울 한복판에 잘 보존되어 있는 창덕궁은 정말 큰 보물인 것 같습니다. 계절마다 다른 아름다움이 있다고 합니다. 이번 크리스마스 직후 추운 날씨에 갔는데도 후원을 거닐면서 각기 다른 정자들을 보는 것이 큰 즐거움이였습니다."
206,5.0,"This is a magnificent royal palace and a must see in Seoul. The secret garden tour was very interesting and beautiful, I highly recommend taking the guided tour on it."
207,4.0,Enjoyed our day here. Some interesting culture and open buildings but all a bit same after a while. Still I'd recommend a visit.
208,3.0,"This palace was built in 2005. It shows the style of the period, but on a cold January day, seemed rather bleak, with nothing but similar style, empty buildings. One building had a lovely painted ceiling, and I believe there is a wonderful garden in better weather."
209,4.0,Recommended for families and couples who do not like shopping. Great place to learn about korea culture and history while taking in the scenic views.
210,5.0,"Go on a guided tour of this palace which the Kings of Korea preferred over Gyeongbuk Palace for its feng shui.  The palace was not at all crowded on a Tuesday afternoon last week.  Make sure you get there early enough to visit Biwon, the Secret Garden, which closes at 4:00 pm"
211,5.0,Beautiful.  It is a must!And the English guide tour was just perfect. Very detailed information & perfect english
212,3.0,"The palace could be more beautiful during fall, but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour, and again, the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter, it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history, though."
213,5.0,"Walking here from Myeongdong was reasonable. There is a small admission fee to explore the grounds. We liked looking at the different buildings. The bathrooms were updated and very clean, which was surprising considering what a big tourist attraction it is."
214,4.0,It's an amazing experience to visit the palace at night. Although it only opened during moonlight but we are managed to do so in our visit to Seoul. It's a nice experience to see and experience to the culture.
215,4.0,If you love culture and history I'm recommend this place for you since there are many places near it you will need a full day to visit them.
216,3.0,"So here goes - I'm just going to be honest - pretty boring. Yes, architecture is interesting, and in a city of modern buildings, certainly a sense of the real Korea. But for me, building after building, without any context. I deliberately didn't read anything about the pace, just so that I could find our more when I was there - so I'm none the wiser."
217,4.0,This temple and its grounds are lovely. It seems by the amount of tourists that is a must see place. It was a nice quiet day spent strolling around the grounds.
218,4.0,"Very nice and clean, but a lot of walking inside, wear a pair of sneakers.  Tourists like us must take a look of this empty palace."
219,3.0,"This palace, like others, provides only a glimpse into what was.  Still, worth seeing the size, scale and furnishings.  Can be crowded with tourists but the space is big enough not to feel constrained."
220,4.0,"This is one of Seoul's famous palaces, a bit like a miniature Forbidden City. The place has been very well restored, and it's certainly worth a visit. But the fact that the interiors are unfurnished is a bit disappointing. The highlight is definitely the beautiful Secret Garden. We visited in November, so were treated to the beautiful autumn colours."
221,5.0,Some of the other palaces in Seoul can be overwhelmed with people visiting however I found Changdeokgung nice and quiet for better photos. Nice to look around before exploring the traditional village next door :)
222,4.0,Very well renovated grouping to palace buildings in a very tranquil setting.   Several English language tours at reasonable prices every day.  And a 'secret garden' that is expansive and impressive.  Easy to see the whole thing in 90 minutes.  Take a taxi or it's a 7-10 minute walk from the Anguk subway station.    And it's a short walk afterwards to the area with the traditional Korean houses.    Make a morning of it!
223,5.0,"Greats place to visit if you are looking at the ancient parts of Seoul, suitable for all ages and accessible to most.  Close to the main part of the city.  You do not need to tour guide but handy to use one if you want all the background information"
224,5.0,"This royal villa, declared UNESCO world heritage and main palace for many kings, is a must see when you visit Seoul.The entire complex is located in a huge land and it consists in a large number of buildings, all with interesting explanations in order to understand their importance and meaning.The main entrance of the Palace is located in the southwest area, close to the intersection of Yulgongno (avenue) and Mareunnaegil. It is close to Anguk Metro Station (Line 3)"
225,5.0,Yes a lot of these palaces are similar; but all a bit different. We really enjoyed the walk and the gardens.It felt a bit less crowded and a bit more traditional than gyeongbokgung. I would recommend it if you want to visit something something a bit more quiet; though make no mistake there will be plenty of tourists.Very easily accessible by tube. A great weekend outing which took us a couple of hours!
226,4.0,"It's best to join a tour with an English speaking tour guide like Sunny of the VIP Tours that we booked. She had an excellent explanation of the different buildings and purpose at it is said to be built in harmony with the landscape. there is a lot of walking because of the spacious design including a secret garden. The guide was able to relate what takes place in the different buildings and pavilions and makes one feel that they were part of the ceremonies. The palace is open 9:00 to 18:00 but during winter only up to 17:30. It is also closed on Mondays. Adults pay Won3,000 or a little below $3 and children pay W1,500 . if traveling on your own, you can take the subway or the Bus and join the scheduled tours by the park like English is 10:30 and 14:30... The palace is preserved and restored even after it was destroyed during the Japanese invasion (1592-1598)  and after that was used by the monarchy for 270 years. This was preserved until this date for tourism purposes."
227,4.0,"This is a series of beautiful buildings and a palace where the royal family lived. Its architecture blends with the surrounding nature and landscape. The Palace is where the kings dealt with state affairs. All the buildings are decorated and made of wood and have a stone platform. Being of wood, they have been damaged by fires during the centuries and rebuilt. The whole park is quite big and includes ponds and many tress, some of which seemed very old."
228,4.0,"So much into Korean royalty history.  So interesting to see the King's palace and the Queen's palace, how they rule and what their restrictions are.  The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up.  When you're in Seoul, at least visit one of these heritage sites.  This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs.  You need need to be fit though but good walking tour."
229,5.0,Very cultural place to visit and envision how it was during the era of dynasties.  Would recommend visiting this massive palace
230,4.0,"Very attractive palace buildings with interesting architecture and interiors making a pleasant change from temple visiting. But don't expect to have the place to yourself. It was very busy, but this added to the character as many were in national costumes.Due to time restraints we were not able to visit the secret garden, which is a shame as photos we have seen make it look well worth visiting too.Would recommend having a local guide to make the most of your visit as there is much to understand."
231,4.0,"Interesting palace, and different from the others in the vicinity. As we entered two volunteers offered to give us an English guided tour, which was really interesting. We didn't get to see the secret garden unfortunately - an excuse to go back!"
232,5.0,Beautiful views! A must see if you're in Seoul. The exchange of the guards was a sight to see! Fun for everyone not just for kids.
233,4.0,"Interesting, and one needs some time to plan out your journey to these tourist attraction spots.  But then, one must prepare to do some walking on foot.  Mindful of the day of the week that some of these places may be closed to visitors."
234,4.0,"For me, visiting Seoul has been a lot of hustle and bustle.  The Palace and Gardens were still very busy but visiting provided a but of respite from the crowds of Insadong.Changdeokgung is one of four palaces (plus a shrine) in the area but is the only one that has a separate tour of the gardens.  The secret garden area is by tour only (large groups-limited to 100 per tour) and they have different times with different languages.  For entrance plus the garden tour it is 8000 won, but for only 10,000 won you can get a palace pass to visit the other 4 locations within 3 months of purchase.  Definitely get the pass!  The other four locations included are Gyeonbokgung palace, Changgyeonggung palace, Deoksung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine.My husband and I went on an afternoon English tour on a Saturday afternoon.  The guide provided insight into how the royal family lived and used each of the buildings within the garden area and spoke english very clearly.  The fall foliage makes it an excellent time to visit the gardens with a wide variety of trees changing. I believe the tour lasts about an hour and a half and does have steep hills to walk up.Other than the garden tour, the palace is mostly just open space.  The buildings themselves are beautiful and historically interesting, but there isn't a whole lot going on other than the buildings themselves.  You will likely see many visitors dressed up in traditional Korean Hanbok taking photos within the palace.  If you'd like, any places in the area rent these (I know I saw a few in the Insadong market)My favorite thing about visiting the palaces is that they are literally right in the middle of the city.  The city grew around the palaces so it is an interesting juxtaposition of the old and new.  Definitely worth a visit- if you have to choose just one palace I'd pick Changdeokgung.By Metro get off at Anguk Station and follow exit signs for ""Changdeokgung Palace"" When you exit, continue straight a few blocks and you'll walk right into it on your left."
235,5.0,"One of the 5 big palaces in Seoul. For me the best one. Its strongly recommended to buy combined ticket for all the palaces (5) - 10 000 W and try the guided tour. Its free, all guides speak fluent english and explain all that you can see. There are separate tours for palace and the secret garden. There are separate tickets for palace and secret garden (unless you buy combined ticket - then you have it all in one)."
236,4.0,"Spent a few hours wandering the gardens and buildings of this site - not as 'big' as its brother down the road, but I thought the gardens were better to view. Autumn was stunning in the colour changes and there was certainly plenty to see and do. Well worth it."
237,4.0,"We visit this palace on October. It was very beautiful, but they say it will be 100 times better in the fall (late October to November) when all the leaves turn to yellow. Prepare to walk a lot as this place is very big"
238,5.0,"At 10am promptly every morning you can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Colorful, and not too crowded, we thoroughly enjoyed the pomp and ceremony. Lots of youngsters wearing national costume to the event ( apparently you can rent them nearby for a couple of hours for a small fee and entry to the Palace will then be free), and lots of buses dropping off groups of school children. Well worth a visit."
239,4.0,"The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However, it's a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll (5000Won per entry) We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience."
240,5.0,The palace is a great place to see Korean history.  There is a changing of the guard that is a must see.  Don't know if they are there all the time but there were kids dressed in traditional clothes.  Fun to take pics with.  There is an entrance fee into the back of the grounds.  Did not have the time so did not go in further.  A must see!
241,4.0,"The palace is actually a complex of buildings which is very nice to visit. Inside there is an additional palace for which an extra ticket is required. I had not planned to visit it and indeed did not. Inside there is also the Secret Garden, also additional ticket. I took it and was not impressed. Would recommend to skip."
242,5.0,"I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews, there are many secret garden tours available, including 4 per day in English (this depends on the time of year; see the palace website for full details). Currently, the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100, this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11:15 for the 11:30 tour. As for the palace itself, very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I've seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement, much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time (90 minutes). The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size, but you're free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing."
243,3.0,"Was expecting more I guess, but the Secret garden is really just a park, not much of a garden. Didn't find it worth the time."
244,3.0,"Maybe, there is no fun if there is no interest in Korean films.I do not know whether there is worth a look to pay money.Chinese and does Mase Japanese city council."
245,2.0,"This review is the Palace only, we have not been to the Secret Garden, which looks better.  Perhaps I'm a cultural / history heathen or jaded from too many palaces, but I found this palace bland.  It was like a virtual reality, a blank canvas waiting for action and features.  It was also very similar to the Gyeonbok PalaceFor me it was a modern building, a replica of something that may have been on the site. It would have also benefited from some grass."
246,5.0,"Unfortunately I came over too early in Autumn. The leaves were still green and didnt get to see the red fall leaves season which would have made it more beautiful. To join huwon secret garden tour, head to the secret garden counter to buy the tickets separately for a set tour time. the tour is availabe in english, korean, japanese and chinese. normally, you can only go in with a tour. But this time they allowed visitors to roam away from the tour group giving more time and privacy to take selfies without the crowd in the background. Changdeokgung palace itself was pretty impressive especially if u watch a lot of period K-Dramas. More impressive than Gyeongbokgung palace in my opinion. If you're planning to visit all the palaces and huwon secret garden tour, do get the combination passes for only 10,000won. More value in my opinion."
247,4.0,"We visited this Palace first and glad we did so as Gyeongbokgung Palace is more impressive.   Entrance fee is 3000 won and does not include entry into the secret garden.   However as we did not want a guided tour for 90 minutes we didn't pay for this.   There is a Palace bundle for 10,000 won if you were looking to go to Gyeongbokgung and 2 other palaces.   Entry is free for those in traditional Korean outfits and it was nice to see so many dressed in these outfits. The Palace was rebuilt so it looks in good condition and modernish.  It is a good place to while away an hour or two and get an idea of the history at a very cheap price."
248,5.0,"Palace was a nice structure with peaceful,grounds. Not exactly ancient but does show the character and shows the pan Asian fertilization"
249,3.0,"The palace complex was not too big compare to gyeongbokgung. There are too type of entrance. The palace entrance fee didnt include the garden entrance fee, we have to pay additional fee to enter the garden. The throne room was kinda similar with one in gyeongbokgung, but the inner quarter of the king design with western probably victorian style. The complex mostly redecorated during the reign of the last king of joseon...it was easy to reach...the anguk station was 200 meter from the changdeokgungThey also offered a bundle ticket for this palace together with 2 other palace (gyeongbokgung and 1 other palace, i forgot) for 10.000W"
250,4.0,"Well preserved and in good balance with nature and city, you should visit it.Take care to not come when schools are present."
251,5.0,"It was smaller than Gyeongbok palace, which I love more than itBecause it's cozy and has more tree and good ambiance! Especially behind the palace complex, there's rear garden which was really beatiful! Eventhough it's quite long walk with special  tour guide working in Changdeok palace, it's worth to do it!"
252,4.0,"Different to Gyeongbukgung Palace, in that the architecture seems less grand and imposing, but still worth visiting for its beautiful grounds. The gardens within the grounds are lush and beautiful & I would recommend buying the inexpensive guide book from the front gate if you can't make the tour times."
253,4.0,"The real attraction of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden.  The palace itself was not as fascinating to us as Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung which had costumed actors on site and changing of the guard pageantry.  We visited Changdeokgung on a Sunday morning.  No performers were in costume, although quite a few locals visiting were in colorful traditional Korean attire.An English-speaking guide took us on a tour of the buildings which were interesting, but the Secret Garden tour was the real attraction.  It's best to make reservations at least 24 hours in advance for the Secret Garden tour.  We managed to see the palace grounds at 10:30am, followed immediately by the garden tour at 11:30am.  The walled garden is beautifully landscaped with water features, trees, flowers, and Korean-style buildings and pagodas.  The royal family spent their leisure time here, so every aspect of the garden is well-planned.  The first 45 minutes of the walk is easy, the second half apparently ""more athletic"" we were told by the guide, so we decided to take it easy at go back at the halfway point.  Cost is 3,000 KRW for the palace and 5,000 KRW for the garden."
254,5.0,"There are a few palaces in Seoul. This palace is near some other places of interest such as Bukchon village and Insadong. So, why would we skip this when we were also visiting other attractions nearby?"
255,4.0,Interesting tour but be sure to have a guide if you want to get the most out of it.  Lots of teens wearing traditional clothes that like having their picture taken.
256,3.0,"We spent hours walking around to see where the King lived and where his wife lived, etc.!  Beautiful architecture, but no furniture to mention or much else."
257,3.0,500 years old palace mainly  made from wood. Amazing Korean  design with beautiful colours. It is recommended to visi Changdeokgung palace
258,4.0,"It was interesting to visit the palace at night, but the number of lit up places was very limited. I wish I had gone there during the day instead."
259,3.0,"Nice structures, but a recreation that is only about 15 years old.  So the King never sleep here, not have the buildings ever been truly occupied."
260,5.0,"A great day out for wandering through Korean history. We bought the multi-venue ticket which allowed us to visit this palace, including the secret garden, the Jongmyo Shrine, Changgyeonggung Palace, Gyeongokgung Palace and Deoksugung Palace. It cost 10,000 Won. It's worth it if you are going to visit all the places as it costs about 3000 to visit each palace and 1000 to visit the shrine on individual tickets. The grounds are fairly large and we spent the whole morning there. We also visited the secret garden which is lovely but as its only at certain times there were a lot of people and I would have liked to have spent more time there. If you have the ticket book, you can access the Changgyeonggung Palace from this one and save yourself the long walk around to the entrance on the other side. This access is near where the secret garden tour starts. If you haven't got a ticket, there is a ticket booth there so you can still get in."
261,3.0,"This palace is more laid back and cozy, make sure 1- you visit the secret garden (it has a separate ticket)2- you go with the free tour provided, check the timing before you go"
262,5.0,"A great place to visit in Central Seoul (right by City Hall). The changing of the gate guard is worth seeing, so check what time it will occur."
263,5.0,The tour of the Secret Garden was absolutely beautiful. I really recommend to book ahead for this tour. The guide was really nice and professional as it was 27 degrees C and she was wearing hanbok on top of her normal clothes and still managed to smile and made few jokes. She recommend people to see this palace in autumn where leaves turn to orange which will make it even more beautiful.

Nice Palace to visit, but i would think mayb winter and autumn would b the best to visit, summer is hummer and steaming, it would b a long walk during the tour, so ols have a comfy shoes."
265,5.0,If you are in Seoul this is a must go to spot.Stunningly beautiful and peaceful with jaw dropping sights around every corner.
266,4.0,We visited Changdeokgung Palace after a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace in the morning.  They are very different and unique in their own way.  I personally prefer the Changedeokgung more due to the Secret Garden.  You can only visit the secret garden by joining the guided tour.  I would recommend that you book the ticket via its website in advance to avoid disappointment.  It's an hour and a half tour and it's a pity that one is not allowed to stay and explore more after the tour.
267,4.0,It was raining the day we visited but still a good time and worth having a look and learning the history.
268,5.0,"we signed up 2 months early for this limited evening full moon 2 hour tour only offered 2 days per month in the summer for foreigners. strolling thru the palace at dusk and then through the gardens at night and watching performers play traditional Korean music, dress in traditional costumes and sing folk songs was extremely worthwhile..while getting tickets was a somewhat complicated process involving registering on a website and then returning to purchase the tickets, whatever hoops you need to jump through are worth it. bring insect repellent though."
269,5.0,"My fiancée and I visited this palace on a Sunday afternoon.The sheer size of the palace is quite impressive and it is well worth the 3 000 won entrance fee. We also wanted to experience the secret garden, however access to the garden is restricted to guided tours only, and the tour time table did not fit with our time schedule.Opening hours (palace & secret garden) is from 09:00. Closing time varies between 16:30 to 18:00 depending on the time of year. Closed on Mondays.Guided tours (in English) to the secret garden is at:11:3013:3014:3015:30English speaking guided tours are offered only between February and October.Guided tours in English to the palace area are at 10:30 and 14:30 only.Fees for the palace area is 3000 / 1500 won for adults / children, while fees for the secret garden (palace area included) are 8000 / 4000 won for adults / children. Seniors (over 65 years of age) pay 5000 won.My fiancée and I found our visit to be a rewarding experience and we would not hesitate recommending it as an attraction."
270,5.0,"The secret gardens make this tour worth it. Even though it is ranked higher, we thought this palace was better than Gyeongbukgung Palace. The tour was 1.5 hours and I thought I would get bored--not a chance. Every 5 mins we were on to a different area with a new story. It was amazing."
271,5.0,"It is one of the 'Five Grand Palaces' built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty (1392––1897). It was heavily damaged during the Japanese Occupation of Korea (1910––1945). It was the site of the royal court and the seat of government until 1868. Korea's last Emperor Sunjong, lived here until his death in 1926. Currently, only about 30% of the pre-Japanese structures survive and consist of 13 buildings remaining on the palace grounds and 28 pavilions in the gardens, occupying 110 acres. This palace is extremely beautiful and well kept.  It is a pleasure to see how Koreans have gone to great length to preserve their history."
272,5.0,"You buy a ticket and join a group tour in your language - English, Korean, Chinese or Japanese. Exquisitely landscaped garden, quite a bit of up and down walking but plenty of opportunities to sit and reflect. So peaceful in the bustling heart of the city. Definitely one of my favourite places in Seoul and I would definitely go again."
273,4.0,"we joined a free english tour of the palace, run several times a day, which was very interesting, and added to our experience on the day."
274,4.0,"Sadly most of South Korea has been devastated by wars or fires, so most of the buildings of historical significance have undergone many renovations and rebuilds to present a picture of ""old life"".  The Changdeokgung Palace is a lovely place, which was originally built in 1405.  Full restoration work began in 1991 and continue today.  Many local young people visit wearing full traditional dress, which gives visitors a chance to take lovely photos."
275,5.0,"Not as grand as the Gyeongbokgung Palace but a more peaceful and calmer place. Unlike Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung wasn't completely destroyed by the Japanese and reconstructed, so it has a special serenity almost palpable.The real draw for me is the Secret Garden tour. This is the rest of the palace complex, about 60% of the total area. You have to book online in advance, and the slots for a tour in English go fast. We were fortunately to get 2 of the last 3 slots for a late morning tour.  The Secret Garden tour is quite a long walk across hilly terrain, but what a beautiful place! A royal refuge indeed. Pity the royal tombs were closed to conservation.My advice is to plan ahead and make your booking way in advance, and bring a good pair of hiking shoes."
276,3.0,Nice place to check out probably can do this in an hour and just check out the main palace without walking around everywhere as it gets a bit boring after an hr. I missed the changing of the guard if you can when the change guards will be a better experience
277,3.0,"For a royal palace this does seem a little stark, the buildings whilst undoubtedly historic are not noteworthy in themselves the roofing is impressive. Nice gardens at the top to wander around and it is a very peaceful spot. Worth a trip certainly but will not have you swooning in awe. Definitely take the special garden tour, the highlight."
278,3.0,"The palace itself was well kept, and manageable in size to visit. Nothing spectacular if you have already coming from China and went to the Forbidden City, for example, but if this is one of your first palaces, I think is worthy."
279,5.0,"Although the Palace itself is grand and worth visiting, what stood out was the Secret Garden. On a cloudy, breezy afternoon, meandering through the garden was delightful. But as there are only guided tours of the Secret Garden and a limited number of visitors are allowed each day, its best to book in advance. Can be easily done on the Changdeokgung Palace website. There are guided tours in different languages including English and Japanese."
280,5.0,"The tour of the palace is truly great, but the real gem is the Secret Garden tour.  Don' t miss it!  You may want to check before-hand, so you're not disappointed, but the Secret Garden tour runs only occasionally.  You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul."
281,5.0,"We did the Moonlight tour which only happens less than 10 times a year and I must say that the tour was an incredible experience, walking inside the palace at night with the light in the garden ... The secret garden during the night will be my best memory from Seoul."
282,5.0,Very beautiful and well kept the Koreans have gone to great detail to preserve what the great kings left. I found every detail worth the visit.
283,4.0,Somehow I thought a palace would be an inside tour. Not this one. It is all outside and on a hot day there is little shade. Since it is central you have to expect traffic snarls to get there.
284,3.0,"This palace was modified in the the 1920s by the King to include electricity and our guide showed us ramps that the King had built to accommodate his car and the Queen's car.  Though a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the modernization, though not readily apparent, rather ruins the historical perspective.  Still, interesting to visit."
285,5.0,This is a beautiful palace. I would highly recommend arriving early to be able to see the secret garden which gets fully booked really quickly.
286,4.0,"Never visited this palace before especially for my husband, daughter and son in law neve had a chance to see what is Korea or Asia. They only knew from the TV and megazines.It was very educational and opening visitor's eyes to different time and culture. I enjoyed for my family."
287,4.0,"10 minutes away by taxi from our hotel Myeongdong area, we purchased royal palace which we can use for several palace, secret garden was included.. worth a walk"
288,5.0,Wear a hanbok and get free entry to the palace! We enjoyed taking pictures in the palace. A must do is go online to book a guided tour to the secret garden. Although we had to pay for this but it is worth the time and money to enter this part of the palace.
289,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace offers a moonlight tour of the palace grounds for foreigners during the summer months on full moon nights. We booked the tour months in advance and it was worth every penny. The palace is beautiful but the only way to see the private (secret) gardens is to book a tour. We started the tour at the entrance gates where we were met by people dressed in traditional clothing. We were able to take pictures and then the tour began. We carried battery operated lanterns as we explored the grounds. Building and trees were lit so it was easy to navigate. As we walked the palace, performers played traditional instruments and folk songs in the background. It was quite romantic and magical to hear the music and imagine yourself wondering the grounds in dynasty times. The tour lead to a performance stage where traditional sweets and plum or cinnamon tea was served. We then watched several traditional performances that were beautiful. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and earpieces were provided so it was very easy to hear while on the tour. This is defiantly worth the money and it is must see in Korea. There is a lot of walking involved on the tour so wear comfortable shoes."
290,3.0,"One person's opinion: I have seen better Asian palaces. Changdeokgung — also known as Changdeokgung Palace  — is set within a large park in Seoul. It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces"" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty, but I do not think it was grand.This visit was part of a cruise ship 2 place tour; we booked it because we were afraid to take cabs from the Incheon port to the palace in Seoul - because of traffic. There was a lot of traffic, for sure, but there was no time saving on a bus vs. a private cab. I would take a private cab from Incheon port into the palace, if I could do this journey again.Missed it: I did not see the Huwon gardens and I did not know it even existed. Behind the palace lies the 78-acre garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women. The garden incorporates a lotus pond, pavilions, and landscaped lawns, trees, and flowers. There are over 26,000 specimens of a hundred different species of trees in the garden and some of the trees behind the palace are over 300 years old. This was not part of the cruise ship tour, but should be part of any new tour."
291,4.0,"Another nice place to be getting out of the hustle and bustle of the city but you have to elbow your way past the throngs of tourists, especially the tour groups getting guided tours."
292,4.0,"It good to view and learn from others, especially, the history and culture. Worth to take a walk and enjoy the scenery."
293,4.0,I went twice to this palace. The palace ground is huge. Well-maintained corridors. It is free for the public on certain holidays. Check the official website. I rented a hanbok and therefore I got in for free.
294,5.0,"We took a half day walking tour that included the old town and the palace.  The architectural features of the palace and the history, along with stories of the royal family, made this a must see."
