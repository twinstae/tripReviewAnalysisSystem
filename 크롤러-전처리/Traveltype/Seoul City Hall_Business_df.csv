0,5.0,"This transparent building, resembling a tidal wave, is one of most disputed constructions in Seoul, as it does not blend in with the original city hall building (located in the front, now a library). But still, it is a cool building to take a look at."

2,5.0,"A reflection of how Seoul wanted to make the city modern, globally competitive and environmentally friendly. This place is a must see!"
3,4.0,"The city hall consists of both the old building and the new building (just behind the old building).  It is open for visit, though I did not visit the interior since it was close at the time I wanted to visit.  There seems to be different exhibitions going on most of the time reflecting the different Korean arts and culture and history.   Entrance is free."
