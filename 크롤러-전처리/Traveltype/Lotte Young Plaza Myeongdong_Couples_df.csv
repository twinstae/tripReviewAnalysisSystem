0,4.0,"If you have liked basement food courts in some of tokyo’s department stores, this place will bring you back there. Lots of dine in and takeaway selections. I quite enjoyed it."
1,3.0,"The one thing worth mentioning about this store is that it has some shops specifically for youngsters and the young at heart. Rather than a mall of different retailers, this appears to be all Lotte, which didn’t feel like great value"
2,3.0,"As the name implies, this is a mall targetting specifically the young people. It is just across the main Lotte Department Store. Unless you are in the young people category, suggest just skip this place & go directly to the much bigger & more diversified main store instead. But since already at Lotte main store - just for curiosity sake, you could perhaps just pop into the ground floor of this Young Plaza  to have an idea of what it is ( like what we did)."
3,3.0,"Lotte Young building is quite big but the stores are small.  It is the characteristics of the shopping malls in Korea.  Most of the stores sell clothing and accessories for young girls / ladies.  It depends on your age, some people may not find it interesting."
4,3.0,Just a mall... not very big... free wifi... located at myeongdong shopping street.... you may visit if you have time or you can skip without regrets.
