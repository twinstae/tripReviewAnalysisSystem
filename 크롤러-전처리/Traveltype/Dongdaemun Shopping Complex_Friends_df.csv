0,4.0,One of the more popular place in Seoul to shop with a huge range of trendy clothes and accessories. The products are getting more expensive as compared to the previous years but we are still able to find some good bargains around. The huge malls consists of various small and compact shops and a few hours is needed to cover all levels. Most of the shops are also opened till quite late and there are also night buses to take if you miss the last train back to your accomodation.
1,4.0,"Been here in year 2000 , this is my 2nd time , things have change so much since then . Hyundai shopping complex was new,Doota opens till 5am , Dongdaemun design plaza was futuristic, you need at least 1 whole day to shop ."
2,4.0,find your everything here ha3... a huge shopping area. lots of mall. spend whole day to enjoy each mallin upper floor of dotta mall theres a souvenir shops.at basement floor of dotta mall theres a reasonable price of food court
3,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a haven for shoppers! There are 4 shopping complexes - Doota, Migliore, AM/PM, Good Morning Complex. Doota is 8 floors of mid range stores. The other 3 shopping complexes comprises of numerous tiny stalls offering great bargains for clothes, shores and accessories. Some days, these complexes open till 3-4am. Easy access by subway. Get off at Dongdaemun station."
4,5.0,"Similar to the orchard road in Singapore, this one however opens till late at night and you are able to bargain for clothes. Some clothes are cheap. Many malls close to each other so you can go from cheap to expensive shops, then take the cab back if its too late"
5,5.0,Huge shopping complex. People selling all kinds of things. Got a nice jacket for a good price. Would come back
6,4.0,"There are a lot of shops that look similar or sell the same products:-- winter jackets (what else when you go in November)- winter fashion (a little mumsy fashion wise)- winter accessories- bags and luggagePrices are good, and bargain-able."
7,5.0,It's so big awesome area to go shopping with many branches from worldwide branches to original Korean branches.Special that you can shopping over night too :)
8,1.0,"There are many places to shop in Seoul, coming to the shopping malls at Dongdaemun is the worst because everything is double or triple the price of other shops outside and the sellers are generally rude and always trying to rip their customers off as much as possible.Your time and money is better spent elsewhere."
9,3.0,Definitely would be a shopaholics' heaven where you can go shopping whenever you feel like. However only for people who has a bit more in their piggy bank.
10,4.0,"There are so many things to do in Seoul : exploring the historical relics like palaces, temples , enjoying the various Korean cuisines, food marts , kimchi museum,.. Therefore,a typical efficient time-starved traveller would like to allocate the late nights to shopping. Dongdaemun is a budget shoppers' paradise with many malls owning from late afternoons to early hours of the morning. Serving the local distributors,  the malls sell clothings and accessories items, has 4-5 floors with occasional late night cafes as well. However these strict rules apply: Purchase of at least 2-3 pieces of the same design, no trying allowed,  paying by cash only. The prices of the fashion items vary depending on the quality and varies from   8000 to 50,000 won a piece. Overall a great place for women shoppers."
11,3.0,"Its a shopholic paradise where there are more than 10 blocks of shopping complex, small shops, outlets including discount department store.  The only problem is its spread over a wide area.  Its advisable to bring a trolley bag if you plan to shop.  Items are cheaper than Myeongdong but you need to walk, look and check prices for what you want to buy.  Very much a love hate experience.  Suggest to start the day shopping and end with evening admiring the LED lights display at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a stunning visual piece of architecture."
12,5.0,"This is a bargain-hunters dream. You need stamina, cash, and a large shopping bag because almost anything you can imagine is sold in these markets. Brush up on your Korean for 'how much' and 'thank you' and enjoy the whole experience. Traders are not pushy and they are always willing to help. All of the sellers of particular items are in one section: hats, scarves and gloves are all in one area, socks are in another, jackets are in another, furs in yet another. Check opening and closing times - some areas do not open until midnight. Be prepared to walk a lot because the complex is huge. One building had several floors of Christmas decorations - so amazing to walk through."
13,2.0,"I have visited Myeongdong, Dongdaemum & Namdaemun for my shopping in this trip & found Dongdaemum to be the most disappointing. Maybe it's because I visited the place on a Sunday evening. Most of the shops are closed. Same goes to Pyeonghwa Market as well as the Dongdaemum Wholesale market in the area.The livelier part on a Sunday evening is located at Dongdaemum History & Culture Park station (Exit 13 or 14) rather than Dongdaemun station itself. The malls here are somewhat like Platinum Mall in Bangkok. But shopping here lacks the fun of street shopping available in Namdaemun or the variety of mask and cosmetic shops in Myeongdong. Its target market seems to be the low-mid range customers and bargaining is a must.So drop by if it is on the way and you have available free time to kill. Otherwise, visiting Myeongdong and Namdaemun would be sufficient for all your shopping needs."
14,4.0,"I went to this Dongdaemun Shopping Complex during my tour of Seoul, Korea and was faced with this three 6-storied buildings of mainly clothes shopping.  Each building caters to a different shopping class with the building to the far right (facing the buildings) the highest class, designer's fashion to the building on the far left selling the lowest class garments.  The lowest class by no means an indication of it's grade as they are just more common everyday wear compared to the highest class where you would find more dressy styles.  And all the buildings are opened from 10;00 a.m. until 4:30 A.M. (That's right, it's not a typo, it is A.M.)  This truly redefines ""shop til you drop"" in my mind..."
15,3.0,"We had lunch in one of the many indoor mall's food court upstairs & then allocated time to do some (windows) shoppping - we picked the mall with ""least expensive"" goods and realized that we can find better quality goods in the US for 50% less, even after haggling the prices down using calculators, as many of the sole store/counter sales people do NOT speak little, if any ,English at all - some are just rude & not friendly to tourists, no smiles or thank you.  Many of the same indoor stalls selling basically the same generic products, souvenir items and shoes/sneakers & luggage sets, etc. - if they won't accept for your counter-offered prices, keep walking & buy elsewhere. It's a neat & safe place to hangout on a rainy day and one can spend 2 or 3 days going from block to block, checking out different places & there are places to sit, clean restrooms & food with prices to match all budgets - plan ahead & have a local map. It's just one of those - been there, done it and had one's pictures taken for memories.And, the indoor malls don't have free WiFi that we can readily sign into - fine for the locals but for visitors, NOT good for business & we didn't come across any McD's or Starbucks, plenty of local equivalents - of course."
16,3.0,A little disappointed. We didn't buy anything inside the mall. But manage to grab some stuff outside the mall. Skip this if u don't have a lot of time in Seoul.
17,1.0,"If you do not like to haggle over overpriced clothes, AVOID this area at all cost. Not worth going at all. You get better prices for the same clothes without haggling at other shopping areas. More for wholesale suppliers."
18,4.0,"There are several buildings in this area. Each building consists of several levels with various goods to buy. If you have much time to spend here you can check up those buildings one by one, but if your time is just short then you can choose one and explore it. You can try Migliore or Good Morning. There you can find Korean made goods with good price, of course if you have a good bargaining skill, which is a must for a real spender :)You can find clothes, accessories, souvenirs, shoes, and many more. But if you are African or European or to put it simply if you have a bigger posture then normally Asian has then don't put your expectation too high. It is very difficult to find big size here. I have a little bigger shoe size then Korean. My size is like 245-250 (Korean size in mm) and they consider it as a big size. My African friends and some Asian-European friends can't find anything with size here. So just be prepared if your size is a big size.If you are staying for a long time here, you can even order shoes or clothes that you want when the sellers run out of your size. Please check the standard price for everything with some Korean you know before you go, so you can make a good deal here. Happy shopping! ^.^"
19,4.0,"Clothes are very fashionable. I will go back just to buy the cool (however, a little expensive) clothes.There's a souvenir shop at the 6th floor. The sales guy is cute and knows how to speak Filipino. 😆 The souvenirs are reasonable!"
20,3.0,"This place is so big it's easy to get confused. I found it very good if you are looking for clothes but not so great for souvenirs. It can become a madhouse with crowds but if you are into fashion, etc, this is a MUST DO"
21,2.0,"You can find some cool Korean fashion here if you look, but 90% of this is cheap clothing shipped from Chinese factories, just like you will find in many of the markets in China that look like this. Everywhere you can bargain, even if they say you can't bargain you can. Tell them you want to buy 2-3 items and then tell them the new price for all 3, then change say you only want 1 item and tell them lower price. All places will give you discount for cash as well so that they don't have to pay taxes. There are a few different buildings all selling clothes, some are very cheap with everything around 10-20k others have most things like dresses going for 30-60k (after bargaining)."
22,5.0,"If you love shopping then add this to your must-do list. Koreans DO NOT SLEEP. I’m not going to lie, it was a little overwhelming. The area was just so huge that it took us a good 3 nights to fully explore and shop. They are open super late, had super cheap clothes and souvenir items for sale (some knock-offs), and best of all they had cheap food! This seem to be the place where many locals would travel to sober up after a long night."
23,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a huge area with many buildings selling mainly clothes for ladies. The few buildings often visited by travelers are:1. Lotte FITIN: my favorite, it even provides free wifi. You can process your Global Tax Refund on 8th floor, that will save you some time in the airport.2. Good Morning City: not many shops open. There is a popular Korea sauna/spa called Sparex which is worth visiting. Try the body scrub.3. Hello apM4. Migliore: good shopping5. Doosan Tower: Korean local designers clothes, merchandise here are more expensive-Typical operating hours: 10:30am - 5am, best to visit after wholesale market opens full swing at night, from ~10pm. Some places are closed on Mon/Tue.- Quality of the clothes vary. Compare prices before buying as you may see some clothes repeated at other shops. Bargaining in expected (up to 20%), also ask if there is discount if you pay cash.  Note that some shops don’t allow trying.- There are many eateries/street stalls selling.  Try 1 of the grilled meat joints, specialty for Korea.- Dongdaemun Design Plaza, DDP is a unique architecture designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid, DDP.  Check out if you have time.With so many places to visit, you can easily spend days and still not able to cover all."
24,4.0,"I went twice at night and proceeded straight to Doota shopping mall. No bargaining allowed in this mall and the items are not cheap, but I still managed to find some nice items here. At B2 of the mall, you can get tax refund by cash if you use your credit card as guarantee. However, you will still need to get customs stamp on your receipt at the airport. The mall counter staff will advise you on the procedures accordingly. There are other malls at the area to cater to different budgets."
25,4.0,"There are lot of malls around selling things like clothings, shoes, bags, accessories and many more. Lots of styles to choose from but some of the products are quite pricy. Think and choose carefully before buying. It is possible to bargain on the price. Some of the retailers can speak english, chinese and japanese, so it is easy to communicate."
26,3.0,There are plenty of shopping there but some of the wholesale centre are more suitable for elderly. The ones that are more suitable for young people opens at 8pm so do take note. Dota is nice but the things are pricey.
27,3.0,"The complex is massive with many different vendors inside. After a while everything starts to look the same and you find yourself overwhelmed with items. Mostly women's clothing, shoes, and accessories you will find here, but, many of the clothing is ""one size fits all"" which is ridiculous if you don't have the Asian figure. I found it to be quite expensive for the quality of clothing and it wasn't even name brand. While not a complete waste of time to check it out, don't expect to walk away with cheap bags of items either. Be prepared to haggle well. If you love shopping this might be your haven."
28,3.0,"There were quite a few shopping malls there. One was like bangkok platinum mall, where there were 5 floors of stores. Mostly selling female clothing. Didnt really get to see much of male clothing. Didnt spend so much time there also as weather was super cold there."
29,5.0,"This place is filled with different types of shooed and malls for any budget. Most of the stores are right across the art hall. It's a great place to shop. This is another area where you can bargain for cheaper prices but only do this at the small shops, not at the shopping malls."
30,3.0,"This area is mainly dedicated for shoppers, as it is packed with different malls, in tall modern buildings. They look nice at night.Since we're not interested too much with shopping, we found this area less interesting than Myeong Dong, which had pedestrian streets.It's a good place to buy souvenirs. There's a Tourist Information booth on the main street, and they helped us there to find a store that sells souvenir plates.One thing that is beautiful there and will appeal to non-shoppers too is the Dongdaemun Stadium. It is shaped like a spaceship and is illuminated very nicely at night. We also went ""inside"" the complex and it's beautiful there too. From there you can also enter the subway."
31,4.0,"I came to this place around 6 PM, I directly went to 2nd floor to purchase some souvenirs. You can find any Korean souvenirs such as key holder, plate, fridge magnet, wallet, t-shirt, dolls, chop stick, post card and any others traditional souvenirs. Surprisingly the owner and employee of this shop can speak Indonesian fluently. They also accept Indonesia USD and Won currencies. The prices is the cheapest compared to other shop in Myeongdong. If we purchase 10 pcs of any souvenirs then we will get 11 pcs, 1 is for free.In this shopping center we also can buy for local designer clothes, but the price is more expensive if compared to those of global designer brands. So I only purchased some souvenirs in this place"
32,3.0,"I went to Dongdaemun because I am totally into crafts, sewing, fabrics etc. Well, the experience was quite traumatic. On the one side you may rejoice at the sight of trillions of ribbons, buttons and fabrics, then you realise that  hardly any price is on display and that the sellers will make up some price just for you and will try to rip you off. In addition, inside the building, in spite of the air con, it gets extremely busy, sticky and claustrophobic, with people constantly shouting (it seems that they are unable to speak in a normal tone of voice) and pushing you around. I made some purchases but I was happy to leave the building and that total mess after some 2 hours. By the way, I haven't found anything that you cannot find and buy back at home or on Ebay, for less and with less stress."
33,4.0,"It is a huge shopping complex and it felt like a maze inside. There are many many shops selling fabric, lace, beads, threads, and all other kinds of things you would need for your needlework / jewelry / all sorts of crafts projects. You can go to the stalls selling street food which are just outside the shopping complex after finish shopping!"
34,3.0,"Dongdaemun is popular for midnight shopping as their shopping malls opens till 2am. It's literally shop till you drop. They sell all sorts of items from clothings, to hats, to accessories, to shoes. Doota! is like a departmental stores with handmade or designer wear, if you exceed a certain amount you can get tax refund.Tips: It is very easy to lose track of time when you simply walk in and out of a shop/malls. I missed the public transport and have to taxi back and most taxi uncle doesn't want to go by metre so we got a costly ride back to the hotel.Check out my Korea trip at http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/03/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-2.html"
35,5.0,"If you are a shopaholic, pick a hotel within this area so you can easily return to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning, or return to the hotel to keep your stuff, and then go out shopping again.Though some shops opened earlier, I would recommend visiting this place from 7pm onwards. Most shops only closed at 2-4am. The place is clustered with malls meant for retailers and consumers. If you are not a retailer, you can get great bargains at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore. Make sure you bring cash as you pay cheaper by cash instead of credit card. There are 2 higher-end looking malls nearby - Doota and Lotte Fitin which accepts credit card. There are cafes / food courts in both Doota and Lotte Fitin. Lotte Fitin closes earlier than the rest of the malls. I like Migliore the best among all as they have better clothes designs. You can get clothes on sale from KRW4,000 onwards. New designs are more expensive at KRW30,000 onwards. You can try the clothes / pants but there are no fitting rooms. You might be tempted to buy flashy shoes at these places (Good Morning City, APN and Migliore) but they don't feel that comfortable to wear. I got a similar looking pair from Doota instead at KRW78,000 with better lining. Some flats (shoes) sold at Good Morning City, APN and Migliore are comfortable though and costs only KRW10,000. Migliore was closed when we were there on a Monday while Good Morning City and APN were opened. On Tuesday, Migliore was opened but Good Morning City and APN were both closed. Not sure if this is the norm. In any case, when either malls were closed, there are still may vendors selling clothes / shoes / bags outside these malls. The quality / workmanship of items sold here are excellent. I bought some clothes here 2 years ago and after many washes they still look new. Try to bargain before you buy as I noticed some items sold here are few thousand won more expensive than the ones sold at Itaewon area and Gangnam Underground Shopping Mall."
36,4.0,"I used to recommend  Doota, Migliore, and other buildings for shopping to my friends. However, personally I do not buy there even though I admit their designs are pretty good and very "" a la mode"". But today I found another building named, ""Jeil Pyeonghwa market"" where I could find more varieties and very fashionable goods. I certainly take my friends to this place than any other shopping places in Seoul."
37,4.0,Doota Mall is located in Dongdaemun area along with Dongdaemun market where you can get things at a cheap price if you have good bargaining skills. If you are not good at bargaining. You could go to mall directly. The whole mall embraces all kinds of garments from local brand. The girls would love this place and spend several hours on shopping. You can also find some food from food court area in B1. Actually it's better to taking a break than taking a meal.
38,4.0,"Also known as “Doosan Tower”, Doota Mall is located in Dongdaemun (the East Gate of old Seoul) along with the popular Dongdaemun market where you can get things at a cheap price if you have good bargaining skills. We were not that adventurous that day so we decided to just hang out at the mall instead.After alighting at the Dongdaemun subway station, it was not that hard to locate Doota’s bright orange logo. The Dongdaemun area is akin to Bugis Street in Singapore, bustling with activity(cafes, restaurants, eateries and the like) and people out for a good bargain: having a market (within the vicinity) with makeshift stalls selling their wares (and even some bargaining to boot).Doota Shopping Mall consists of 10 floors, has high ceilings with mostly natural lighting (in the day) with cafes galore. To get to the 1st floor, you can enter through the entrance located there or simply take the escalator outside to get to B1. We started from B1 and made our way up. We spent the whole day in the mall exploring all the shops and  trying to control buying things on impluse (which was pretty much almost next to impossible). Do check out my blog for more on the shopping experience at Doota and photos! ^^"
39,4.0,"this place is near from Dongdaemun Gate, we arrived 1 am in the morning at Doota and amazed that still shopping mall open and many shopper from around the world is gathering here. from fake to original brand you can name it is available and the most interesting is Seoul young designer in 1st to 3rd floor ! but before you buy anything just make sure you walk around and ask the price from the same product :p the price some time a lot different from one store to another even with the same style and product so be smart :) in 5th floor is the palace for wallet and souvenirs, many souvenirs shop seller speak some south east asian and russian language, might be because so many Indonesian , Malaysian and Russian travels to Seoul. In the ground floor the collection seem stuck in the 80's ;p so if you want to have the Korean K PoP star may be 1st to 3rd level is your floor :) if you bored to shop inside mall just get out and so many stall selling product from cosmetic to fashion :) finally we out from this shopping mall at 4 am in the morning and still wonder why so many people still came and go from this mall like never sleep ;p"
40,2.0,"Went to Doota which is recommended even by the korean tourism board. I had expected that since it is more upmarket and it boasts to be a designer-wear complex, i would get value-for-money kind of clothing. I didn't mind paying if it's a designer-wear. Hence, I paid krw $89000 for a dress. However to my surprise, I saw the same dress made with the same material but with a different label going for just krw $65000 1 floor below. Oh my gosh! So much for a tourist complex that boast of designer-wears and do not allow bargaining! It felt more like mass-production. The consolation was that the salesgirl was willing to give us back the price difference between the 2 shops: something that probably would not happen in other places. By the way, the same dress was selling for krw $50000 in the building just across the busy main road. Lesson to be learnt: Do try to look around and compare prices before buying clothes in the area. You are bound to find the same piece going for different prices. And don't be tricked by the word 'designer-wear'."
41,5.0,a good place to find souveniers and pretty much anything else. All kinds of Korean snack stalls. A fun way to spend the day
42,4.0,"in here you have to look out for your wallet since you can stop buying things..hahaha. Actually the price a bit expensive, but the seller always say, this is made in korea...and i admit, all the items was so fashionable...you can't take your eyes on it, the shoes, the bags, the coats, lasting you know you have already full with shopping bags..."
43,4.0,"At Dongdaemun Shopping Complex, you'll never know the time of day - because this complex opens till 5am everyday! There are some good bargains too. It's not too expensive to get a cab back and forth to your hotel (we stayed pretty far but it didnt cost much). Just beware of the ""Van Taxi"" though! Dont ever get into that!"
44,5.0,"as a foreigner living in Korea and visiting several of the famous market/shopping areas, we often see things that are interesting and might be neat to buy, but so far we hadn't come across any one particular place where we immediately thought ""oh, we should do our clothes shopping here.""  Until Dongdaemun.  Dongdaemun is similar to some of the other huge famous markets like Insadong or Namdaemun, but different.  It's the one place so far that seemed to carry a huge selection of modern clothes similar to what all the Korean people are wearing.  The Dongdaemun area actually consists of a bunch of huge multistory shopping malls surrounded by the tiny little back alleys full of restaurants and street food vendors and street stalls selling clothes as well, so you can get all the fancy name brand stuff and clean restrooms inside the big buildings and then go find whatever kind of restaurant you want and on the way pick up fuzzy socks or hats or fake Louis Vuitton ties or handbags from the street stalls.Some of the other markets, like Namdaemun in particular, seemed to also have a big selection of the fake name brand handbags and wallets and so on, but you can get all the same stuff here at Dongdaemun.  Also, Dongdaemun is evidently open late into the night.  And I have heard that Dongdaemun is where a lot of businesses much farther outside of town buy their stuff wholesale; for example you can go to shops in Uijeongbu or Dongducheon and see the exact same shirts and jackets and pants and shoes for sale for 100,000 to 150,000 won that you see in Dongdaemun for like 30,000 to 50,000 won.  Just as an example, your mileage may vary but that's what it seemed like to us.  The street food seemed to have it's own particular unique quality as well; we definitely saw some of the same rice dumplings in spicy sauce for example that we've seen elsewhere, but they seemed to have certain particular things here that we didn't see at the other markets, like a giant ball of french fries welded together on a stick with a hot dog in the middle.   In other words, try to check out all the big markets because they all have their own unique character, but if you can only go one place and you need to buy nice looking modern clothes (albeit sized to fit Korean people), then Dongdaemun is the place to go."
