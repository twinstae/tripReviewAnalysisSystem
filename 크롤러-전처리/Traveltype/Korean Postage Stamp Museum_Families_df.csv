0,4.0,The museum is at the basement of the post building. Good to see the history of stamps in Korea and other stamps unique to other countries
1,3.0,This museum had an interesting exhibition of Korean cultural and historic stamps. The miniature exhibition of the various parts of the Korean Postal service was fascinating. Although it was informative the museum organization was better suited for small children.
2,5.0,"Welcome to Stamp World! Formerly the Korean stamp museum, Stamp World is a fun, interactive museum housed in the main post office in Seoul. Not only is it filled with historical information, but it is also an interactive fun place to go - especially for kids. There are wooden cutouts and puzzles and dolls and games to spark your imagination. It also has wonderful examples of different types of stamps available to the public. You can buy postcards there at the little gift counter. There is a table where you can write out your note and they can sell you stamps so you mail the card on the spot!â€¨Really fun place to spend a couple of hours."

Inside, you will see the history of stamps all over the world, not only in Korea; and samples from other countries, as well as extra-ordinary ones. There are nice games for children. You can also make a stamp of your selves by taking a photo there!"
