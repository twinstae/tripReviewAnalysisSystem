0,3.0,"I've been to the Frida Kahlo exhibit and the incorrectly titled - Picasso and Cubism exhibit (January 2019) at the Hangaram.  Hangaram museum does not have English docents (unlike Leeum) , English pamphlets or English descriptions of artwork.  The museum features important shows but is not interested in attracting anyone other than locals.  Most preposterous - The PIcasso & Cubism exhibit had as their piece de resistance - Picasso's Three Dancers from 1925 - not the original but a rug with the image!.  The marketing poster of the exhibit features this image giving the impression  that the exhibit would include the original and not a rug that has the licensed image.  Also, although the show was extremely impressive and featured a number of Delaunay's most important work- the curator really should have come up with a less misleading name for the show.  There was hardly any work by PIcasso and Braque."

So I called and booked the tickets over the phone. I guess the woman who helped me book them last month didn't understand what I wanted and booked us tickets for a morning concert, instead of The Nutcracker, on the same day. Upon discovery of the mistake, they were execptionally polite. But only had one pair of seats left at a price higher than we were hoping to pay. I certainly didn't expect them to give the ‚Ç©90 000 tickets to us for free...but certainly at a discounted price. I understand that it was mostly sold out, but COME ON! It was entirely their fault we had the wrong tickets and couldn't get the ones we wanted earlier. And they had seats available. Disappointing follow through on a customer service mistake."
2,5.0,"I went hear to listen to a chamber recital as part of the Goethe Institut of Korea's celebration.  The parking was very easy to access though I can see some accessibility issues for handicapped.  The smaller IBK Chamber Hall we went into was well designed - good acoustics, sightlines and acoustics.  The lobby has a small music store with a collection of good CDs and LPs for sale.  The outdoor grounds are pleasant as it is set against the mountainside."
3,5.0,"I had a lucky chance to visit the perfomance of ""Anna Karenina"" in Seoul Arts Center... 2 hours of pleasureüôÑ Even everything was in korean I understood each part because of amazing roles played by actors‚ù§ Thank you for such a good job!"
4,1.0,"Seoul Arts Center's English online reservation service has been unavailable for almost one year now. I have used this facility to buy my tickets for ballet performances - when ticket sales open there is a mad rush to get a seat in a good place in the theater, all the best seats have always gone before ticket sales open - I am told they go to the sponsors.Telephone bookings are not satisfactory - last time by the time the girl had slowly taken my details she then told me ""sorry the seats have gone now!"" seats were only available 8 rows further back! SAC - please reinstall the online bookings in English!"
5,4.0,"I have attended 2 events at the Seoul Arts center and have been impressed with the venue each time. The venue is well-organized with a spacious concert hall, well-marked and convenient restrooms, and several dining & snack options."
6,5.0,Many classical operas and modern musicals are on stage throughout the year.Many musicians also present their beautiful plays as well.
7,4.0,"With approx 3000 seat capacity, Seoul Arts Center's Opera Theater is considered one of the biggest halls for musical performances. I watched 2 shows - one seat was on the last row of the upper floor and one seat was on the ground floor (3rd row).  Even the upper floor seat provided a reasonably good experience as the stage was very big and wide. It was rainy evening and when the rain let up a little, we tried to get some dinner but there were not many kiosks selling food at all.  That was a big disappointment - lack of f&b choices"
8,4.0,"At this time, there is a musical, "" The 42th street Broadway musical"" It's Korea but all the actors and actress were so good. You would have fun with story even though you didn't understand the language."
9,5.0,"I attended a concert, Korea Symphony Night, there at the Concert Hall. The event was part of Rotary International Convention. The venue is very nice because there are different halls, shops, gallery, and coffee shops. It's recommended that you plan your transportation in advance because I had a tough time getting a taxi at night after the concert, especially with so many people competing for the limited number of available taxis. I would recommend that you attend an event there. Photos attached."
10,5.0,"We took in an orchestra concert while visiting Seoul and the Arts Center was impressive.  Multiple venues in this complex, including a ""dancing fountain"" set to show tunes.  Extremely nice facility."
11,5.0,"The concert hall is beautiful built with lot of capacity.Look for some events. It is pretty difficult to find taxi ,if you finished your concert at night as the nearest subway train station is a bit far."
12,4.0,"A multi-functional art and cultural complex at one site, consisting of Opera House & Concert Hall for performing arts, Art Museum and exhibition facilities for visual arts. I visited there for Design Art Fair 2016. Many local artists exhibited their creative art works, ranging from handicraft, design accessories to pop art objects. It was a very good taste of the latest design development in Korea. Highly recommend to check in advance if you find any interesting show/ exhibitions before you go as it is not very close to the center of the city."
13,5.0,"I am from NYC and love art, classical music and dance.  Seoul Arts Center is a great place to visit even if you don't have a ticket to a specific events.  The complex offers variety of live performances from concerts, plays. ballets and more.  You will often find performances by world renowned performers and companies.It's also a great place to hang out, have tea or eat and enjoy outdoors in a beautiful court yard with a fountain."
14,4.0,Simply beautiful. Its a pity that I only have few hours to tour this place. Would love to come back for another view.
15,5.0,"This is a beautiful opera house.  We saw the Nutcracker here and really enjoyed it.  If you have time, get there and see a show."
16,4.0,"Regular art exhibitions and performances are held in this place. Generally, an exhibition does not allow you to take photographs, and you have to place your bags and other valuable stuff inside a locker and remember the locker code. I found that the Munhwa Jeondang area where the art exhibitions are held is only 1/3 of the Arts Center, because there are also a musical hall for performance, an academy for the arts somewhere behind the Jeondang exhibition halls. A day is simply not enough for combing through all the various exhibitions, even if you are very ambitious, and I think that you will come back for more! The architecture is rather interesting, and combines Victorian and abstract modernist designs with Korean concepts."
17,4.0,"was here to see a show, and it turn out to be a highlight of my stay in Korea.drum cat show, was entertaining,. the story, the light and should too beyond expectation.."
18,4.0,A very interesting place to stroll around.  The cultural scene is vibrant and the structure is beautiful.  Worth to see it.
19,4.0,"Took a train and then took an idyllic 10 min to the Seoul Arts Centre.  There is also a shuttle bus from the train station if you can wait for it.  Otherwise, it is very easy to find by foot.  The Center is well planned and all the various sections are easy to find; which is important.  We managed to catch a great exhibition here (Kusama Yayoi) and it was good fun.   We liked the place so much, we came back in the evening to watch a ballet.  Would definitely recommend it to friends.  Our only dissapointment was that the Calligraphy Museum was closed and the people could not inform us when it would be open.  Otherwise, it was a good and enjoyable experience."
20,4.0,"Was here to watch the beautiful CARMEN opera and was very impressed with the Opera House, beautiful and comfortable seating - stores nearby, clean signs in english as well to tell you where to go, food places around for intermission"

22,5.0,Worth a visit! Many great exhibitions and shows available at this place. We went to see Kusama Yayoi's A Dream I Dreamed and loved it! Take subway to Nambu Bus Terminal then take a shuttle bus or local bus there.
23,5.0,"In my trip to Seoul six months ago. I was invited to Seoul Art center because acording to my friend, this is a perfect place for an art fan like me. I was so suprised because of it's architectural style, it looked like a  Korean royal traditional hat in a modern way. And inside is even more impressive: There are tons of events was held inside, exhibitions, music concerts, very excited. This is a good destination for tourists to explore korean culture."
24,4.0,"I went to Parsifal at the Seoul Arts Center last week and it was fantastic.  I have only ever been to concerts before but this venue for the opera was  wonderful,  the sound of the artists clear and easy to hear.   We also had great service from the restaurant downstairs - delicious  food and a reasonable price for such a place.   The buildings and architecture are impressive as well.    Its a fun place to go to for an event of any kind."
