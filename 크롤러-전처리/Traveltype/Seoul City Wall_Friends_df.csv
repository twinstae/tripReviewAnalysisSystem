3,5.0,"Since 600 years ago, Hanyangdoseong hugs the Seoul with the unique history, moments, people and many diaries. I got the second chance to visit this nice place with Funday Korea Networks. Thanks to them they provide a unique tour guide with presenting very interesting information about this wall. If you are visiting seoul don’t miss the opportunity to visit this historical charm in the heart of a modern city. Let’s see 5 most important reasons to visit this cool place:1: If you are a fan of hiking, you’d better try it at least once. You can experience the beauty of nature and dazzling view of Seoul. Beside I found a group named: CIK (Climbing in Korea) which offers very interesting programs for those who love hiking. (you can check it at meetup application). The Baegak Mountain would be not only the best hiking trails of Seoul City Wall but also you can find a 200-years old pine tree there. It is not famous only because of its age, in fact this tree bears the traces of 15 bullets in the gun battle between the South Korean military and police with the North Korean Special Forces unit who came to attack Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House) on 21 January 1968.2. You will be amazed by the huge effort of many people for construction of this wall. It is one the greatest historical places in Korea with over 600 years background. I recommend to go with a tour guide, or at least check more details on the historical background and the stories of its building. Since you well get a cool feeling while visiting there. That’s how I felt when I went there second time with the tour guide. Follow up funday programs, and if you are lucky you can visit that place again with them.3. Easy to access. The Seoul City Wall was originally surrounded Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). Afterward it was extended for 18.6km along the ranges of Bugaksan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Inwangsan Mountain. As a nice spot to start you can start from Hanyang Doseong. The Seoul City Wall consisted of 8 gates which but only six remain today. The North, South, East, and West gates of the wall are known as the “Four Great Gates” (Sukjeongmun, Heunginjimun, Sungnyemun, Dongeuimun). You can try either bus, subway or taxy in your convenience. The best way is to instal “naver map” in you mobile which offers searching in English as well, then try Dongdaemun (동대문 in korean).4. It is an architectural treasure and candidated for Unesco World Heritage status. the Great East Gate is one the architectural wonders. You can visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza there. You can find more information about the city’s efforts to have the wall designated as a World Heritage site. There has been sadly some destruction during years which effected some parts of the wall but the currently I appreciate they are carefully maintain this wall. You can see some white spot on the wall which looks like mushroom but actually they are some sensors for checking the wall status (movement, humidity, etc.)5. Last but not least, check the Seoul City Wall Museum which as a good news its free and you don’t have to pay for the entrance. You can see photos of old days, and find out even more about this unique wall there as a symbol of hardworking of Korean people. They also have nice presentation describing the origin of this wall. Thanks again FundayKorea for very interesting programs."
4,5.0,"Did you know that Seoul is surrounded by a wall for over 600 years? Thanks to Funday Korea Networks I got to know about the background of the Wall. The Seoul City Wall goes by the name of Hanyangdoseong and was built for defensive purposes. Today it is the longest wall of its kind in the world and is under state protection as Historic Site No. 10. If these facts are not enough to motivate you for a visit, then here are five more reasons why it is a must for everyone who comes to Seoul. 1. Historical significance: The Seoul City Wall was built in 1396, four years after King Taejo established the Joseon Dynast and moved the capital to Hanyang (modern-day Seoul). The fortress wall witnessed a number of rulers, the Japanese occupation and the Korean War, which makes the 600-year old city wall a major historical monument. The Seoul City Wall Museum provides great and detailed information of the Hanyangdoseong for everyone who wants to know it all. 2. Special architecture: The wall, just as the whole city, was planed in consideration of the natural topography, Confucian principles, and various political, economic, and military factors. It is built along the ridges of four mountains (Baekgaksan, Naksan, Mongmyeosan, Inwangsan) and has four main gates, which represent the four virtues of Confucianism, and four ancillary gates. Interestingly, the structure of the wall is not uniform, as the wall was repaired over the centuries. By seeing the stone shape, you can easily determine in which period the section was built. You can also look out for one of the 297 stones with inscriptions, which contain names of workers and dates of the repair. 3. Witness history: Besides the unique architecture that shows you different periods at once, you can witness modern history by visiting the Seoul City Wall. The Baegak Mountain trail is the perfect example for that. Public access to this area was omitted for about 40 years, after the “Blue House Raid”, where North Korean commandos tried to assassinate the South Korean president Park Chung-hee in 1968. The mountain is not only the highest within Hanyangdoseong, it also bears a 200-year old pine tree, which has fifteen bullets from the battle between South Korean police and the North Korean Special Forces. After presenting your ID you can visit this historic place.4. Hiking spot: As the Hanyangdoseong leads through the mountains, it is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy nature and a beautiful view of Seoul. There are different courses that that differ in difficulty and duration, so one can find the perfect trail for oneself. With a length of 18.627 kilometers, a complete tour of the wall would take about 10 hours. The track I participated in, started at the Seoul City Wall Museum near Dongdaemun station, covered the Naksan Mountain and ended in Hyehwa. While you can enjoy a breathtaking scenery of Seoul on your way, you will also discover a lot of unique spots like the artistic Iwha Mural Village, the Myogaksa Temple and Naksan Park. 5. Discover Seoul from anywhere: Because the wall embraces the old city center of Seoul, you can start or end your journey at any gate and you will be able to visit touristic places nearby. Donuimun Gate in the West for example is really close to Gyeonghuigung Palace and the Seoul Museum of History while the Sungnyemun Gate is close to Namdeamun Market, which is a historic marketplace and remained popular until today. I would highly recommend a visit to Hanyangdoseong, as it is right next to all the popular attractions. It does not matter which trail you choose, because you will be able to see Korean architecture through time, enjoy nature and discover various places near the City Wall."
5,5.0,"On March 16th I visited Hanyang Doseong , also know as Seoul city wall, thanks to Funday Korea Networks. The wall is around 18km long and we just visited the Naksan mountain part of the wall.(Naksan Mountain Course, Hanyang Doseong) Although it was not my first time visiting this place, getting to know the historical background of this place made it more special for. This tour was an amazing opportunity to learn more about not only the Seoul City Wall but also the history of Old Seoul. And now I will write just some of the reasons everyone needs to visit this place for sure.1. Being able to see something from Joseon Dynasty in the middle of Seoul, a modern city, is so fascinating, also up on the Naksan mountain you can see the Old Seoul City part of the modern Soul which the wall surrounded in the past2. By visiting the museum, you can see the process of building the wall and how the wall looked in each historical period. Also you can learn alot about the wall and Old Seoul.3.

The wall has many gates and one of the most beautiful ones is the Dongdaemun which you can visit if you come to Naksan mountain. Also Naksan park is so beautiful so you can enjoy your time there.It's so thoughtful of Korean people and government for trying to discover lost parts 9f the wall and for making it as a public place were people can visit.If you visited Seoul one day don't forget to visit this place as well and then write your own reasons for others to visit this place."
6,5.0,"I have just had a great day with my friends earlier this month walking along Hanyang Doseong, the Seoul City Wall thanks to Funday Korea Networks. It’s the first time I have seen Seoul with such a differently captivating and historical charm since I first came here 5 months ago. This place is definitely a must-go if you come to Seoul and here are 5 reasons why 😉1. Following the fortress wall, you can bathe in the splendid scenery. The wall which covering a total length of 18.6 km stretches along many of Seoul’s mountains, making a beautiful trails for everyone. But “the best view comes after the hardest climb”, if you keep walking up the hill or the high mountain, you will be rewarded with one of the most precious views of Seoul. I couldn’t make it last time but definitely will soon. I heard someone said that Seoul is a city of layer and after visiting the Seoul Wall, I deeply understand that. Up here at the hill, Seoul appears clearly with the combination of old and new building, old and new architecture, embracing the history behind it.2. In Hanyang Doseong, especially at the Seoul City Wall Museum which is free to visit, you can learn more about the wall’s deep rooted history. Thanks to Funday Korea Network, I had the oppotunities to hear a presentation showing the historical artifacts relating to the transformation of Hanyang Doseong along with the history of Seoul through times. The Seoul City Wall was originally built in 1396, surrounding Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty for defensive purposes. From times to times, it has become one of the symbolic places of this beautiful and historical city.3. As the wall was built along the range of 4 big mountains in Seoul, it is indeed a ideal place for hiking. The entire wall would take an entire day to walk but it is conveniently devided into parts by eight main gates, but now only six remain standing. Therefore, with a map and a planned route, you can easily finish the hiking along the wall while enjoying the wonderful scenery of Seoul.4. Hanyang Doseong also has many ideal spots for picnic. As mentioned before, I visited the wall ealier this month, the weather was still cold. But undoubtedly, I will come back here with my friends in a warm and sunny day because it is a perfect place to have a picnic, especially in Naksan Park. Remember to bring a camera, believe me, you will have a lot of lovely and spectacular photos here, just like what you have been seeing in many Korean dramas.5. Walking along the Hanyang Doseong, you can find many amazing hidden spots. In my trip, I passed by the beautiful village in Naksan Mountains called Ilhwa Mural Village. This village was transformed into a creative and artistic heaven with full of paintings and sculptures. I have searched about some hidden spots like this (Prison History Hall, Naksan Gallery, Baegaksan, Waryong Park...) and planning to visit them someday soon. That is just 5 of much more reasons why you should visit Hanyang Doseong. If you are planning to come to Seoul, make sure to check out this awesome place. And if you are here in Seoul, you need no hesitation to visit the wall, choose comfy clothes and shoes, bring some snack and you will have a best experience ever when in Korea. Don’t forget to bring your camera 😉"
7,5.0,"Having been in South Korea for more than 3 years, the Seoul City Wall is one of the landmarks I keep going back to, only to recently realize that it's because the experience is different every time. Therefore I compiled a short list on why every person visiting Seoul should have Hanyang Doseong on their itinerary.1.	Being built over 600 years ago, the Seoul City Wall is one of the oldest living proofs of Korean craftsmanship and hardwork. The different types of rocks used tell the story of its several restorations, of the people who built it and of the development of the South Korean society.2.	Stretching for 18.6 kilometers, the Seoul City Wall is the longest wall of its kind in the world.3.	Hanyang Doseong is not only a history lesson, but also a good workout, because going around its entire length will definitely test your stamina. However, don’t worry! You can choose only to the courses appropriate for your fitness level without missing much of what the wall has to offer.4.	Walking around the Seoul City Wall you can enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of the capital and admire the modern buildings in central Seoul, among which you can find little hidden temples and other historical structures.5.	Whether you like hiking and spending time away from the polluted city, or you are just looking for the most aesthetically-pleasing background for your next Instagram photo, just following the Seoul City Wall will take you to your desired destination."
8,5.0,"Having studied in Korea for more than 5 months, I’m luckily to have chances to discover this country, particularly know more and more interesting places in Seoul. Huge thanks to Funday Korea Network’s Hanyang Doseong Tour, I can know that among several modern architectures around Seoul, there was a place wear a special historical and antique color, named Hanyang Doseong or usually called Seoul City Wall, a treasure trove of city history, stands as proof of this.	So guys, here is 5 reasons why you should visit this amazing place 1. Abroadening your knowledge about Korean history 	Along the Seoul City Wall, there once stood eight gates that were built between 1396-1398, but only six remain standing. The North, South, East, and West gates of the wall are known as the “Four Great Gates” (Sukjeongmun, Heunginjimun, Sungnyemun, Dongeuimun), while the Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southwest gates are known as the “Four Minor Gates” (Changuimun, Hyehwamun, Gwanghuimun, Soeuimun). 	The main gates set up in the North, South, East and West are respectively named after “In” “Ui” “Ye” and “Ji”, which represent the four virtues of Confucianism.	The 5 virtues of a dutiful human being are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity, which a king ough to cultivate and possess “Ji” means “wise”, wisdom that knows which one is right or wrong; “Shin” means “reliable”, a mind that is reliable and trustful; “Ui” means “righteous”, a mind that feels ashamed of injustice; “In” means “generous”,  a mind that loves people.	Hanyang Doseong operated as a city wall for the capital of Joseon for 514 years, from 1396 until 1910, setting a world record. Hanyangdoseong, completed in 30 years, was torn down in many parts due to city planning initiatives and the introduction of trams lines. However, significant sections of the wall remain. The best-preserved and well-known course is the Wall of Mt. Bukaksan.2. Ideal place to “let your hair down”	This place is surrounded by many big trees and always having fresh air. The last time I visited it, I was kind of stress, I really appreciate Funday for coming to my mind at that time, for sending me email about this tour. Joining this tour, I felt relaxing a lot, I have met lots of people from all over the world and we’ve had great time.3. Helping to level up your “hiking skill” 	As far as I know, a 160 – lb or 73 – kg aldult male will consume 3,660 kcal by walking around the entire Seoul City Wall, which is equivalent to swimming for 8 consecutive hours. Which means that if you can conquer this wall, your physical health will definitely be better. Funny sayings that you can eat anything you want, then walk around Seoul City Wall, you’ll never have to worry about your weight [LOL].4. Taking impressive photos	Hm you can refer to my attached photos for your own opinion. For me, every corners of this place have made an impression to my heart, I have to say “wow” with every scence that I’ve seen. Sometimes I barely took photos cause I want to enjoy it with my pure mind and eyes, you know, our eyes are the best cameras in the world. But yah, if you’re fond of taking photos and have the chance to travel to Korea, noted this place for your trip, it won’t let you down.5. Easily to reach whenever you have free time	You should present your ID to enter.- Opening hours (closing days: Every Monday)	Summer time (Mar. – Oct.): 9A.M – 4P.M	Winter time (Nov. – Feb.): 10A.M – 3P.M- Closing hours:	Summer time: 6P.M	Winter time: 5P.M	This “5 reasons” is just my quick review for a competition, but from the bottom of my heart, I really recommend this place for all of you who have read this review. 	If you travel to Korea, don’t miss this place, or you will have to go again haha.#theseoulcitywall #hanyangdoseong #hanyangdoseong2019 #theseoulcitywalltour2019#한양도성 #한양도성투어 #한양도성투어2019 #펀데이코리아네트웍스 #펀데이코리아#FKN #fundaykoreanetworks #fundaykorea #eventsinkorea #freeeventsinkorea #ilovekorea #iloveseoul"
9,5.0,"Visiting Namsan Tower, Nammi Island or Myeong Dong are definitely experiences you have to try once in your life when you come to Seoul. However, this article will suggest you a place with a completely different style from the above locations. It is Hanyang Doseong (Seoul City Wall) and 05 reasons why you should visit it.1. Historical significanceIn English, Hanyang Doseong (한양도성) means “The city wall of old Seoul”. It was built in 1396 under King Taejo. The wall is 18.627 kilometers long and run along the ridge of Seoul’s four inner mountains: Baegaksan (Bugaksan), Naksan, Mongmyeoksan (Namsan) and Inwangsan. At the beginning, the wall was used to protect Seoul and divided between in and out of this city. Therefore, it is not only visit a simple place, you will enjoy the historical atmosphere enveloping here.2. Unique architectureHanyang Doseong carries the architecture of many periods of Korean culture and nation’s building skills. Depending on the period of construction, stone in the walls is different. This is indeed very interesting if you pay close attention. Besides, Seoul City wall has four main gates and four ancillary gates with special meaningful names which reminds people about the right way to live. For example, Sungnyemun gate means polite; Donuimun gate means righteous; Sukjeongmun means wise and Heunginjimun means generous. 3. Associated with other famous places It would be wrong if you think that there is no interested thing in Hanyang Doseong. Surrounding the whole city of Seoul, Hanyang Doseong associated with many famous tourist attractions such as Nam San Tower, Blue House or Dongdaemun area. This time I just had a short trip from Dongdaemun to Hyeamun but I saw many different places, including: the Church, the Temple, the Museum, the ancient village (Ihwa) and so on. Each place has its own unique features including both ancient and modern. There are many Korean dramas are filmed here like of Encounter of Song Hye Kyo and Park Bo Gum. 4. A way of doing exercise and meet lovely Seoul peopleBy searching in google: “A tour guide map of Hanyang Doseong”, you can easily find a map or an app to travel here. I believe that it would be very useful because it is not only give you the instruction but also give you about the distance, time and the amount of calories you have to consume for each specific stage. I have seen many adults and children come here to run, do exercise or just to breathe some fresh air. Besides that, if you are lucky, you also can meet some retired tour guides here. They are old but speak English every well and they are super funny. Listening to their stories about Seoul made me so surprised.  5. See the whole of Seoul The wall located in a high place so it is a perfect place to see the whole of Seoul. Looking down from here, you can see a Seoul both dynamic and friendly with environment and human. I am sure that no matter what time you are in Seoul city wall, in the dawn or sunset, you still can take many different beautiful photos without filters. Visiting Hanyang City Wall, I learned why people love and like Korea so much. The wall in particular and Seoul in general are not boring but full of history, profound humanity."
10,5.0,"Seoul City Wall is one of signature places where you have to visit when in Korea. For me, this place is so interesting with the harmonization between history and natural beauty, not just a Wall =)). So I'm here today to tell you why I am so fond of this Wall :>1.	Acquiring more knowledge about Korea including Korean history, architecture and people.About Korean history, Hanyang doseong enables me to know more about the ancient capital of Korea. It used to be smaller than now and covered by 4 main mountains. The center of this capital was for royalty and citizens living and doing business. Seoul city wall known as Hanyang doseong links four mountain including Baegaksan, Naksan, Namsan, and Inwangsan together. There were four main gates representing the basic tenets of Confucianism, namely, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, and between them were four ancillary gates. I was really surprised that there was a ancillary gate which used to be used as a gate only for bringing dead people out to bury.About architecture, there are 4 types of arranging stones inscribing with information about the wall’s construction. The methods and types of stones also make me know that there always had the development in Korean architecture in the eras of different kings.2.	Ameliorating both your mental and physical health.Seoul City Wall has a total length of 18.627 kilometers which can become a suitable place for everyone to do exercise. As I prefer walking so much, Seoul City Wall is a great place for me to go for a walk every afternoon and train my health at weekend but unluckily, I am living too far from this place. On the other hand, this place can also be a comfortable place when you are tired or stressed. As this place is far from main road covered by many trees, the atmosphere here is quite fresh and quiet. As a result, you can escape from the hustle and bustle of busy life after a hardworking day or when you just need a place to relax.3.	Enjoying Seoul from an interesting sideThis place is at least 124m (at Naksan Mt.) higher than the ground so I can see the Seoul with an overview. Although I had just experienced Seoul City Wall at the point of Naksan Mt., I felt really incredible here. I can see both old and modern houses surrounding with trees, and you know it is kind of spring now so everything is super great. I have a thought that I will come back here some days in the evening to see how bling bling Seoul can be at night.4.	Having an opportunity to visit other signature places of Seoul.On the way with my commentator in Naksan Mt., my group accidentally went to a village called Ihwa. Ihwa village was so cute in my eyes with many beautiful painting in the house wall and some old-fashioned houses which I only saw in my favorite Korean drama called Reply 1988. Good news here is that you can hire a student uniform and take photos in every corners which makes you feel like a main actress in Reply 1988 :>5.	Taking photosSeoul City Wall has everything for you to take photos, everywhere can become your background . So let’s enjoy it. :)"

12,4.0,It's great to view of the city and nature. The locations so near from JW Mariot Hotels. You must visit this place.
13,4.0,"Bring your sneakers because you want to take a long wall to the top. Along the wall you see some of houses still constructed back in the area of times. When you get the top you can see the amazing view of the city. It is worth seeing. This place is free. If you don't want to walk all the way, take a left turn into the path, walk downhill and see the local community. Some of old folks are in amazing shape. They walk up and down the steep hill to get to where they are going. There is a Seoul City Museum that is near by.  Go see it first."
