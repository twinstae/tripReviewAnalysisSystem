I came during the early afternoon, and stayed at one of the cafes to wait for the sunset and I’m glad I did, as the sky was beautiful that night and with all the lit up decorations and the buildings, it looked especially magical. Loved the giant owl - my first time seeing it here. You can come here at any time of the year, as it is peaceful and quiet to walk by the river. There are some game arcades in one of the floating islands which I had fun playing in the summer. Banpo Bridge is next to it, so definitely stay around for the lights show at Banpo Bridge."

It’s a nice area to take a stroll, with lots of shops and seating area along the water to enjoy a coffee or snack (me and food). One can even rent a floating picnic boat for up to 6 people and enjoy an afternoon on the water, or head in front of the islands and sit in the park, watching people picnic and flying kites"

We passed by many capturing beauties along the way, and there I saw the the 3 luminous buildings in Floating Island, that time I knew we should visit the place. Floating Island is a romantic place at night. There are restaurants, cafes/tea shop and clean toilets. Walking around in this man made island at night is a great experience."
