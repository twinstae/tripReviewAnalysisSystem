0,5.0,"I went twice during the trip, one night trip for buffet dinner and food is not bad and view is awesome. One day trip close to sunset. Both day and night trip is awesome and I love the view and Seoul is under your leg. Do not miss this scenery."
1,5.0,Do go there if you get the chance! The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful park.Cars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way up.There is a steep climb at the end but well worth it! You are taken into a room with  a picture of cars travelling along on the floor which was quite spectacular.The ride in the lift up to the top was spectacular with a visual experience.Outstanding views at the top with great photo opportunities. Loved it.
2,5.0,Awesome location and must visit activity. Go there prior sunset and stay there until sunsets to view sunset
3,3.0,"Too many lines. No sign posts. View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective. The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better. If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average."
4,2.0,We spend lots of time waiting in line to go up and even more to go down. The view from the bottom of the tower were maybe even better than from the top. Really overrated site.
5,5.0,"We came here as part of our bus tour, so it was a quick 1 hour tour and we had to get going. Place has several coffee shops and restaurants if you have more time. The view was spectacular from above. Well worth the time. Easily spend more time if you can spare."
6,4.0,"Magical place!I arrived at 8PM and lift at 11PM. So in daylight and night and the twilight....The restaurant turns so you see all of Seoul from a bird point of view.It is expensive like 100 euro. But so worth it.And very good as well. Small portions, so if you have a big appetite......üò¨üò¨üò¨It is very quite and lots of privacy."
7,5.0,"We took the cable car up to the mountain, the views were stunning, there was much to see and the waiting time wasn't as bad as i expected took only about 5 mins on a Tue at 3PM, highly would recommend, the voucher redemption was easy as well the machines present had an English option."
8,4.0,"An early dinner on 38th floor of Hotel Lotte and we were off to the N Seoul tower .We could see the tower from the hotel .After a mini bus ride to a little hill , we had a cable car ride to the hill top to reach the base of the tower.A swift lift took us to the observation floor, which is circular all round the tower giving magnificent view of the city .The are nic e write ups to describe the sights and also major cities in each direction with distances - very nice info."
9,5.0,"The tower offers great panorama of Seoul. I didn't  go to the tower during my previous visits. This time my hotel was in a walking distance, therefore I decided to visit the tower. I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many facilities that offer food and drinks, including draft beer. Based on my experience, I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner, see the panorama in daylight and after dark, and enjoy glass of beer. I usually walk a lot, however walking to the tower was too much exercise and I had sore muscles even three days after. So some people should consider cable car."
10,4.0,Definitely worth a visit if just for the Seoul views. You go up by cable car. There is a whole collection of ' lovers locks' tied to each other and to whatever it can be locked on. Largest collection I have ever seen.  The views from the top are mindblowing and give a fair idea of the size and plan of Seoul.
11,4.0,Visited with a good colleague and he talked me into visiting on a day with good views. It was fantastic; what an experience. On the square at the foot of the tower there are lots of activities.
12,3.0,"Seoul tower offers the most amazing & complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place. However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much.Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there.You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view.There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus.The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view."
13,5.0,"You must see this tower and the park nearby, you must see the city from very top there and fall in love with it"
14,4.0,"Walking up the hill to the tower on a Sunday morning was a great way to see the people of the city out for there health and enjoyment.  The views from the overlooks on the way up the hill were beautiful, and the foliage was in full color."
15,5.0,"I visited this place and learned that also Korean people love to come to this place. I had a beautiful but exhausting walk up the hill but on the way lovely view already. I need to mention that there is a cable car available for those who don't want to exercise.On top of the tower I had a beautiful view over the huge city of Seoul. Around the base of the tower there are shops, cafes and restaurants to take a rest.Highly recommended."
16,5.0,A cable car ride in the night time is worth taking and then reaching the tower is a pleasant feeling.
17,5.0,"Great stunning views of Seoul. However, lines are super long. It took us 30min to get tickets for the cable car. Additional 20min to get tickets for elevator to go up. Here is the killer, 1 hour line to come back down!! I am sure it also depends on time of the day and weather etc. regardless, it was all worth it. We loved the view. There is also coffee shops up there to enjoy your latte."
18,5.0,"Touristy, yes, but a must see when in Seoul. Great to walk down from the top, and don't miss the love locks! üòÄ"
19,2.0,"Visited on a Sunday night. Queued almost 50 minutes to go on the cable car which held about 40 people so not as ""romantic"" as it sells. Then queued up to go to the observatory tower. View is worth it but there are better views elsewhere where the view is still as good. Worth the time? Hindsight, probably not, go on a weekday."
20,5.0,"hi, i just want to share how beautiful sunset view and how to get there..if you want to go up to the top of Nseoul tower, the entrance fee KRW10.000 and also have package with drink + popcorn KRW21.000i go to Namsan Seoul Tower (N Seoul Tower) by bus number 03, but you can also use number 02 or 05 (detail bus stop attached)arrived at the bus stop of Namsan Seoul Tower, i had to walk through uphills road about 300meter.. little bit exhausted :(there have a elevator also.. i just known it when i want to back to the bus stationwonderful view of seoul city and sunset made my weary gone..enjoy it and take some picture of lovelock.. end of sept weather with 16 degrees celcius up there"
21,4.0,"A classic choice for a tour of Seoul. It's a bit of a journey going up there, but a nice experence once you've made it. Consider using the cable car."
22,4.0,"It's quite a climb from the where the bus drops us off and up to ground level of the tower - so make sure you're ready for a hike, wear comfortable shoes.  The view from the grounds below and at the top of the tower is magnificent during the day or night if you get clear skies, I was lucky enough to be there when sky was clear.  We had a buffet dinner at the top of the tower, I would say the view was more magnificent than the food."
23,3.0,We were expecting nice view on Seoul TV Tower at night but We were unlucky. It was foggy/cloudy night. Korean food is served but I found that most of them are average quality and taste. I had Korean food experience...
24,5.0,it is good to see seoul from above. worth visit. it takes 1 hour tour. u have to walk up the hill. i like it
25,2.0,Unless you are a world tower traveler not sure there is anything here for you. It goes up and offers a nice view of the city. That is true and overpriced THe revolving restaurant is WAY overpriced. I only ate there b/c we won a free meal and the 2 glasses of nasty wine was still $20.00. The walk was good exercise up the little trail though.
26,3.0,"The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better, however you do not need to actually go up the tower. The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn‚Äôt get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower."
27,1.0,"Since in april and may weather is smokey and rainy! You wont be able to see any view,plus the pollution clouds coming from mainland chins"
28,4.0,"You can see one of the best view of Seoul in this tower. Usually a bunch of people (tourists) are hanging around. Seoul is about 500 years old city. The first king of Chosun dynasty set up Seoul as the centre of Korea. Since then, it has been the hub of politics, economy and power. And now it is the capital of Republic of Korea.ÏÑúÏö∏ÏùÑ Í¥ÄÎûåÌïòÎäîÎç∞ Í∞ÄÏû• Ï¢ãÏùÄ Ïû•ÏÜå!!! ÏÇ¨ÏßÑ Ï∞çÍ∏∞ÏóêÎèÑ Ï¢ãÍ≥† ÏÇ∞Ï±ÖÌïòÍ∏∞ÏóêÎèÑ Ï¢ãÏúºÎ©∞ Í∞ÄÏ°±Ïó¨ÌñâÏóêÎèÑ Íµø!!!

29,5.0,Second tallest tower in Seoul and it's a love lock location. The tower have 5 f. And each of the floor have it's own attraction.
30,4.0,"You can reach the tower via foot or by cable car. At the main times, you will wait for the cable car longer than you need to walk up to the tower. The tower offers a wonderful view over Seoul. So if you go to the tower, spend some more money to go up inside of the tower. It's worth it."
31,5.0,"We spent an hour at the Tower, because the view was very nice. You can buy fridge magnets, odds and ends. Recommended."
32,5.0,a great place to be ... very nice view from the tower top but very nice escalade from the city to the hill top
33,4.0,Try the hike to Seoul tower. Short and sweet but memorable once you reach the tower . Excellent hike especially on a cold day
34,5.0,"If one desire the best view of Seoul, this is the place you want to be. The view is fantastic. The walk up is a good exercise but totally worthy."
35,5.0,Really great views across the city Good to go at dusk and stay after dark to see both day and night views.
36,5.0,"Spectacular views over Seoul. Good refreshment facilities at the tower. Quite a difficult walk, probably 70% is climbing steps, but well worth the effort required."
37,5.0,"You will get the best view of Seoul. Ice cream, food & others are available. Large Led panel offers a great view. Enjoy cultural programs also."
38,5.0,This spot is just great.  You can get a great view of the city and the tower it self has some really interesting things to see and do.
39,5.0,Enjoyable and easy climb up Namsan Mountain to Seoul Tower with a wonderful panoramic view of Seoul.
40,5.0,"Went with my Brother and his wife and even though it was foggy that day, the view was still really nice. We walked up to the tower but there are also buses you can take."
41,4.0,Nice to see from tower Seoul city. This is my first time in Seoul so i really enjoyed to see Seoul city from Tower .I recommend to visit this place.
42,4.0,"This impressive Tower literally does tower above the Seoul skyline.  The easiest way to reach it is by taxi or take a tour, but the effort is well worth it.  It is situated on the top of a hill with a fast winding road to arrive.  The views are magnificent;  across towards North Korea to the North, and across the whole city spread out to the South.  Very impressive."
43,5.0,"Seoul Tower at night was spectacular, the entire city is lit up and you can see for miles. The cable car up to the tower was also a fun way to get up there. There are shops for souvenirs and food as well plus many different spots to view the city."
44,5.0,"If you go up there you will enjoy an 360¬∞ unbelievable view of Seoul and surroundings. It is surely worth the trip to see how big this city really is with over 20 million inhabitants close to seaside on one side, close to high mountains ( with skiing possibilities ) on the other side."
45,4.0,Superrrrr place for sightseeing especially in the evening.We visited in the evening and the lighting is superb.Not to be missed since you can see the entire skyline of Seoul
46,5.0,Stopped here while taking a bus tour of the city. Amazing views of the city on a clear day. Even better at night.
47,4.0,I went there as a tour leader and brought all my guests there! it was pretty cool when u come to Korea around april because the path to go to the N seoul tower got so many trees and some flowers are blooming. look like a cherry blossom! but seriously it wont be cool if u come in summer coz it will make u double sweating :P
48,5.0,"It was a great experience going up the N Tower this time in a car instead of the cable car. It was certainly a different view. As I recall 10 years ago the inside of the tower is slightly different to what it is today. For example 10 years back there was no LED tunnel at the entrance. The entrance is unique the tunnel is made of LED panel that plays 3 different videos. It started with Seoul City, universe or nebula and followed by marine lives. All different video gives one different feeling as you walk through it. My favorite so far is the marine life video."
49,3.0,"Not much to do in Seoul, so you can visit a big tower that is bathed in colorful light at night. Nice view from the cable car and from the hill the tower is on."
50,5.0,123 floorsExiting Fast liftsSky restaurant Good food and and a reasonable menu for a sky restaurant Well organized and good security Enjoyed üòÅPhoto facility excellent
51,5.0,It's a wonderful place with amazing city view. I recommended it strongly to all tourists who visit Seoul. Very nice elevator look like Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The place contain many terraces with nice view. We reached the tower with bus.
52,5.0,"I was fortunate enough to be staying across the street from the hillside entrance to N Seoul Tower so I took advantage of my proximity and hiked the hillside one morning.  The climb isn't easy to dress appropriately but once you've reached the tower the view makes it all worth while.  I've been told that the view is hit or miss based on the level of ""yellow dust"" in the city but I was fortunate enough to have a perfect view of the bustling, enormous city below.  Take an additional trip at night for a spectacular view."
53,5.0,One of the Icon of Seoul City. N Seoul Tower is very nice place to spend your afternoon especially in Autumn. I would recommend this place for couple because is very romantic.
54,4.0,"Seoul Tower in South Korea (Namsan Tower)Seoul Tower, also called Namsan Tower or, more recently, N Seoul Tower, is located in the centre of Seoul on Mount Namsan. Seoul Tower was opened to the public for the first time on the 15th of October 1980. Namsan Tower is 236.7 metres high and, because it stands on Namsan Seoul Towertop of Mount Namsan, it rises to about 480 metres above sea level, thus allowing visitors to enjoy a great panoramic view of Seoul.Seoul Tower was remodelled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005, with the name of N Seoul Tower (N stands for new). The new tower has a new lighting system that makes the tower spectacular at night; new facilities such as restaurants, shops, caf√©s; a lobby with a media zone where films and music videos are shown for free; two pavilions, one for exhibitions and the other for performances; two observatories, the new digital observatory with new state of the art digital telescopes and the classic analogue observatory; a new revolving western style restaurant called N Grill on the top floor."
55,5.0,One of the must-do-things when visiting Seoul. The view from the top of the tower was beautiful. Tickets can be purchased from various websites online which are generally cheaper than buying on the spot.
56,4.0,"To get to this place you either take a cable car or climb all the way up 1.5 kilometers. This is a tower that can overlook the whole of Seoul. But to access the top you would need an entry fee of about 10,000 won."
57,5.0,There is a nice view also with a cable car.Better if it was sunny. Nice park under the tower so you can walk down
58,4.0,Namsan tower is one of the main spot to visit in Seoul. We enjoyed  walking up to the tower and the scenery around is very nice. We enjoyed nice city view from the tower.
59,5.0,"It's a very big tourist spot. We visited this place on a Wednesday night. It was difficult to find from the Metro. But we had a nice walk through the small winding steep roads. There is an easy access elevator to use, but we were on the wrong path. The views from the tower were great, since it was clear day. The shops were a little pricey."
60,5.0,Got the opportunity to go up tower just before dusk and able to see city fully in daylight and then after dark.  This should be on everyone's first visit ...time to remember.
61,4.0,This is well worth a trip but there is quite a steep walk from the parking area. The elevator that goes to the main viewing level is super fast and accompanied by a sound and light show on it ceiling.The 360 degree views from the tower show just how  big Seoul is. There was entertainment on a lower level on the day I was there.
62,5.0,"Tower on South mountain offers great view to the city. Definitely must to see in Seoul, do not miss it!"
63,4.0,"This tower is on top of a mountain in Seoul, It is accessed by an elevator, and the line for the elevator gets longer as afternoon approaches.The view is spectacular from the top, It is best to go in the morning - and on a day that the air quality is good."
64,4.0,N Seoul Tower being the second highest point in South Korea is a good place to enjoy the panoramic view of the city especially at night where you can see the beautiful color of the city lights.
65,3.0,Make sure having fine weather before proceeding.Located on top of the hill and can see the whole of Seoul.Best is with Hot coffee in your hand while walking 360 degree absorbing the view of Seoul.
66,5.0,"Hiked this area a few times during my visit. Great exercise, great views and a very cool area. Totally enjoyed the whole area around the Tower."
67,5.0,"this is an excellent place to visit, the food in the restuarant is very good and has a large range it suit all palates. The view is stunning and it is a must doo when visiting Seoul"
68,3.0,"Similar to other towers in Korea.  I think they must all be run by the same company.  Nice views, but overall, not much else.  You walk around, look out, and then go back down."
69,4.0,"If you are in Seoul, try to visit the Seoul Tower for a breathtaking view of this vibrant city. Located  at the outskirts, this place is little  difficult to get in,  but provides a grand view overlooking this bustling  city"
70,4.0,Nothing fancy but the locks that were displayed to show love was an amazing sight to see. The tower showed the view of Korea and i am not a big fan it. Same like burj khalifa.
71,5.0,I wish i could have seen the place during an evening tour because the view from up there is spectacular. Unfortunately my visit was not for leisure and was for work. There are love locks everywhere so be sure to purchase a lock set and place a mark there. There is also a beautiful scenic bus/car ride down.Definitely a must do while in Seoul !
72,5.0,Go there in the night at God weather and you will have a beautiful view of Seoul. A must visit of you are around
73,4.0,"Everyone at one point must see the N Seoul Tower. It's one of those places that you just need to see. It's great for views. Go on a clear day. It's a lot of walking, so be prepared. It's also a steep climb, either with or without steps. Depends upon which side you walk. This is definitely one of those places that you need to see."
74,4.0,"Upon entering the tower, you walk into an elevator that ""shoot"" you up the tower to the level where there is a beautifully laid out restaurant with a 360¬∞ view around it, overlooking the beautiful city of Seoul. The elevator has a screen on the ceiling that plays a video that entices you in feeling like you have been launched in a rocket up and out of the tower - spectacular!!The restaurant serves a wonderful variety of both Korean and Western cuisine, and as rivalled only by the spectacular views - especially in the evening, where the city lights form a bright kaleidoscope of colour!It is a wonderful experience, and a must in your to do's whilst experiencing a spectacular city."
75,5.0,This is the best place to get an amazing view of the city! It is well worth the walk and the cable car ride. We were here twice as we decided to view it again in the dark and it was incredible! I would recommend the night option!
76,4.0,"This again is one of those must see places in Seoul.. you must take an adventurous steep walk to get up but once your up the view is amazing. Might be difficult for those having difficulty walking distances. One of the things I loved most was buying the locks with two keys and attaching it to the millions of others while keeping the key.. Nice snacks, ice cream and churos await you at the top and plenty of photo opps"
77,5.0,"...on a clear day.  Bit of a bummer to get up there and have the view obstructed by fog or haze.  On a clear day though, fantastic view of the city and all therein, and the hills (mountains?) surrounding the city."
78,4.0,Best feature of the tower is the markings on the glass describing where things are located in the North. Cool thing to see.
79,5.0,Nice display at night on the tower walls. Some nice food establishments and shops there..pleasant place for a date or excitable kids. :)
80,5.0,"I love cornball tourist attractions, and giant towers usually fit the bill perfectly. This is no exception with a lot of legit scenic beauty and views from the tower to go along with like 5 floors of weird attractions from arcades to a Hello Kitty museum. I happened to be there at the moment some historical recreation lunacy was going on and it was super cool. Protip: Cable car up, walk down for a fun trip."
81,4.0,There is nothing special with the tower. You should take a walk from Nam Shan park to the tower and visit the live bridge with tones of locks.
82,4.0,"We started our walk from The Hyatt hotel, and it was just all up! Fantastic and lovely walk thru this park. Loved how there were 2 gym areas to do you workouts, lovely clean areas everywhere - this is how ALL of Korea is CLEAN AND TIDY. Whilst walking we past a lovely small lake which has heaps of 'gold' fish in it - however the lake was frozen - rather funny as we tried to drop stones on it to confirm it was frozen"" ‚ùÑÔ∏èas it was -6"" and we were loving it. There was also a lovely kids playground and some interesting signs around the park. Then came the huge steep hills, they have steps or ramps to get up them, which I had to do the ramp. (Definitely need shoes with a good grip). Once we finally got to the top we found out that there was a bus that could take you to the top. I'd recommend this if you couldn't do the walk as it's definitely something that you should see. From the top we found this incredible view 360"" of Seoul. We had a lovely cheap lunch - pizza & drink - I was there with my brother & the restaurant took us to an area which was for couples - love seat with an amazing view. Would've been great if I was with my husband, so we got up & went to another area which was heaps cheaper & perfect for what we needed. When heading into the tower be ready to gave your photo taken & to make a pose. Unfortunately we didn't do it in time so we got a crappie photo. There are shops underneath the tower however most of them went finished being built, only a couple open, so not really worth going into until they're finished. Enjoy the return walk as it's mostly down hill, we actually went thru a dirt track coming back and it went straight down the side of the mountain - extremely quickly considering it took as about 45 minutes to get to the top and about 20mins to go back down. If taking the short cut be very careful but definitely worth it."
83,4.0,There is no better view in Seoul than from here.  We went at night--which was spectacular. Take the tram to the tower--it is fun ride.  We actually did dinner in the tower. The restaurant revolves so you see all of Seoul over one hour.  There are lots of stores etc here also.
84,4.0,It was good views of the Seoul city. I specially liked the ritual of putting a lock here for your love.
85,5.0,"A 20 minute ride by taxi from Gangnam district to the cable car station where you get a ticket to go to the base of the tower.Keep in mind that there aren't a lot of cable cars and the queue can be a long one.You can pay for the tickets by credit cards.An enchanting wall with love locks at the base of the tower is a must in Seoul where you can buy the lock from the top.Scenic images from the top with the city skyline are priceless.On your way down, you can walk and grab a coffee at the many coffee shops on the road to the bottom."
86,4.0,"This is actually anothe one telco tower used in the past, renovated to serve as a tourist attraction. The view is great if the sky is clear or you can go nite time to enjoy the city lights. Other than that nothing really special. Surrounding area is v beatiful and has some interesting trails to walk."
87,5.0,I travel a lot for conferences and meetings world wide. That most includes a lot of sitting and inactivity. So it was a real pleasure to work the many steps to the Seoul Tower. And the view of this gigantic city - twice the size as my country - was amazing.
88,4.0,"The views from the tower would be great if the weather is good, unfortunately for me it was very cloudy and foggy, so couldnt see much. Anyways the ride up on the cable car was interesting."
89,5.0,I have walked around this park several times.  You can make it up to the top in less then an hour depending on how fast you want to make the trip.  Great trails both on asphalt and through the woods.  So nice variety.  Amazing 360 degree views around the city.  Can take the tram down as well.
90,5.0,"Amazing view and unforgettable visit especially in winter , a must see in Seoul where you can enjoy the Cable car ride to reach there"
91,4.0,"If you have time , it's nice to visit . The view was amazing but it's quite nice to have coffee when you see view"
92,5.0,"great experience you shouldnt skip. dont forget to buy your lock (is a Korean young people custom). although the line takes at least 30 minutes, it's worth the wait"
93,4.0,"On the top of a mountain, the tallest tower in Seoul gives u a spectacular 360 degree view of the city. You reach the tower via cable car, which costs 10000 won per person and around the same amount for entry into the tower itself. Food isn't great and the souvenirs are a bit tacky. But the experience itself is really nice."
94,4.0,From Seoul Tower you have the best view ever for Seoul . Easy access with several buses taking you there . All facilities as good coffee and a meal while being there. And of course you take the elevator all the way to the top .
95,4.0,"very good maintenance system, there is two times entrance fee, for the cable car to the top that bring you to the high peak area and another entrance to the namsan tower."
96,5.0,Walking up the mountain and viewing the city from the tower waa a great experience. *aim to get there by 5PM. That way you can witness the view both in daylight abd2 then in night
97,4.0,The views from the restaurant near the top of the N Seoul tower were breathtaking. Be prepared to walked up a very steep hill to enjoy the views.
98,5.0,"Towers can often be kitchy, and there is kitch here. But it's set in a wonderful park with lots of people out for exercise, and the views are amazing. Seoul is a big city and one really gets a good idea of how big the city is, how everything is connected, where the river goes and the many little mountains in town."
99,3.0,"It seemed like the thing to do, so we booked a tour that included the N Seoul Tower. It was nice, but basically like any other space needle. Our guide had us up to the top pretty quickly, but if you have to wait in those 1-2 hour lines, find something else to do."
100,5.0,"if you wanna see the view of the city ,esp at nighttime with glittering skyscrapers and lights from the highways and running cars, it worths going to this attraction at night. the lookout provides  different angle of city ,hill, skyscrapers and Han river. If you are bored with tower or something highest in the city,Just forget it . looking around Namsan park at ground level is also recommmended."
101,5.0,"You can see breathtaking city views from Seoul Tower. We purchased tickets for the tower, but realized we saw everything from the top of the hill that we saw from the tower. We bought a love lock to leave behind, there were many options of food to choose from, and the cable car made the trip up and back very quick and convenient."
102,4.0,"This is an excellent experience, but the lines are long lines were too much for me to cope. Seems to be that an excellent experience attracts too many people, so I cannot blame them."
103,4.0,It's not easy to get there if you have problems walking but the view is a reward you you do. Awesome view :)
104,5.0,Really worth it to go up and enjoy the nature of rocky mountain by cable car to reach to the tower to enjoy the city seeing
105,3.0,"Like most ""tallest towers"" in the world this was a very busy place, even on weeknight. There is an impressive collection of love locks and a post office at the top of the tower, that sells postcards, with stamps, so you can write home to mum!"
106,3.0,"I wne tot he Tower on a Sunday, and it was very busy - Did not go in and to the Top, the view from the top of the cable car was really beautiful and I did not feel the need to go all the way!"
107,5.0,"Amazing, even the way to the tower is very nice full greenish & going gradually to high, you can spend the whole day there.ŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ÿ¨ÿØÿß ÿ¨ÿØÿß ŸÖŸÑŸä ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∂ÿ±ÿ© Ÿàÿ≠ÿ™Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇ ŸÑŸÑÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨ ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ¨ ŸàÿßÿÆÿ∂ÿ± ŸàŸäŸÖŸÉŸÜŸÉ ŸÇÿ∂ÿßÿ° ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ ŸäŸàŸÖŸÉ ŸáŸÜÿßŸÉGo up with very advance left, just they will ask you to look top of the left for the panorama & you will find yourself on the top."
108,5.0,"The N Seoul Tower, especially at night, looks amazing. It's not expensive to go up in it so you can enjoy hands down to best view of the whole city, which is huge."
109,4.0,A good place to visit if you are in Seoul which offers some great views of the city. Lot of eating options available here. You can buy some souvenirs from here.
110,5.0,I had been here many years back but I went there again in this trip   ITS always refreshing to go there and see Seoul from a top.
111,5.0,Nice views. However the views from the cable car might be enough and you might not need to  go up. The cost is not too expensive as well
112,4.0,This is accessed via a cable car. The wait for the car is quite long. When we arrived all at the ticket office had gone for their break! Having said that when they returned the queue went down more quickly. The charge for the cable car doesn't include the trip up the tower this is an additional cost. There are places to eat at the base of the tower. The queue to return in the cable car was huge so we decided to walk down the mountain. This took about 20 minutes. There are some great viewing platforms on the way down.
113,4.0,"The N Seoul Tower is a bit of a trek north of the city, with optional cable car to carry you up the hill to the peak. Views are spectacular with a great vista in all directions you get so see the sea of buildings across the green hills of Seoul metropolitan area, surrounded by mountains in the distance. A great place to watch the sunset.Dining options include a restaurant (book in advance) and a Korean food buffet (remarkably good value and high quality food)."
114,3.0,"If you can go on a clear day, then make the trip, otherwise, don't worry.On the top you can do a full circle to see the surroundings and the view is lovely but too often there's bad visibility.There's the usual opportunities to buy souvenirs, candy, coffee on several floors!"
115,5.0,worthwhile going up the tower during sunset and or evening as there is  stunning view of Seoul from the tower. There are several restaurants if you wish to have a meal there.
116,5.0,I visit Seoul tower and one of interesting thing same as India i saw in India peoples tied a trade on tree and wish i in Seoul Tower young boys and girls lock a locker and wish and keep the keys
117,4.0,"Visted there with business partners, nice view there, can see nice sunset and they have area for lovers to place those love charm locks, some even use phone case for writing more messages.  Can also dinner there, is new so not very crowd.  Good Food but rmb no smoking there, if really need a smoke pls do it before the cable car."
118,3.0,"I thought I'd walk up vs take the cable car ... It's quite a hike up the many many stairs, so get ready for some exercise ... But there are these mango popsicles you can get at the top so that helps !"
119,5.0,"The view of the city is superf from this point. You must go there at the evening, taking advantage of the sunset and the night view. The price is not expansive taking into account the view. You can use a cable car to get the N Tower, which is the best way to go there. The price is about 12‚Ç¨ (Cable car + N Tower). There is a Queue that you must win before reach the tower, which lasts about 60 minutes."
120,4.0,Well worth the effort - panoramic views over Seoul. Reasonably priced mementos. Night or day view - both quite spectacular.
121,5.0,The Seoul Tower is a nice attraction of Seoul. The ticket costs around 10 dollars and the view of the entire cityis amazing!
122,4.0,"I was here during the weekend and there were folk dances and sings, very impressive for foreigners. I saw samurai dances, I've listened the famous ""Arirang"" song."
123,5.0,"It lays in Namsan Hill with spectacular view of Seoul city. Wish to see visit it again at night.There's a place for love locks where couple can buy locks and write their names on it and lock it on fences or provided public fixture, to wish love endurance and happiness as so they believe.There's a cafe and souvenir shop, so if you tired of walking up you can take a rest for a while. Probably because I was so excited, I did not feel exhausted. Just want to maximize my time before the travel ended since it's only short visit.Next time will bring my family to pay a visit again."
124,5.0,Generally too touristy but if you're lucky you can get in when it's quiet and enjoy some performances. Even at the bottom you have some great views of Seoul so don't feel like you need to go all the way to the observatory deck to have a view! I usually walk down to Myeongdong area from the Cable Car entrance via the horizontal elevator. Can do the same going up if you want to save on taxi fare.
125,5.0,"It is very beautiful place. The view of the city is quite breathtaking. They have 360 degrees glass walls offering a good view, however the inside is very brightly lit, so good luck taking any bird eye photos in the night! However, I presume it would be good before/during sunset. The love-locks area is also quite good. Overall recommended place."
126,3.0,It looks good till the time you reach the top. The excitement in the cable car and the temple before the entry is quite dramatic and raises your expectation. But once you are on the top and with the stunning view of the city - is totally spoilt with the bright neon light and absolutely not possible to take any picture. Its a total waste if you plan to visit the place to take some good picture. This is in the evening - I am not sure what happens in the day time though.
127,3.0,Its a very steep walk up the hill to the tower but if you can afford the 90 minute wait you can take the aerial cable car.  Give the tower a miss and explore the delights of the extensive parklands as you stroll back down to the city.
128,4.0,We visited this place in the night. It is open till 10.30 PM. We didn't get a chance to go up to the observatory as it was extremely crowded. But all other spots at N Seoul Tower are beautiful and the view of the city from the top is beautiful.There are a couple of restaurants on top. You can trek one way and take the cable car the other way.
129,5.0,"This tower is a must see when you star in elevator, a light show welcomes you and show projections outside and inside elevator.View is amazing with many interesting information available."
130,5.0,Awesome view of city in the evening.  We climbed and spend good time. It is very cool and has excellent preservation of nature in the city. Amazed to see how good they have maintained.
131,4.0,"there is a mild mountain in the city center of Seoul with beautiful park around it. You can go up by walk or use Tele cabin to reach the tower. In the tower by elevator go to upper floor and enjoy from 360 degree view of Seoul. there are some shops to by Korean Souvenir here, telescope to watch city, memorials photo ... .In the ground floor you can find Love lock trees by different colors from beautiful locks.also there are some coffee shops and restaurants over there"
132,4.0,That is a must if you are in this area. We walked up arround the tower this is a long way but nice to do. We had Lunch there and we found a great buffet. Verry good foot
133,3.0,All big cities seem to have a tall tower of some description and this one is Seoul's. Not sure what function it serves or why it is even there. One thing is for sure though that you can't miss it if in Seoul. You will find it lurking in the background of many of your photos in Seoul.
134,1.0,caught a taxi to get up there to have a little look. unfortunately the taxi didn't get me there and left me at the cable car entrance. there i waited more than an our to go up. than another hour to get in the lift of the tower. visited 10 minutes and then it took me another hour to get back down. queues everywhere.  i regret i went there...
135,5.0,The hike to the base of the tower provides the opportunity to digest breath taking views of the expanse of the Seoul city scapes-it is so compelling. Seoul Tower illuminates my inner soul just looking at this spectacular landmark. It is a must see.
136,5.0,Nice view of the city in the day as well as in the night. You should  go to Seoul Tower if you are in Seoul.
137,4.0,One of the star attractions of Seoul is the Seoul tower. You can locate it from distance as well as its quite high and also located on the hill. Nice place to visit.
138,4.0,"If you visit seoul,you must visit N Seoul Tower..this tower is a symbol of korea..dont forget to bring your  padlock and write your name and your couple also..."
139,3.0,"The observation deck is small, and there is not much story-telling or explanation of the places you can see from the tower. The gifts sold on site are exquisite, and that's the best part of the place."
140,4.0,"U dont have to go up.if u r budget traveler ,just to reach up the mountain is great and free.Before sun set was WOW"
141,5.0,A must see!  Make sure you visit in the late afternoon and stay into the night.  The views are incredible and you won't soon forget your visit.
142,3.0,"You can get the teleferic to get to the top (less than 5 minutes) or get there walking (many stairs, be aware). Whatever the way you choose, you have a view of the city, and you're able to get a dinner on the restaurant on the top with such view. Apart from that, is a simple TV tower, nothing special except for the colors which can be viewed in the distance. Plenty of padlocks from lovers, french bridge style, good place to go with your couple..."
143,5.0,"Been up twice now. The second time the clouds got in the way, but this is rare. The restaurant is really good and not bad value given the context."
144,5.0,"See the city at night,r type lift takes you up to top of the mountain lots of history there both recent and past.  The views were great.  Lots of locals.  Some neat traditions for those in love.  If you climb it it will take a while and allot of steps."
145,4.0,"take your time, walk from the Hyatt Hotel, through a beautiful garden, climb stairs in the forest, join the road, walk another 2 km, appreciate the view and arrive at the Namsan tower."
146,3.0,Seoul's north tower on Namsan mountain makes a pleasant excursion during the day or at dusk. It gives an excellent view of the whole ugly sprawling city spread over the mountains and down to the river with clear information displays and some restaurants too. But although the crowds were not that substantial it is nothing that special - until you compare it to any of the other attractions in Seoul!We caught the metro from our hotel to Chungmuro station on the orange line and then just outside caught a bus (number 2 or 5) which run frequently up to the tower.  Don't try to walk - it could take you an hour!
147,3.0,fun short cable car ride to reach tower in centre of lovely park with good walks never feels crowded
148,4.0,This is a Famous Tourist Object at the center of seoul.  Here we can go up at the tower and see the view of seoul city.  but another one that also famous is the Lock Love Key at the same location at the n seoul tower (Ground floor).  Here we can put a lock and put name of our couple and throw it away the key and most people believe their love will be eternal.. =)
149,5.0,This is the perfect place to go for a panarama view of Seoul. It is especially nice on a clear day. This is a fun activity for all ages.
150,4.0,It is a great place to visit in the evening time because of the view and the lights you can see The tower is nice and worth a visit Bring someone who knows Seoul and you will understand more about Seoul A good place that you should check out
151,5.0,One of the best spots in Seoul. Really amazing views of the city. Better visit early morning to avoid crowds and waiting time. A must place to visit.
152,5.0,You can see the big city up there.  There are many locks showing lovers' bond and promises.  I loved the beer at the lounge.
153,4.0,The tower offers a 360 panoramic view of Seoul. The ride up in the lift is a buzz - a bit like going at warp in the Starship Enterprise. The walk up to the tower however was a pretty tough climb. One wouldn't want to have heart problems.
154,4.0,"Breathtaking bird eye view. Friendly staff welcomes you till the top. Most importantly they reserved this greenery in the middle of Seoul and yet ""Must Go"" tourist attraction. Romantic place to propose too. Best to visit at any time. Wondering how and why Korean are slim and healthy?. hiking"
155,5.0,"Wonderful hike to the top of Namsang Mountain , and a good place to see Seoul from the top. A restaurant in the upper level is a nice caf√©."
156,4.0,Loved to go up the tower and see Seoul from above. Seoul is a busy incredibly organised and clean. Seeing from above you can really get how Seoul really is. The way up you have to get quite a lot of stairs.
157,4.0,"N Seoul Tower located on top of Seoul city,  have gondola sky view, tower view and terrace park view with Seoul city view. We can see the sunset and have a great time with familly or friends."
158,5.0,It is a must to understand how vast is Seoul. They have put the name ot many cities in the many windows on the  observation desk with their specific distance from Seoul. Nice initiative.
159,5.0,"Nice to have a view on the city. We went on a rainy day with less view. They show the direction and distance to other world cities when you walk  around, interesting.Our tickets were paid for by our host so I cannot tell if the price is reasonable or not.Dinner on the tower (Hankook restaurant); you pay for the view. Food is good but below Seoul high standards."
160,2.0,"This might have been an attraction years ago, but feels quite lame now. Nothing interesting to offer but a decent view; not cheap and nothing to do other than to go up the tower. Can skip."
161,5.0,"The view over the city was amazing, the montain and the national parc was dressed for autumn and it was really worh going here. The elevators are fast."
162,4.0,We were travelling late evening using cable car to get to the tower. Very comfortable and safe. Good view to night city. Cafeteria on the top is OK. Take-away memory - you can have 4-pattern tower view foto :) One of Seoul MUST VISIT places.
163,4.0,It is situated on hilltop and is the highest point of Seoul..it is also a part of Seoul sightseeing day tour..public transport bus also ply regularly on this route. The drive to uphill is really nice. One can go on hiking too a breathtaking view of the entire Seoul city from the Seoul tower is awesome.
164,4.0,Take the cable car up on a clear day to experience an amazing view of Seoul. Then check out the gallery and restaurants at the top. You can then take a gentle stroll down through the forest of the hill.
165,4.0,"If you want to look at the enormous size of Seoul you have to go there. Accesible by public transport, cable car or by foot. Admission is a bit expensive 9000 W but if you have the luck not to wait too long in line it is worth it. Charming locks at the top terrace, a local attraction for lovers."
166,5.0,"This was one of the highlights of our visit to Seoul. The line to board the cable car which takes you to the top of the hill was very long but it was well worth it. Once you get up to the tower, the view is breathtaking and the tower at night is beautiful. When it was time to get back down, we decided not to stand in line (once again, the line was very long) for the cable car and walk all the way to the bottom of the hill instead. I am glad we did, even if I have to give everyone fair warning: if you decide to walk down, wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for a rather long trek!"
167,5.0,"The Seoul Tower is located on probably the highest Hill in Seoul, You can reach it by Cable Car. The Tower offers the best possible views over Seoul."
168,3.0,"Not sure if it was just the day we got there but once up to the top, We couldn't  see much as it was very smoggy.  The ride to the top was one a minute. Small elevator but the line up was very short. It's interesting looking at the million of love locks."
169,4.0,Seoul tower is best in the night. U can get a taxi to the base from where you need to get to a cable car. The night journey in the cable car is spectacular over the thick trees with the surrounding illuminated city of Seoul.From there there is a high speed elevator to the top of the tower - over 200 metres which is completed in just over 30 seconds. There are restaurants where u can dine.
170,4.0,Enjoy a bird's eye view of Seoul from the upper viewing deck.  The lift takes you up in 30 seconds flat.  The place is crowded with lots of tourists
171,5.0,Revolving restaurant - must book. If walking a fair climb up the hill. Close to the Hilton. Recommended for the first timer to Seoul.
172,3.0,Best to visit during the day when the sky is clear but there's really nothing much to see or do there. Only 3 attractions including the tower i.e a teddy bear museum and padlock trees.
173,4.0,"The view is great. You can see Han river, some landmark buildings, hills. You can see various districts of Seoul, skyscrapers next to Yeouido Park, but there is not much more in it. Anyway, it's definitely worth the visit for the view."
174,4.0,"Access to the tower could be better as there is around a 200m walk up quite a steep hill with what seemed to be no disabled facilities. That said, this place has some amazing views.It might be worth trying to go during a clear day, and even towards the end of the say (as we did) as the sunset was incredible.Cafe with a view if for those that fancy a drink while there."
175,5.0,"A must to anyone's visit to Seoul.  From a bird's-eye vantage see this sprawling city of over 10 million people, see the new and old mixed together.  For those interested in history, one can even see the remnants of the old wall that once protected Seoul from invaders as it connected the mountains surrounding the city."
176,5.0,"Went here in the afternoon and evening.  Took the cAble car ride up.     Saw a great city view and thousaNds of locks placed on the fences, symbolizing a couples undying love for each other."
177,5.0,This is something to see when visiting Seoul. The views of the city from the top of the tower are breathtaking.  A highlight of our trip to South Korea.
178,5.0,The only thing better than the view from the top is the dining at the top! Well worth the taxi ride and initial walk uphill to start!
179,4.0,"I was in town with some colleagues and we decided to take a day trip to Seoul tower.  I recommend visiting if you are in the area, the views are spectacular.  The rest is similar to what you would expect for a tourist area, little shops and such.  Oh, and the restaurant in the tower, that is uber expensive.  We didn't feel like submitting an expense report with those prices!"
180,5.0,"The beauty stands so tall you can see it through out the day and looks awesome in the night. There are official timings to visit, so better check and visit."
181,3.0,"took the bus ride from the nearest metro station in the evening and it was a beautiful ride. Try to reach there in the evening so that you can enjoy it in day light and when lights are on.In my personal opinion it is not worth the money you spend to go up the tower, the view is much better from the hill top."
182,5.0,Be prepared for a pretty steep inclined walk to the tower. Appropriate footwear recommended. Once up there though it's spectacular 360 degree view of Seoul with amazing photo opportunities. Restaurants and sweet shop also available at the top of the tower.
183,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is located on a hill in the centre of Seoul. When standing next to the tower, it was not that impressive but placed on a hill, the view from the sightseeing platform is great.There are basically two ways to get to the tower: The long and curvy asphalt road, or climbing the narrow paths on the hillside. If you have time climbing the hillside is a great experience."
184,4.0,"N Seoul Tower is a korean landmark so expect a sea of people even when you think it's off peak season. the place is photogenic in all angles, even when it's jampacked. the walk uphill is not for the faint-hearted."
185,4.0,"Go up in the evening. Have a little dinner at the base of the cable car entry. Take the ride up and watch the sunset and the people. Take a padlock to add to the ""Lover's  fence"" near the base of the tower"
186,4.0,N Seoul tower is on top of a hill and to reach the top of the tower one can take a high speed lift. The view from top is fantastic. Please visit the following Blog http://papumashi.blogspot.in
187,5.0,"Like may cities that have a tower from which to best see the city, the Seoul Tower does not disappoint. It's a steep walk up a hill so wear comfortable shoes!"
188,4.0,"When in Seoul, you definitely should climb the hill and visit the tower to get an impression of the immensity of this city. For me it was really breath taking."
189,4.0,you can reach by bus or cable car (8000 won for return trip) last cable car at 11 PM depart from the towerits better you go there at night........................
190,4.0,"first of all, please prepare your best footwear (I suggest running shoes). once you reach the ""entrance"" of the N Seoul Tower, you will be welcomed with almost 40 Degree upward hiking track. you HAVE TO walk about 100 meters uphill.once you reach the check point, you will see quite spacy area. there are shops and cafe in this area. in the 2nd level of this area, there are lots of ""love lock"" hanging on the fence. you can take a selfie with nice Seoul city background.Or you can buy an additional entrance ticket for the observatoryfor different experience, try visit it in day and night.have a nice excursion in N seoul Tower"
191,4.0,Highly recommended for first time visitors to Seoul. The view is astonishing and there are plenty of space to relax and enjoy the view.
192,5.0,"Though it was rainy day it was a great pleasure to have a trip to Seoul Tower. The view is incredible, the nature is so so nice...Also there were some beautiful corners to see..So i highly recommend  do visit that while you are in Seoul.!"
193,3.0,We went probably on the wrong day. Saturday evening there were far too many people. Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting. And there are not much places to wait! About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor. By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory. So not sure if it was worth the wait.
194,3.0,The tower is a great way to overview the city. It's beautiful at night when they light up the tower. I would recommend using the cable car to get there if you're not afraid of heights.
195,4.0,"A good climb/walk for walking enthusiasts. The top is dominated by few cafes with exorbitantly priced food and drinks. But refreshing to reach the top, take pictures and have a nice cold beer and watch the world go by."
196,5.0,"I mentioned this when I did the review for the Namsan park but you have to pay to go up to the top and view downtown Seoul. You can also see the Blue House from there, which is the president's resident. Make sure to get some candies from the ""Weenie Beenie."" Scrumptous!"
197,4.0,"Lot of people want to get to the top. But it's a nice view. Went up not using cable car, no problem to get to the top."
198,5.0,Nice cable car ride and interesting lift ceiling video. Observation deck was crowded but one can still view the whole of Seoul city. Very romantic park at the top of the cable car station.
199,4.0,Obviously a nice view .  Seoul has a lot of fog some days so make sure to pick up the right day. Nice souvenirs to purchase.You can bring padlocks of love .I would say it's an average view  tower of any big city.You will enjoy !!!!!!
200,4.0,"Great 360 degree Seoul view from the Tower. Worth a visit, especially, if you hike up/down. Has quite a few places to eat & drink as well. Evening visit is definitely amazing."
201,5.0,"Modern landmarks include the iconic N Seoul Tower where riding the Namsan cable car becomes a welcome treat to be able to walk to the tower. Lovers can seal their lifetime promise through hanging locks that symbolizes eternal love as depicted in Korean television shows, dramas and movies. The Namsan Tower is located on Namsan Mountain which stamps the highest point in Seoul. It also features the Namsan Park and the Namsangol Hanok Village. The N Seoul Tower is considered as a popular representation of the city as it has the grandest panoramic view in all of Seoul."
202,4.0,"Bring your walking shoes and hike up the steps next to the old fortress wall area, on the way up you can stop and take some photos at an overlook, the finish with the North Seoul Tower.  lots of people (most take the bus or cable cars) I will stop back again just for the hike up and back down, plan to spend the day, lots to see if you walk through the town first."
203,4.0,"i stayed at the Hilton at the bottom of the hill from the tower and decided to walk through the park and up to the tower. This took about an hour and was some great exercise amid a typical business trip of sitting and more sitting. The views of the city were great during the walk, but nothing compared to the views from the tower itself. You can get food and drinks at the top, and there are some interesting vendors in that area. Even if you don't pay to go up the tower, the walk tot he top is nice and affords some great views;"
204,3.0,You have to go to the tower to look down on the city. I did it twice. Once during the day & the other a night. During the day they had a group of men dressed in old military traditional clothes demonstrating different fighting weapons.
205,4.0,"I had half a day off on a recent business trip and went up the hill to the Seoul Tower. I rode the gondola up, but it was a gorgeous sunny day, so walked back down. I and two colleagues met at the base of the tower and paid to ride the elevator up and have lunch. It was a little expensive but worth it for a delicious lunch and a fantastic view!"
206,5.0,"This is one of the must see attractions in Seoul. I went in the afternoon but despite being  a smoggy day, the views were spectacular. I decided to take a taxi to the CBD but walked to the tower, being an avid walker, and toured much of the surrounding area which also had some other fascinating attractions. Price was what you would expect and food was reasonable as well. I had a coffee at the top while taking in the great views of the city."
207,3.0,"Just another one of those tall towers where you can go up and see the view. Unfortunately was a cloudy day, so nothing much to see. No difference than Taipei101, Empire State Building or Eiffel Tower when you're up there, but lack the class and status to be on the same level as the abovementioned though."
208,5.0,"Great place for tourists, easy to come by taxi, great walk and great restaurant at the top with affordable lunch with great taste. Cherry blossom in April is amazing. Not too crowded during the day. You will need at least 3 hours to enjoy your time up there. The cable is slow but provides good experience."
209,4.0,"The climb is a little steep so be prepared for that.You can get the full tower view from the base where the tour bus would be parked.At the entrance you will be photographed and you can collect the same at the top, so be prepared beforehand.While on top you can visit your nation (with the capital) that would be giving you the distance to your  country from the tower and the direction. You can take snaps pointing out to your nation as a proof of your visit. The night view is awesome and you need to be prepared with a good flash on your camera to get a great snap."
210,5.0,"Soul Tower is a same as others in Macau etc, but the special about this tower is that it is located on Namsan Mountain, and believe me, this mountain is too scenic and beautiful. If you can walk, please do- so that you can enjoy most scenic, nature experience. Spectacular views of Soul city and Han River.Being in Soul, Do visit to Tower and Namsan Tower."
211,4.0,"The views from there are wonderful but in my opinion 63 Floors building it's better, especially at night because you can see the river"
212,5.0,The walk is up hill to the tower and parking is at best tight though I would definitively see this at night as the views are incredible.
213,4.0,"Although I usually avoid tourist attractions when traveling, this particular one turned out to be a good experience.  The tower is located in a nice park and a cable car takes you right up to the lookout platform.  There is some climbing involved, so wear comfortable shoes.  While we were there, there was a cultural performance that was entertaining.  There is also a gift shop inside with some nice souvenirs.  The best part, however, is the spectacular panoramic view of the city.  Be sure and visit on a clear day to take full advantage of this bird's eye view."
214,5.0,"The 'gem' of our trip to South Korea,spent the early afternoon and late evening , slowly taking this amazing view of this vibrant city from the highest point of Seoul, breathtaking scene of their river with my lovely wife on our 34th wedding anniversary !"
215,5.0,Very nice place to enjoy noght scenery.  You will see different color of tower according to the weather condition. This is one of the best place to see Seoul around. And funny rest room.
216,5.0,"The location of the tower is perfect, from the top you can enjoy the view of each side of Seoul city. I'd recommend to visit the place late afternoon, the sun will give nive light over the city and you can enjoy the view before going to the top, and get there around the sunset to see all the city light (for photographers; tripod is a must..).Getting to the tower is pretty simple and easy, no need to take the train unless you are lazy."
217,4.0,Great place to get your bearings of the layout of the city.Not for hazy day of which there are many in Seoul.
218,4.0,We took in a half day city tour that included the Seoul Tower. It was great to see how spread out Seoul is and how it is surrounded by mountains. Lots of young people place locks on the special trees near the tower entrance. It's about of a steep walk up to the tower but it's worth the effort.
219,4.0,"Today I visited the N Seoul Tower. I took the Seoul City Tour Bus daily ticket for 12,000 won which is about 12$. One of it's stops is the tower. Bought a ticket for observatory deck which normally cost 9000 won but due to my ticket of tour bus received a % 10 discount. Just before you enter the elevator they will take your picture which  Will be ready by the time you reach the top but you are not required to by it. The view on top is very good which is worth the money. The only claim I have is that the windows from outside were little bit dirty causing the pictures you take not perfect clear. There is also a souvenier shop ."
220,4.0,"Had to make this trip to N Seoul Tower during a business trip on a winter night (-10 deg) and during a winter sunny day (+1 deg),,, great view of the city from here, specially at night,,,"
221,5.0,"Beautiful tower on top of the mountain, overlooking Seoul. Go at the end of the day so you see it during daylight and also at night."
222,4.0,"I walked all the way up the hill taking 2 stops, and enjoying city views at different points and also greenery around. Once up, i went up the tower but it was very crowdy due to saturday. I enjoyed cold fountain at the base of tower, after long walk up the hill."
223,4.0,"was staying at the grand Hyatt, went for an early morning walk and walked up the hill to the tower. It's pretty touristy once you get up here but its worth it for the view. Take your camera. /"
224,3.0,"to get there, the bus and other car  will stop 500 meter from the towerand u walk and climb very high..so dont use highheel .dont forget to bring padlock , named it with your name an your partner, so the  love is everlasting."
225,5.0,"nice walk up, but much easier to catch #3 bus (Itaewon was my access).  Great views as you would expect of any tall perch!  I did not eat in the restaurant, look elsewhere for reviews there.  Twenty minutes is plenty at the top, the walk from the bus stop to the elevators is tough on bad legs, don't bother as it will only hurt you.  If you are able to walk a couple of hundred yards up to the elevators, it is great!  Spring or fall would be spectacular as Korea has so many beautiful trees!  We were in the dead of winter and still enjoyed the view."
226,5.0,We used the tram to reach the tower and it was the wrap of my visit to Seoul. I could see the old and the new seoul at the same time. There's a place for couples to put their gridlocks representing their longlasting love. Too bad i wasn't travelling with my couple :(
227,4.0,Unless you are looking for a workout take a bus up to the tower and enjoy a leisurely walk back down.  It's worth the trip and price for the view.
228,4.0,"This is landmark of Seoul I'd say.I've been many other tower all around the world.But, N-Seoul tower has something special thing.I recommend you to go there at night if you are considering to go.One thing that I don't like is, it's not that easy to access unless you are with local travel agency.Using public transportation is one good option, or you can take cable car to get the top."
229,5.0,"I visited the Seoul Tower in the late afternoon/early evening.  The ride up on the Gondola was beautiful, but the view once we arrived at the top was breathtaking.  We ate at one of the restaurants (there are many) and enjoyed a view as we ate, high atop the city.  The food was Korean, so the choices were somewhat limited since I cannot eat very spicy food.  However, there were enough items to satisfy me and it was a delightful evening."
230,5.0,You get a great view of the entire Seoul from the observation deck. There's also cultural shows during the day - a must see and visit!
231,4.0,N Seoul Tower is a unique place to visit while in Seoul.It's very interesting it see Seoul from such a high spot.Also an opportunity to put a lock of love or friendship to join the hundreds of thousands left by friends & lovers.I don't like the high cost charged by the cable car to reach the site which is very short ride.
232,4.0,The tower in itself is a great place to go to. It has several restaurants and eateries in the tower itself. The view from the top is simply amazing.
233,3.0,"I found that the best pictuires I took was from outside of the tower, i went there at night to have beautiful views and pictures. Views, ok, pictures, not so much as inside the tower, you got all the reflections of the windows in your pictures."
234,4.0,"When on the top of the tower, you can have fantastic views of Seoul City from different directions whether these are marvelous architecture, giant landscapes or even crawling traffic in a country of huge population density."
235,4.0,"There is very good laser show at N Seoul Tower , You get very good view of Seoul from viewers gallery . Lift is fast . Very good photographs taken by photographer although expensive . There should be more photographers so that there is choice to customer . Overall good experience and should visit when in Seoul ."
236,4.0,"Worth the visit to see Seoul from all sides. Helps one experience the breadth of the city. Huge! Beautiful views. Short walk but steep incline from the bus stop to the tower. Beware the souvenirs! :) Enjoy the Cold Stone Creamery ice cream after you've visited the top. Also, love seeing it from the city at night when its' lit up. Enjoy!"
237,4.0,"Seoul has about 20,000,000 in the immediate area and you can see where most of them live from the tower's observation deck."
238,4.0,"It was nice visiting N Seoul Tower. You get full view of Seoul from it ! A must visit for people visiting Seoul, Korea"
239,5.0,"Seoul Tower is a great place to visit. With amazing views, great restaurants and a lot of stairs going up from the base across the street from the Millenium Seoul Hilton. See if you can run up in less than 12 minutes. It's quite the exercise workout!"
240,3.0,"It's just a high building in a big park.Korean are sure know how to do Tourism, and they do good. From nothing, by putting stuff to it, they make it intro a quite interesting place to be.A quite fine place, but won't go again."
241,5.0,"The view is amazing. There is a video show on the tower, which is definitely to see!It was said that the restaurants at the hotel they were open until 10 pm but they were already closed at 9pm."
242,3.0,"I‚Äôm not usually a fan of this kind of attraction ‚Äì I don‚Äôt really enjoy spending my time queuing for tickets, being jammed into cable-cars, squeezing myself against glass for a nice view. But N Seoul Tower was one of the better of these kinds of attractions. I think because Seoul is such a sprawling, unimaginably expansive city --- it was fascinating to see the city splayed out in all its glory. We arrived just before sunset, so were able to see the city at both day and night, and I would strongly encourage this. The night views were interesting just because of Korea‚Äôs mini-obsession with neon, but personally I preferred the day-view. You could get a real sense of the topography of the land, including the beautiful mountains just behind the city."
243,5.0,The N seoul tower is a must visit. Recommended to go at sunset or night. it offers a 360 deg breathtaking view of seoul.
244,4.0,"For all couples and even friends and family this is the place you should not miss in Seoul. Though, avoid buying goodies from here as it is far costlier then local markets."
245,4.0,This is a fun place to visit. Not to be missed are the great views from the Tower especially on a clear day. You will need to do some walking and the place can get crowded with tourists.
246,4.0,Lots and lots of people in love bring or buy locks to leave at the tower as an expression of their commitment. Very charming and watching them is delightful. I went to the top and found the sights very interesting.
247,4.0,"we went there on a Saturday evening and the weather was extremely pleasant. We took a cable car ride to the top though I realized later that we could have climbed to the top and that would be quite some experience.It would be good if they mention the approximate time to stay in queue to get to the cable car ride as the visitors can decide whether they want to do this or not.At the base of the Tower, we had several food options and I liked the whole experience out there. There was a place where many couples came to ""lock""  thier love and longetivity of their relationship. There was a live band playing over there and the Light and Sound show in the Night was worth waiting for. We could not go till the top of the tower as they had a long waiting time of more than 1.5 hours. Wish we had known this at the entrance so that we could buy our tickets earlier."
248,4.0,"Liked: The views are fantastic from the observation tower. Take the elevator to the top. There is also the N Grill restuarant on top which is a great place to eat since it revolves. The dislike was that there was a very long wait to get to the observation tower and it was very crowded. If you come at the wrong time, you could be waiting up to one hour to get up and another one hour to get down."
249,4.0,"So I heard you can see North Korea from the top of the tower.  Perhaps, but it was unclear once I got up there.  Seoul is a vast city, and the tower is the only way to truely apreciate it.If you want to get there - ask at the info booth at any SMRT metro sation.  They will tell you which bus to take and where from."
250,4.0,"It was a very hot day when I went up the Tower, so it was quite hazy.  I'd like to go again on a clear day, as you must be able to see for miles."
251,5.0,"I visited Namsan Seoul Tower. It was quite interesting to have a look ""Teddy Bear Museum"" located in Namsan Tower. The Teddy Bear Museum has a wonderful combination of Teddy Bears old and new. Some of them were rare items. Teddy Bear Museum at Namsan Tower is worth while visiting.Tip: In Cherry Blossum Season (Spring) and in Autumn Leaves Season, the way to Namsan Tower is even more beautiful. I had coffee with my friend at Hyatt Hotel in Namsan and it was quite enjoyable with excellent views and with live music performances."
252,3.0,"Hard to get a day where it isn't foggy, although the view is decent, it's nothing that will leave you speechless.Good for an hour or two, don't plan your entire day around it though."
253,3.0,the view during the day is nothing like the evening city view. Going at the top of the tower with a date in the evening overviewing the city lighted is really something.
254,4.0,"When you say Tower....the thing comes to your mind is 360 degree City View.....but here is the Korean tradition of giving everthing a twist.As soon as you reach you are greeted with life performace of Korean Traditional Martial Arts.The ticket to the elevator comes with a guidebook and a wishing love coin for the love pond upstairs.As you stay in the line for elevator....a pic is taken with green background for you to take a copy of it with Night and Day view of Tower at a charge.The elevator has large viewing screen above...it is claimed to be fastest elevator in the world......Upstairs...you have highest cafe....highest post office.....wishing pond....a 360 degree viewing panel.Overall...they have created this as an ""experience"" than..a true viewing ecstasy......"
255,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is a television located in Namsan Mountain therefore it actual height is much higher than 236m of the tower itself. N tower is a famous place for visitor as well as Korean people where you can view the whole Seoul city. I got there 2 times, One time in the morning and see many people doing exercise by climming up the mountain to the tower, in which many old people (amazing). It is also a good place for Korean athletics train their strength. Another time visit the place was in evening after wandering in MyongDong. The tower is beautiful at night. There are many beautiful Korean and Japanese couples get there to take pictures and lock their love in the lock tree. I've got one there, and so far it works. So dont fogert the lock if you have chance to visit this place."
256,5.0,"this will give you a spectacular view of Seoul. romantic place to go to especially at night. what with the ""LOVE"" theme of the whoke park!"
257,4.0,Great place to go for a first time visitor. Try to go on a weekday because weekends are packed! Found the ticket and dinner package was good value. Amazing view at night.
258,5.0,"Picture perfect location, great views of the city and the nearby mountains. Wonderful sunset views. Lovers hang out spot.."
259,5.0,"This is one must see attraction of Seoul on a sunny day. If visibility is poo, please avoid it. The hill around it is very nice. Overall a great experience"
260,4.0,"If you'fre visiting the city. dont miss out on the Seoul Tower. A cable car ride to the top offers some excellent views of the city.Having visited after dark, I think this offers a better overall experience that if it was daytime. The venue was busy but not over crowded and the waiting times for the cable car and the lift up and down the tower were resonable.On site there are plenty of food / drink facilities, which I did not try personally but were popular with other visitors.Don't miss this one."
261,4.0,"Good night scenic view of Seoul, multiple affordable and somewhat average dining options. There are many events at plaza so check their website to make more memorable."
262,5.0,it's well worth to walk up or even take the gondola to the base of the tower. enjoy the view all around as well as signs how far it is to your home
263,4.0,"The tower has a relatively good restaurant with korean buffet one floor down from the main observation deck. Interesting view of the city, although it was snowing very hard so the view was not the best. On each window, there is a city in some far country with the distance from Seoul."
264,5.0,Superb views coupled with a variety of local and traditional displays at the foot of the tower. A great ride in the cable car to near the top but the last a bit is by foot up some steep steps ...not for the infirm or unfit!!
265,4.0,"Excellent way to see the city. Its worth walking up the hill for the views on the way, rather than taking a bus. The elevator to the top of the observation deck is also an experience..."
266,4.0,Very nice place to visit. A lot of people around so it gets crowded on the top especially in the evening as it is known as place for romance. But to walk up the hill and see the view worth it.
267,5.0,Great view.  Ok restaurant. The revolving restaurant very expensive. Elevator service very efficient. Worth the effort.
268,5.0,"Please note: to avoid climbing, you can take elevator-car from the street below the mountain (free), which takes you to the cable car station (payed), which in turn takes you to the tower base, where you can buy entrance to  even higher view (recommended)."
269,3.0,A trip to Seoul is not complete without going to the tower. The view is great (suggest you go at night) but there is nothing much to do once you're there.
270,5.0,"A great view of the city in either day or night.  Especially romantic on Valentines Day and take a lock with both of your initials to place on the fence and ""throw away the key""."
271,5.0,Well worth a visit but make sure you pick a clear day where you will be able to see for miles.  Got some excellent photos.  Also outside tower there is thousands of locks and love letters where couples declare their love to one another - very sweet!
272,5.0,"The Seoul Tower is highly recommended for your first trip to Seoul.  To get to the tower, you take a very cool cable car up a beautiful mountain (especially nice in spring or fall) and at the top there are normally traditional Korean dancers or performers.  From there, there are a few (slightly overpriced) restaurants and shops and the entrance to the tower itself.  From the top of the tower, you can see the whole city.  It is a great view.  Additionally, there is a tradition at the Seoul Tower that you and your honey write your names on a lock (like a padlock) and attach it to a big area of fence.  They say if you do that, then your love will never break apart.  It's sweet.  I am bringing my husband next year so that we can do this - I'm silly and sentimental like that ;)"
273,5.0,Take the cable car across to the Tower at night for full enjoyment of the view! crowds can be bothersome so go during the weeknights. Grounds are perfect for biking and walking. Exercize equipment located on grounds for the energetic.
274,5.0,"This is the right spot to view Seoul from top. You can reach the top using stairs, walking the road, car, bus, or teleferic (Cable Car)."
275,5.0,"A terrific experience going up the cable car, the walk to the top and unsurpassed views from the tower observation level.  Take your wife or partner with a padlock so you can fix it to the many thousands plus already there and make a promise of eternal love and affection.  If you use a combination lock don't forget to change it from the factory default setting as when we were there a wag and his girl friend were undoing the padlocks, moving them a metre or so and re-fixing - imagine the confusion on the owners return and inability to find their padlock...Taking my own engraved padlock on the next visit (and changing the combination)."
276,5.0,"You can go up and see all Seoul but to take pics it was a bit difficult as the windows were quite dirty. But the feeling it truly amazing. If your camera died down, don't worry there is Staff that takes Pics and you can buy them afterwards. There is an really good italien/french Restaurant on the first floor (just around the corner after the exit) with a really nice Sunset to look at with Seoul in front of you!"
277,5.0,"We walked up to the tower by way of the steps through the park from the subway station.  Its a demanding hike, but enjoyable.  At the top, we found thousands of ""locks"" attached to each other and to a boundary wall of an observation deck.  My memory flashed to an episode of ""The Amazing Race"" and I recalled the contestants receiving a key and having to discover a single lock among these tens of thousands that fit.  That was a fun bit of connection.  This is a popular location and can be accessed via the walk up, or there is a cable car.  The tower is immense and at night its curved sides are used as screens for a multitude of projectors that bring video scenes to life, changing the tower's colors, using different patterns, etc.  We went up to the observation deck and had dinner at a Korean buffet restaurant.  We stayed here until dark and watched the lights of Seoul begin to shimmer and shine through the smoggy atmosphere.  This was the brightest and most attractive the city appeared during our whole visit.  (The men's restroom atop the observation deck has huge plate glass windows as walls looking out over the city.  The urinals are placed here so that as you relieve yourself you are looking out over the cityscape.  Very odd sensation!)  The only hitch is leaving the observation deck level, as a line forms for the elevators but it moves quickly and soon you are at the tower base and must decide how to get back off the hill.  We opted for a bus over another long stair way and got out at the subway station and quickly found our way to our lodgings."
278,5.0,"Loved the cable car, stairs and ride up; well-kept grounds and shops at the top. I did not like the cheezey video in the elevator that the attendant insisted we watch - she barked at a member of our group to look up and watch it after she had made it clear it made her dizzy. Trust us to make our own decisions.  The locks and hearts of couples was fun and the park at the base a nice place to spend a cool couple of hours. Go early enough (5-6pm ish)so lines are less for the dark night sky viewing.  Large steps up and down, from cable care to park base, so workin the calf muscles and the knees. Be careful.  I did not go to the Teddy Bear Museum, so have no opinion. Burger bar inside the tower had awesome hamburgers. Pricey at $7 but we splurged as it was 4th of July."
279,4.0,"nice place on the hill top. need to climb a steep slope to reach from the bust stop. Good scenery, Can see North Korea beyond the mountains. Can see the seoul city from the top. Good food also available there."
280,4.0,"The tower offers great views of the city. I found the hike up through Namsan Park even more fun, but you can also arrive/depart via cable car."
281,4.0,"The street up to the cable car station is quite steep, so if it's hot it's a good idea to take the free elevator which goes from the main street right below the station. The cable car runs every 10 minutes. The park around the tower is clean and cool. There was no queue to get up in the tower - which was very nice. The view is very good - you really get an implession on how large the city is."
282,2.0,"Although a big attraction for tourists, most people in Seoul have not visited. The cost is high, the view usually diluted by the weather, smog, rain, clouds. The gondola station not well vented and they stuff people on these very slow gondolas. The elevator ride up is a gimick.  Pretty useles.."
283,5.0,"You cannot afford to miss this beauty-it stands elegantly,affording a bird's eye view of the Seoul city.If time permits,have a cappuccino on the cafe located at the very top.You can also invest in a photo souvenir when you are atop the tower.Don't forget to miss the Love Wall at the base of the tower,covered with locks of all shapes and sizes-symbolizing the locked love of millions."
284,5.0,"When I show guests around Seoul, Namsan is a must. Whether you go up the tower or not should depend on the weather. On a clear day it is well worth it, however, on a day with limited visibility you are just as well off staying on the ground.   Views from Namsan and the tower are even more stunning at night when Seoul lights up beneath you. However, you should be aware that the main viewing platform is closed off at around 10-11pm.  The easiest way to get up to the tower is to take the Number 2 bus from Chungmuro station on line numbers 3 and 4. The cable car from near Myeongdong is a romantic option, although it is a little more expensive. The restaurant at the top of the tower is good for special occasions, and the food served is excellent."
285,4.0,"Excellent location, can be very crowded in the evening. Lots of place to hang around"
286,3.0,"lots of petlocks.....thousands or millions. quite a distance uphill walk from Myeongdong st to the cable car st.i feel it was just a journey to the top and for phototaking at the petlocks trees , sunset, N Seoul Tower landmark.recommended once only unless you already make a lifelong promises of love here :)"
287,4.0,Best attraction in Seoul - especially if you come with a partner...
288,5.0,"It's a ""must visit"" place in Seoul! You can have panorama view of the city, enjoy the pure, natural atmosphere and share wonderful moments with your lovers locking your love locks. I've been here 3 times and I have a love lock here hihi"
289,4.0,Cheesy but romantic especially if you've watched plenty of Korean drama's. There;s sufficient entertainment up there too with performances (cultural)
