1,5.0,The very quick elevator trip was the best as there were LED screens inside where a video is played to entertain the audience. And the drop off point is on the 117th floor where the view of the whole city can be seen. You can go up to the 123rd floor and each floor offers different activities.

Do walk on the glass floor which is scary and thrilling at the same time. Since its way high up, you can see have a great view all round. Great experience"
