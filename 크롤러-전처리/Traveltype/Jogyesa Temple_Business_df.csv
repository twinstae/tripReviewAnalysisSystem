0,5.0,Worth a visit. The restoration is amazing. Understanding these ancient buildings is difficult for westerners. Beautifully maintained and the new museum is woth the entry alone. Lot of kids on excursions but they a respectful and keep out of the way.
1,5.0,"Jogyesa is a beautiful temple with impressive Buddha statues. The decorations in the temple are intricate and the courtyard is beautifully lighted up. We landed up in the evening when there was a prayer service going on and we witnessed the local people performing their prayers. The chants accompanied by the drums have a calming effect. The temple is right next to Insadong, the best place for souvenir shopping in Seoul."
2,4.0,"Visited when I did a trip around Seoul, there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to visit a temple and this was worth seeing"
3,4.0,"The Jogye Order is the biggest Buddishm sect of South Korea. And this place is their headquarters, located in central Seoul.The palace itself is not very big. But it would be nice to take a visit and see how locals pray and pay respect at this place. Take a visit when strolling around Insadong."
4,5.0,This temple is just siting on a main road close to the palaces.  Full of people making devotional offerings and some eye catching decorations.
5,5.0,"This temple is the main one of the Buddhist Order, Jokye-Jong. Chosun Dynasty worshipped Confucianism and surpressed Buddhism whereas Shilla and Korea Dynasty worshipped Buddhism. There were rarely Buddhist temples in the center of capital city during Chosun Dynasty whereas there were many Buddhist temples in the center of capital city, Kyung-Joo and Kae-Sung during Shilla and Korea Dynasty."
6,5.0,The temple is colorfoul and silent in the center of a crowded metropole. A visit is worth it. But please respect the praying people and don't take pics from inside.
7,3.0,"This temple is centrally located in the Insadong area. There is an attached store. If you have seen big temples in other countries, this will be a dissappointment."
8,3.0,Mesmerizing just to see the large Buddha statues. And even feeling more at peace while worship was ongoing.
9,5.0,"Visited the temples during a chrysanthemum festival, so the grounds were beautifully decorated with colorful flowers. The grounds were a nice oasis in the middle of the city, but was not exactly peaceful due to the crowds. Our group scheduled time to speak with a monk for a tea ceremony and a short lesson on mediation which was nice. We also ate lunch across the street, served buffet style, which was the best vegetarian meal I have ever had. The meal was a diverse combination of flavors and used ingredients like black sesame pastes that I have never tasted in vegetarian meals. I was overall very impressed with the whole visit and would recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul."
10,5.0,"It is not easy to reach the temple, it is hidden, Follow the map and then ask the people. The vist is definitely worth the trip!"
11,5.0,"The grounds and inner temple are a must see. Beautiful, colorful and dynamic setting. I was offered a cup of warm lotus tea while there, a welcoming and devotional atmosphere. This is a working temple so be mindful and respectful of devotees on grounds."
12,5.0,We arrived here just as they were beginning a prayer service and were encouraged to participate. Even though I didn't understand what was happening it was refreshing to see so many people on their knees (on mats- provided) involved in a simple act. The temple is ornate and yet very simple. You are not allowed to take photos inside although it is open on the sides. I would come back here again- it is very moving
13,5.0,We stayed at the Inter-Continental Hotel and this Temple was located just across the street.  It is a lovely Temple and is a very spiritual experience as so many local people worship here.  I'm SO glad that we went.
14,5.0,It is center of Jogye buddhism sect. It is the temple first located inside of Seoul Fortress Wall. This means great temple which come inside the 'Confusionism society' despite the 'promotion of confucianism pressing buddhism'  Please visit together with Changdeokgung palace and Insadong. :)
15,4.0,Beautiful small temple. Right next door to Insadong and Somerset Palace Hotel. There were lots of gorgeous flowers when I visited. My tour guide said they change them every season.
16,4.0,I found this almost by mistake and it was a very peaceful place despite being fairly central and next to the main castle grounds. There was a Buddhist service going on so I didn't want to disturb it and only have had a quiet stroll peeking politely inside. It is a living temple and you can see people inside as well as outside of it. There is small lily pond next to it and small gardens with large leafed flowers adding to the quaint aura. There is a fascinating pattern above your head made of paper (I think) fish that are arranged into flowing shoals. I'm not sure what they are but my guess is that these may be some kind of thank-you figurines or wishes brought in by the praying people. A very nice place to spend a quiet moment after the hustle and bustle of Seoul.
17,4.0,"Glad I stopped by this temple.  There is something magical about it. The architecture is beautiful. There are many people partaking in prayer services, however one can still get close and enjoy the temple. There are some cars allowed to park right in front, and some shacks around it.  That needs to be cleaned up, however should not deter one from visiting."
18,3.0,"Are you interested in Korean Buddhism? Jogyesa temple is the center of Zen Buddhism in Korea, located in the center of downtown. Most of Korean temples are located in mountains and remote places from the city. Likely Bongeunsa temple in Gangnam, the southern part of Seoul, you can easily visit this temple. Worships are held 3 times a day and you can look around  Buddhist museum inside Jogyesa temple to understand Korean Buddhism better, for free."
19,3.0,"Jogyesa Temple the is HQ of the Korean Zen and it is centrally located, between Kyungbukgung Palace and Insadong. Current temple was founded in 1910, on a much older site. The main hall contains three large golden statues and there are few subsidiary buildings, including a bell tower but access is restricted. About 10 minutes should be enough for a visit. It is a small but peaceful spot. It is hard to believe that Jogyesa Temple represents one of the richest monastic orders and the site of violent struggles over the control of the sect about 15 years ago, involving the riot police."
20,4.0,"lots going on when I came though in April and the whole courtyard was decorated in hanging lanterns , hundreds of them, and there was also a free concert daily. Very entertaining."
21,4.0,"This is the headquarters of the largest Buddhist sect in Korea.  The temple is very impressive and it has been recently come out of a two-year renovation project.  The temple grounds usually offer something of interest and it is definitely a place to check out during New Year's and Buddha's Birthday.  On other days, it can offer a nice respite from downtown north Seoul madness.  The temple itself is fairly modest since there is only two traditional buildings with the main hall only worth checking out.  There are some modern buildings next to it that house the Buddhist bureaucrats and some modern auditoriums."
22,5.0,"An extremely beautiful temple in the heart of the city, it takes your breath away and if you get lucky, as I did, to visit it during chrysanthemum festival, you will fill your soul with pure beauty."
23,4.0,"This was my second visit to this temple.  The first time was winter, so it was a bit bleak.  Today I went during the Chrysanthemum Festival and was awed.  Thousands of colorful flowers, many more people and a really festive feel.  I've not gone inside the temple, but much can be seen from the outside."
24,5.0,"I really enjoyed my visit to this temple, but could not stay as long as I would have liked, as I was on a rush-rush 1 day tour. I wished the tour guide would have been quieter, and let us enjoy the ambience a little more- she was an awful motormouth. I only had a limited time to explore Seoul, so could not return later. A shame..."
