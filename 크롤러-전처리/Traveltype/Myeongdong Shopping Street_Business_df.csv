And if you need Won, those small currency exchange kiosks in Myeongdong have very favorable exchange rate, as long as you have 100 dollar bills. With 100 USD bill, you will get within 1% of the daily exchange rate. But with 50 dollar or smaller bills, they might ding you, could be 5% to 10% less of the exchange rate."

Still lots of cosmetic shops along the street but at least this time the staff are not that pushy, and more friendly!"
73,2.0,"Myeongdong is famous for cosmetics and skin care shopping. It certainly spans across a large area, although I did find that most stores were repetitive and so, competition among business units can be quite strong. This area sure is a visual treat at night when street food vendors and store promoters are up and about their business. You will get lost at some point. I would be careful of the promoters who can get quite aggressive when distributing their free samples (I got hustled by one and was absolutely shaken by the experience)."

83,5.0,"That's a really great experience - to come in the evening to have a couple of bites of a local food. And to watch locals, who are so different and bright."
84,5.0,"Myeondong is one of those places, like many in the world, in any city, where the buildings, shops, alleys form a natural myriad of organically developed hustle and bustle of trade, residence and worship. A visitor cannot feel but overwhelmed by the closeness of these alleys which the senses are slathered with music, drooling smells of food, lovely retail assistants in many types of attire to entice you to walk into the shops. Where you have small but well stocked shops on both sides of the alleys and in some broader ones, have another two rows of carts selling everything from BBQ corn to children's socks. The residents who used to live here must have had close intimate relationships because of the proximity of one type of shop, food and service. Of course, there is some gentrification where more retail shops have popped up. Yet you find quaint shops from a Pet Cafe ( yes literally pay for time with different dogs to lie on your lap) to BBQ skewered meats, to strawberries dipped with chocolate, buns covered with pigeon eggs to famous Korean seafood cuisine and fine dining. And mind you, this is what you see at eye level. Most buildings have hidden gems of restaurants and retail in the upper levels. Your sight must rise above the usual man's height and look up, look around, look down to basements to find , explore and enjoy. And Myeondong continues to sparkle throughout the 4 seasons yet it has within this district, connected by major train lines, hotels surrounding it a most famous Catholic Church. When the Pope visited Seoul, this was the church he conduct mass at. Trip Advisor does not have enough space for me to continue with the many woven stories of good food, cute things to buy, fun people to watch. The thing is, one gets immersed into Myeondong ( Literally meaning Bright Cave) and need only emerge out of this district to fly home. Discover your own story."

87,5.0,Had a few hours to kill. Heard about the legendary Korean skin care and face masks which one has to buy as they make great gifts. This area was teaming with shops selling face masks and skin care products. Some shops have In-House VAT refund counters. But what I absolutely loved was the street food ! Tonnes of stalls selling mouth-watering food. Had the best freshly squeezed pomegranate juice. Great way to spend a few hours.
88,4.0,"Bring enough money or be disciplined not to spend at all 😊 the street food is not that affordable but I guess this is meant for tourists anyway. It all start from 3000 krw and a skewer of sausages cost 4000 krw or SGD5. There were plenty of cosmetic products and sales persons were aggressive. They could come close to you, handed you some samples and attempt to pull you in to the shop for shopping. So just shake your head if you're not interested. I'm pretty good at that towards the end of my first night 😊"

In th street markets I wanted to purchase some key ring fluffy rabbits, cost in the market was $14,000 (won) for 1 and $3,000 (won) each but I did need to buy at least 7, which is what I needed anyway, so saved so much money.  Most of the items in the wholesalers are out in the street markets so go save some money in their - heaps of jewellery too but most places you'll need to buy 10+ items.Loved all the different types of food stalls - from the amazing huge ice cream for just $2,000 won, huge smashing balls, giant meatballs plus another dish which I'm not sure on the name but it's like a small sweet pancake for $1,000 - definitely wish I had more of these, one just wasn't enough!"

The shops are mainly for cosmetics and skin care items which are so different than what we have in the USA. But there are also some other types of shops and many places to eat.  Just a fun place to be in the evening. Go!! Seems to stay open until about 11 or 1130 PM."

There is also a great food market here which is amazing to see. The only thing about Myeongdong is you have to have TONS of time to search and always bargin! I believe the Korean term for 'give me a deal' is 'gacka juseyo!' which they find hilarious. I lived here 2014-2015 teaching English and made sure to bring my family here when they visited.

It used to be a great place to come for shopping and eating but there isn't anything special that sticks out in my mind. Might be worth a quick visit to check the box but I would spend time elsewhere.

It's impossible to make your way through the whole thing in one visit unless you make an entire day out of it.. But you really could.. The best street food from sweet bread with eggs over easy to cheese bbq on sticks with honey drizzle.. Everything I put in my mouth was better than the last. Don't forget the mile high ice creams along the walk.. Plenty of souvenir shops and even places where you can dunk your feet to have little fish eat off the callouses.. It's everything you could ever want in a street market and more!!! A+"

This whole area is a long strip of all kinds of retail stores and malls. It is a day long trip or a few trips to get the entire taste of the place. The best part of the area is the street food. I recommend to try everything out. Enjoying delicious street food is a birth right for Koreans and is taken very seriously. Everyrhing I have had is delicious and my husband and I have tried it all. Cheap, delicious food for snacks! There are food courts in the malls as well. And they are all worth a visit. Shopping and excellent food all in one wonderful place, what more can one need!"

180,3.0,"It's not really the mecca of shopping as only mostly cosmetics and clothing are sold here. I wouldn't call it a food paradise either because I can find better eateries in Insadong. But it's certainly a magnet for the younger crowd, especially at night. This area comes alive after 7pm. Street food (mind you, they are not 'cheap', starting from 2,000 won for a tiny bun) abounds and you will be tempted to try everything! Stand along the shops and watch people pass by. It's filled with tourists!"
181,5.0,Great place to visit especially if you love the night life and bargaining as well as the endless rows of street food. Bring lots of cash.
182,3.0,You can walk up  from the area of the Seoul central station . It might take you  30 minutes to reach the ground floor of the tower and then book your elevator ticket . If you are there in April then The way will be surrounded by nice  blossoming sherry trees .

185,5.0,I'm not a shopper but I loved the vibrant atmosphere and the food being prepared by the street vendors. I visited a dog cafe and a cat cafe while I was there. Really enjoyed the people-watching. It would be shopper's paradise.

189,3.0,"If you're a tourist here, it's worth stopping by on your way to Seoul Tower, but the it's SO crowded, it's not really the greatest place to spend a lot of time. I prefer to do more of my shopping in Hongdae and other areas around Universities that have smaller shops and you don't have to weave your way through jam-packed streets."

193,2.0,"and this didn't really cut it for us. Nothing like the markets you'd get in other Asian cities. On the other hand if you are a shopper, you might be in heaven!"
194,4.0,Overall great shopping experience - no issue in language as most shops offer sales assistant who speaks chinese -  however some shops sales assistant were fairly pushy - keep pushing for bulk buying and if you are not buying in bulk they were quite reluctant to help further..
195,3.0,"The smells and noise of a busy shopping area where you can buy various assortments of food from street vendors. It's even great just watching them prepare the food whether it be deep fried squid or meatballs to pancakes with chocolate and banana it is a fantastic experience. As for the main shops. If you are in dire need of aloe or snail face masks this is the place for you...really!  Every other shop sells the stuff!  No wonder the locals don't have a wrinkle between them haha!  There are clothes shops, main chains, and they are no better prices than the UK or US. I was looking for a tech shop and after an hour of searching gave up hope. Ended up buying a face mask for the camera instead!"

211,4.0,The street is full of shops and I find very interesting as I can find many Korean products. Take the subway to visit.
212,3.0,"Myeongdong is alive at night. Bright lights coupled with street full of shoppers are a common sight. There are street hawkers which add on to the shopping experience. However, shopping can get a bit boring when all the shops are selling the same products on a different brand name. It is not uncommon that the same brand is operating on different alley in Myeongdong. I think it's a good experience to visit Myeongong to complete your skincare shopping list and satisfy your hunger."
213,3.0,"This place really comes alive at night. Check out the street food stalls for just a few Won. The beauty shops are all next to each other, each with salespeople offering free face masks to lure you in the store."

215,3.0,"It was pleasant strolling Myeongdong on Sunday; however, after 1pm, the pushcarts (mainly selling food) start to set up and the crowd starts to swell so it becomes congested which adds to the hype of the place. Try the Milky Bee rose ice cream gelato - it's good !"

Allow me to add that there are plentiful of cafes; and street food which opens from about half five; and there are many red-gowned tourist ambassadors who help you with directions (including to the downtown tax refund centers, of which there are many!!!); and there is also a stage where really high-quality art performances are held periodically."
218,5.0,"A great little sushi bar located in the shopping area. great shopping for younger people, bit pricy though. Walking distance from most city hotels."
219,3.0,There are better markets in Seoul to explore... This one is quite average. If you don;t have much time in Seoul - Skip this one.
220,3.0,"Visited a couple of times during a 5 day trip to Seoul and since I've gotten into Korean beauty products, Myeongdong was on my must-list. The place itself is insanely packed with both tourists and locals. Most of the stores are repeats (ie multiple Etude House, Missha, Nature Republic, Innisfree, Tony Molly) but I can't tell if they are independently run because your experience varies but the products and prices are the same. There are a few that were not as ""mass"" such as Shara Shara and Mediheal (both of these stores' staff I found were nice and helpful!). If you go, bring lots of patience and get used to the idea of being followed/hounded by sales people (can't be quite claustrophobic to westerners used to ""personal space"") and trying to sell you packages of facial sheet masks in the dozens (I was looking for personal use not for re-sale).  Most of the staff are nice and really just want to help (most don't speak English though). The exception seems to have been the massive Nature Republic near Uniqlo by the main entrance. Not only did the sales lady follow me around but apparently I was too slow to decide to buy anything so she took my basket away and basically pushed me out (oh and the ""free"" gift in the basket that they push on to you as you enter because apparently it's only for buyers. I wouldn't have been so peeved if I hadn't bought many other products from the same store the day before. If you go, go for the experience (the street food was good too) but be warned. Except for a few relatively 'unique' stores that's harder to find elsewhere like Shara Shara, all the other stores can be found everywhere else in Seoul where it's less crowded. I'd probably skip next time. Like another reviewer said, Lotte Department store in Myeongdong may be a better option (the duty free shop is even crazier though!) where you'll find the higher end beauty products that's hard to find outside Korea."
221,4.0,a good place for bargain shopping/ night life/ food. a must for leisure travelers. Evenings are crowded and entertaining.
222,5.0,"This is the place to shop in Seoul - where the locals go! Unlike in Gangnam, prices here are reasonable and if you know how to bargain its a plus."

224,4.0,"Happening side for shopping especially korean cosmetic products. All type of facial mask, cream, losyen from tip of hair to toes. Cheap allovera gel and if lucky enough to collect free samples. Paradise shopping for teenage or  those K - Pop fans. A bit high end shopping with moden style and lighting compare to near by Namdaemun street market."
225,4.0,"My local hosts & I went to an early performance of the cooking Nanta show which entailed fighting through the traffic and shoppers to find the theatre and a similar experience afterwards when leaving.Indeed we attempted a short shopping spree after the show in the Myeondong area, but this being a Friday evening the place was packed. If you want to see an orderly but still chaotic blend of street stalls, street food and high class department stores then this is the place to head for."
226,5.0,"At night, this is really something to see. In the middle of all the cosmetic stores, there are vendors selling everything from chunks of watermelon to BBQ to tempura."

Best time is late afternoon when all the food stalls are out and the you are truly in amongst the hustle and bustle of everything.

Walking distance you will also fine the big departments stores, Lotte and Shinsegae.  Expect large crowds and at least a couple of hours, but visit."
237,3.0,"Like: how easy to come here and how many types of food, clothes, headwear to facial stuffs you can get here. Most of the beauty shops here do sales and willingly give a lot a lot of freebies, the more you buy, the more freebies you'll getDislike: Beware of people pushing around. Street food too very over price for a stick of potato cost 3USD, better go for a meal in nearby restaurant. Too much of shops that are the same. Too repetitive"
238,4.0,"You can get most of your cosmetics and skin care here, like a heaven to ladies! However, most of the people here speak Chinese (due to large number of Chinese tourists) you actually don't feel like you are in Seoul."
239,4.0,"this is one of my favorite place. full of shopping store from make up, appareal, parfume to food stall, almost everything you looking for is in here.Once you reach Myeongdong, don't missed the ""egg cake"", the taste is a little bit unique yet tasty. beside that, don't forget ""Odeng"", skewer fish cake with spicy soup, and there is many more street food you could try in Myeongdong.since this place so huge, one day will never be enough to exploring this shopping area."
240,3.0,"This a place that you can find all the things, but mostly some gaget, with good price, for eletronic consumers this is paradise :)"
241,3.0,"While other areas such as Honde and Garosu are more charming and relaxing, Myeongdong is fascinating, with its bustling mix of large dept stores and street shops. It is very touristic (esp. Chinese tourists) but with flavors of real Korea. Particularly enjoyable are the street food stalls."
242,2.0,"The area is full of street food stalls, restaurants and cosmetic shops, and Korean teenagers. Unless you are also a teenager there are much better areas in Seoul for dining and shopping (and also for street food)"
243,3.0,I enjoy shopping at the Myongdong street as compared to the Shopping mall. its 11 storey high but at the duty free area is full of tourist shopping local cosmetic.
244,2.0,"I strolled through this district one evening and found it both overwhelming and disappointing. The streets were packed with shoppers carrying multiple shopping bags. The stores looked like typical chain stores of youthful fashion in the US. Every other store seemed to be a cosmetic store with aggressive sales ladies hawking beauty products at the door. If your idea of a cultural experience is walking through a gigantic outdoor shopping mall then rock on. Otherwise, I'd skip this and seek out other areas of the city with more pleasant experiences. I did find some very nice things in little shops in the Bukchon historic district - which is a very nice place to wander."
245,4.0,The place to go if you're a shopaholic! A few big malls within each other with Doota! being the best for fashions. Opens til wee morning!
246,4.0,"This is a great place to just shop until you drop! This is not your high end shopping. This is where you will find everything from socks to mink coats but they are not in bright lights and marbled floors but street stalls. I love going here. You can also bargain with them. If you do not like the price then just walk away, if they can go down more they will call you back, if that is their final offer they will let you go. Silk purses, beautiful bedding, clothes galore, shoes. Purses are a big thing. Most of the time it will not be the ""real thing."""
247,5.0,A must visit place at Seoul if you like cheap shopping... The streets are filled with varieties of commodities at a very cheap price... But there's a great scope of negotiating as none of the products are fixed priced... The place is just by the subway station...
248,4.0,Must visit for cosmetics and beauty care products. Reasonably priced and lots of choices. Easy to get through via public transport.
249,5.0,"I travelled alone on a business trip. Went to meyong dong and these streets are amazing. Very crowded but i was the only western on the streets. Felt absolutely safe and at home. Many restaurants, both traditional and KFC/outback steakhouse. Many cosmetics shops, many food stands. Really enjoyable evening!"
250,5.0,"Constantly evolving, Myeongdong is one of those places that deserve a seasonal visit.  The crowd is what makes Myeongdong shine and depending on the state of the currency exchange rate of nearby countries, you will find yourself in a flood of either Japanese or Chinese tourists plugging up the hundreds of shops and restaurants in this dynamic area.  The best feature, however, is the street food that line up the pedestrian only streets."
251,5.0,"I went down to Myeongdong with a colleague one evening while in Seoul. The shopping environment was certainly high-energy! There were skin-care shops and other shops galore, and the pedestrian-only walkways had many interesting kiosks down the middle, peddling anything from socks to street food. Good fun!"

254,4.0,"A place to be for lady like for me. I can get every cosmetics, beauty products that I wanted. From every Korean brand there is. ask for sample products, but beware dont be swayed when they say its free. (check before paying, because I almost get cheated.

256,3.0,"So many shops to see... So many were the same. Skincare, shoes, souveniers. We were there at the end of the night. It was really busy, still. I enjoyed the browsing but I was really tired. I should have some earlier in the day when I had more energy. I did buy some slug/snail cream. It's all the rage!"
257,5.0,"Responding to the call of freebies and discounts had me shopping my heart out for beauty products, apparel, shoes and accessories!

258,4.0,"There are lots of cosmetic stores and you can enjoy there to seeing very interesting things.   also there are lots of rests around and n the night, there are lots of street foods, so you can enjoy eating on the street too."
259,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this area.  It is so crowded all the especially with tourists from the world over.  That is fun in a way but also makes for congrsted and kinda messy experience.  I like going to the large Uniqlo here for t shirts and stuff.  Overall it has lots of cosmetics, shoe stores, clothing stores, etc. for a more youthful crowd.  And to s of restaurants including the famous Myeongdong Gyoza."

262,5.0,"Great choice, hot fashions and always good for people watching. The only negative is that some chains have several of the same stores. Certainly more beauty shops and coffee shops per square meter than anywhere else in the world plus the new fashion Green Tea shops"
263,4.0,"I like this street because they have everything you need for a shopping. Many options and cheap stuff with good quality. what i dislike about this place is it is too crowded it seems this place never sleeps. but, good to visit some time :)"

265,3.0,"Many street stalls like Dongdaemun selling snacks, knick knacks in front of brand name 2-3 storey shops like Face Shop, etc. Nothing truly spectacular except great bargains on facial products and street wear. One special snack - egg in sponge cake."
266,5.0,"A good place, if you enjoy the hustle and bustle of shopping, lots of variety in consumer goods and lots of variety of food. Good place to cosmetics"
267,4.0,"It is a huge area that in the evening really turns into a market in every street as cart vendors arrive with their replicas or pirate merchandise of things such as burberry, louis vouitton, gucci socks, shoes, scarfs, throws, headband, pony tail holder, etc. etc.  Some of the carts have prices, which I suggest you buy there as where there is no price when you ask they gave you a higher price that the one they gave to Korean people.  Just for an hour or so is fun to visit it.Also in the area there are lot of stores of skin care products."
268,4.0,"Do you like shopping? Then go to Myeongdong, the most trendy and stylish shopping street in Seoul. If you are not so interested in shopping, you can visit Myeongdong Cathedral, stamp museum, Seoul Global Cultural Center, Kimchi making experience center and more, all located in Myeongdong,"

271,4.0,"This place has both, the small road side shops and branded outlets. There are quite a few cafes and eateries too. I personally found this place better than the Namdaemon market."
272,4.0,"I enjoyed an evening stroll through Myeongdong. Now, there are lots of repeat stores. SkinFood and GaceTime and the other cosmetic shops have locations every few blocks. But, its interesting to just stroll and check out the stuff and people. If you're in a hurry -- this is the wrong place! I took a list from BBC or CNN of the best ten skin products for women and bought my wife and daughter several each. You do find good specials and they gave me lots of ""samples."" Prices on US and Euro brands are higher here. But, it was well worth an evening."

275,4.0,"Shop all day. Go crazy. That's what Myeong Dong (and nam dae mun) is for. With so many different shops around, you can not , not find what you want. Free samples for cosmetic (face shop, holika etc... too many to mention) are given when you go in the shop. Just take, walk in, no qn asked."
276,5.0,"Wow - this area has every type of shop you could want, from high and medium end international chains, to some small cute boutiques. If you're a dedicated shopper you can easily spend a whole day here. There is also no end of places to eat when you need to rest your feet and get some energy.The area is incredibly busy and crowded so be ready for some serious hustle and bustle. It's totally worth it for the great shoes and handbags!"
277,3.0,Big market having local stuff. Don't think of quality. Having 10000 KRW stuff but all are local and very cheap quality. If you want quality than you have to pay 3-4 times higher than standard prize.
278,4.0,Every second shop was Beauty shops where you can see most of the Seoul people shopping all thru the day !

No need for further introductions, upon arrival in Seoul, get a taxi and shop till you drop.  Visited last Sep-12 during ""Experience Hyundai"" trip."
281,3.0,"This is the place where you can get pretty much everything. From shops selling tourist knick knacks to cosmetics to household items. Food galore too. Lots of korean food options in the little lanes. They have tourist booths spaced out in Myeongdong, get lost just head to the tourist booths to get a map of the area. This is also a short walk to Lotte Shopping Centre."

284,3.0,Taken there by the hotel shuttle. Just your typical shopping fare. Crowded and all the interesting odors of food and clothing combined.
285,4.0,"I am not a shopping freak.. rather shopping actually freaks me out.. However, I must admit Myeongdong, provides a totally different experience. .. Myeongdong  means Bright town and the place actually stands by it.. It has a air of liveliness driven by some road side vendors along with some good mid range brands like ZARA, Mango etc.. A nice place to shop around for some distinct souvenirs, where tourist generally look out for.. as well as some regular use stuff like jackets, caps etc... Place is well equipped with plethora of restaurants and bars offering local as well as continental flavor.. I enjoyed my late evening strolls around the place during my visit. The liveliness of the place with nicely done decorations for just passed New year and upcoming Lunar (Chinese) New year added to the ambience.. I understand that it has been selected as a UNESCO heritage place and I would say  rightly so..."

288,5.0,"If you are a young girl or have a young daughter, this place is it for shopping. There are so many places to shop they have carts out on the streets selling clothes and gifts.  It is not for tourist things, although there are a few shops that sell the stuff, this place if for fashion and young people.Bring along a loved one and you will drop $500 before you leave for the day.  Moreover, that is just shopping for a few hours.My only complaint, the sizes run small and if you are a large girl, be prepared to be disappointed.  The shops rarely carry large sizes."

290,5.0,"This area is full of restaurants shops, street merchants.  Many of the stores provide musical entertainment on stages in the street.The energy of the many young people that frequent Myeondong (Mong dong) is contagious.

You will have a great experience for the cost of a subway ride!"
291,5.0,"Myeongdong was great! All the Korean cosmetics stores like Skin Food, Banila Co. Etude House etc were all beside each other. It was such a treat especially because they were having some promotions. International brands such as h&m and Zara were also there.
