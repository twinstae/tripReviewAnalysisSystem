0,4.0,"The campus has a really nice view on spring and autumn. Not only the students, everyone can come here to enjoy the scenery, take photos (even the pre wedding photos), or picnic with friends. The only disappointment is that there were too many people on spring and autumn so I couldnâ€™t enjoy the scenery."
1,4.0,"It's a great place to see tons of cherry blossom among many nice architecture buildings around the campus. You should come around early of April (may be early of 2nd week) to see the full bloom. PS. It's a university campus, so please keep quiet while walking around."
2,4.0,"Kyung Hee University is not a hot tourist spot but is known for its European style buildings and cherry blossoms. I went there in early April, 2017. Unfortunately the flowering time was some 2 weeks late due to cold weather. However I had a good time looking at the nice buildings and a chance to meet some students for photos. It is quite easy to go there. Just take Line 1 subway to station #123 (Hoegi) and there is a shuttle bus going directly to the University campus (4 stops). It was late afternoon so I had some nice pictures taken. Missed the cherry blossoms but the trip was worthwhile.  (Just not sure why the University is listed as a restaurant on Tripadvisor.)"
3,5.0,Amazingly beautiful university campus for all four seasons! Worth to visit this university although littlebit far from the center of Seoul.
