6,3.0,"The gate itself is beautiful and if you get a chance to walk along the walls up the hill you can really appreciate the scenery and get some great pics of the old/new with the gate vs city motif. At the same time, this gate is right in the heart of a busy intersection so it's harder to spend much time in front of the gate itself. Tip: there's a subway stop right here so it's easy access"
