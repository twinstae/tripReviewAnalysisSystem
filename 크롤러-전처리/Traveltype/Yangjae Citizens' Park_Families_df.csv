0,5.0,"Really nice park in southern Gangnam-gu District. it's huge and the forest is amazing. But, tourists don't need to come here because this is quite away from most touristic sites.- Many tall trees create shades and it's good to avoid heat in summer.- There are surrounding roads and wedding area inside. Children and camping tents, too. It's a bit disappointing not to feel peace in silence.- There is a little snack bar and things are highly priced.- It consists of two parts divided by the road. There's a metro station between them.- The lower part has some memorial structures and many costume play photoshoots.- This park is connected to the Yangjaecheon Stream Boardwalk and it's also good to take a walk."
