0,3.0,It‚Äôs you‚Äôre average mall. The library area was kind of cool.. until you realize that many of the ‚Äúbooks‚Äù are fake and attached to the shelves. Was even more of a bummer when I saw that the ‚Äúfake‚Äù books had duplicates all over the shelves.. They couldn‚Äôt even get unique fake books. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here‚Äôs a picture of me looking at a real book about behavioral economics written in Korean. That part was cool.
1,3.0,"I was expecting this mall to be bigger for shopping but it's not that big. I didn't visit the aquarium but I did to to the library which was unique and impressive. The shops weren't anything I haven't seen before in Seoul either. The food trucks at the front had long queues, maybe it would've been worth the wait since we entered up having mediocre expensive vietnamese food inside the mall."
2,5.0,"It is not just a Mall and a big shopping center with a huge food court but it also features an architecturally interesting library. With Free entrance, people could just walk in and read books which were just line up on the shelves. There were chairs and tables around the place. Many people were coming not to read books but to take photos of the place as it is very popular for tourists."
3,5.0,"This is a world class place with convention center, shops, aquarium, numerous restaurants and an airport check in for many airlines. You can spend hours here."
4,4.0,"The world's largest underground mall contains numerous retailers, as well as the huge Starfield Library. However, if you want to come out into the light of day, be sure to cross the street to explore the Bongeun-sa Buddist temple and enjoy the unique Hyundai Development Company headquarters, Tangent."
5,5.0,"Lots more to do than a typical mall, including a movie theatre, aquarium, library, and every type of food you can imagine."
6,4.0,"COEX mall is an upmarket underground shopping mall. Having been to several shopping malls before in Asia and Europe, the place did not excite us. We did not spend a lot of time here. The main reason we come across this place is because of the Gangnam style sculpture which is located at the eastern patio of this mall. It is a bronze sculpture of two fists/hands overlapping each other just like the fists motion of the gangnam style dance.We took a lot of pictures with the sculpture on the background."
7,3.0,"We came here to visit the library. A good mix of restaurants, fast food, food court, local and international brands. Love the Copenhagen flying tiger and Butter which offers creative and innovative home decor products."
8,4.0,"Located in the busiest territory of Gangnam district, this mall is huge and there is an enormous library/book store and an aquarium."
9,4.0,"Went to this mall because I wanted to take photos at the library. There are lots of shops here - pharmacies that sell beauty products, my favourite store Aland, Innisfree, bookstore, cafes, aquarium etc."
10,5.0,So if your in Seoul and in the Gangnam gu area this is a mall you should visit. These are my reasons:1. The mall has very different and unique shops available 2. Neva seen a Library inside a mall and it's so huge and the you won't be disturbed by the sound of the shoppers outside. There is soft music heard in the background.3. Had a LOTTE duty free inside (things are steap but if Ur brand conscious - not a bad decision to visit then)4. Fabulous Aquarium inside the mall. This Aquarium is HUGE. Even better than the Ripley's aquarium at TorontoThe food options is also good enough for all kinda traveller's.
11,5.0,This place carries a cheap dollar store as well as foreign and Korean brands. It has an area to get souvenirs. Picked up some great Korean shoes and clothes. I feel the prices are very comparable to the States but way better quality. The library is great to see.
12,5.0,A great place to eat and shop.  We stayed at a hotel connected to the COEX which made it very convenient/an adventure when we looked for different restaurants for our meals.  They have a really interesting library in the middle of the COEX.
13,4.0,Big underground shopping mall with lots of things to do.  A lot of restaurants to choose from.  There‚Äôs also a food court which we tried out.  The highlight was the library.  A must see!
14,4.0,We love going to COEX Mall and seeing it's ever-evolving range of clothing and food stores. The library is an amazing photo opportunity for the savy tourist. We found ourselves constantly walking in circles and getting confused direction simply because of the size of this place. It is a great mall to visit!
15,3.0,"Its really nothing special, and just a mall! The library in the middle is really lovely, but not worth a special visit. There are lots of places to eat, and western food available, but very busy due to lots of offices nearby. There is an aquarium inside, but lotte mall also has one, and I would recommend Lotte world mall over Coex (I have not been to either aquarium). Really nothing special, and not worth going our of your way for. But still a handy place to grab a coffee or a meal after visiting nearby Bongeunsa."
16,5.0,"Visit this shopping mall that has different shopping experience as also several well known Korean and international fashion  brands and home style shops .There are several restaurants and cafes in the mall not to forget a magnificent public library in the heart of the mall.It also houses banks .The mall opens 10.30 a.m. and closes at 10 p.m. Customers can visit by Line 2 at alight at Samseong Station Exit 5 & 6 and Bongeunsa Station Line 9 , Exit 7"
17,5.0,"This mall is the most interesting place, if you are planning to visit Korea in freezing day or scorcher. Simply said, this place provide everything in a just an area, shopping, sightseeing, theatre, eating, hotel, and even aquarium. it's really huge so please beware of using information centre or electronic map in the mall. Additionally, the mall is connected with Sam-sung station (in line 2), so the first-visitor will not be struggled with finding a mall."
18,3.0,"We only visited here for the Brick Live Lego shop. During our short visit, it seems the mall has events at their exhibition halls. In addition to restaurants, there were McD and other fast food joints. Mall is connected to the Seoul metro."
19,3.0,The library was amazing! But to be honest I was pretty disappointed by the shopping. We went out of our way to go here after reading so many reviews but didn't find anything special or exceptional shopping wise. Anything you can find here you can find and Lotte Department Store or any other shopping area. Worth a visit if you are close by.
20,3.0,We went there to see the huge library. It was on the ground floor in the COEX mall. It was ‚ÄúMUST SEE‚Äù spot. There were many people who actually use books. I wished if I could have read Hangul.
21,4.0,"This mall is nearby to gangnam gu  area. Its a huge underground shopping complex which is a part of much bigger coex convention centre. The famous coex aquarium is situated within this mall. This mall has many entrance gates. It remains open till 10 pm  (some of the shops start closing at 9:30 pm) after that only the restaurants remain open till 11. Many of the good restaurant s too close by 9:30 pm. So its better to visit this mall early in the evening. This mall houses many local as well as international brands. It is also a good place to buy some souvenirs though it will be a little costly. There are varieties of restaurants serving different cuisines of the world. One can get Korean, Japanese, European, Italian, American, Indian & Mediterranean restaurants there."
22,4.0,"best place to shop in one location - much better than meong-deong or dongdemun. Has some most major stores, an aquarium and a massive library/attrium. Foods, shops, cinema. Massive area."
23,2.0,"Yes, it is large, but the walking areas are very broad and the stores are big too, so there weren't as many shops as I expected. Overall I found it to be sterile and uninteresting. I had a much better shopping and people-watching experience at the Lotte World Tower and Mall place."
24,3.0,"So, this is a mall, and it has lots of large retailers. There's an aquarium (separate listing) and a cinema, and it is across the street from a temple, and has its own metro stop, but it's not really worth a visit if you are coming from somewhere that has average large retail stores."
25,5.0,"The beauty of this mall is the Information-- very good command of the English language. Helpful for travelers who are looking for things, or are lost. It offers the usual things a mall offers: good affordable restaurants, clothings stores, bookstores (with English books), etc. It's also connected/located to CoEx, to Oakwood Premier, to Hyundai Department Store, to Parnas, the CoEx Aquarium.Not sure until what time the place is open (or if it closes) but we did a quick run to McDonald's late at night and passed through here from Oakwood and back."
26,3.0,The mall is okay. Can be confusing. Was very tired afterwards. Couldn't do the aquarium as it didn't take our card and we didn't have enough Won on hand. Overall stores were experience compared to American stores but we new that going there. Restaurants were very diverse. Not the greatest mall I've been to.
27,3.0,"Coex is a great place to get your 10,000 steps in for the day.  Shopping is uninspiring.  No anchor stores.  There is no organization to the placement of the stores.  I would go there only if I've exhausted all the shopping options in Seoul."
28,4.0,"On one of the days we had in Seoul, my boyfriend and I decided to check out the CoEX mall because we saw cool pictures of it in a brochure. Of course, it is a very touristy spot that can get crowded at times with tourists, haha, but we spent more than 5 hours there! It's so big that my feet hurt from walking at the end of the visit but we were able to see the aquarium (very unique and ~21 USD), do a VR roller coaster ride, play arcade games, shop for 40 mins, eat ramen, check out their architecture, and eat the best green tea ice cream! Shops range from buyable for the average middle class person to luxury brands to souvenir shops to random trinkets! I suggest getting a map! Definitely enjoyed the visit minus the insane amount of obnoxious tourists but definitely fun if you like aquariums, shopping, people watching, arcades, movies, you name it. It's underground so perfect during hot or cold weather days."
29,5.0,"I am not a fun of shopping but the size of the mall is overwhelming. Located in center of gangham style,  it provides a lot of things to do.  Has an aquarium on the bottom floor and many famous brands to shop from.  It is pretty pricey but it is expected considering its location (gangnam). Would recommend to see it,  even if just for a quick stroll throughout the mall (still might take an hour)."
30,3.0,"This mall is nice if you're bored, have lots of money and if it's raining out. This mall used to be for the middle class but now it's just ridiculous. The majority of the new stores are so expensive, only rich people can afford to shop here."
31,5.0,"The mall is large and quite new.  Also includes a casino and Aquarium.  When we were there, not all stores were complete yet as it was still fairly new.  It also didn't seem too crowded."
32,3.0,"We came here in hope to visit kimchee museum on a rainy day. Unlike Myeongdong, this mall is full of local people! It is pleasant and a lot less crowded. However, we were a little disappointed that kimchee museum is closed."
33,3.0,"When we visited this mall I kept wondering: maybe it's just because I am an American. We walked and walked and walked and we never found really much of anything. It was very strange. And then we would find ourselves in a giant, empty convention-hall lobby? All malls in Korea are not like this: we found several other malls to be sensibly laid-out and easy to navigate. Not so at the COEX Mall."
34,2.0,"Very frustrating the way that it has been built it is quite a mess really. shops are everywhere you get lost and so spaced out , not much shops to buy from eventhough its huge took us so long from myeongdong to gangnam by taxi so much traffic and was a waste of time, not worth the visit"
35,3.0,"I read that this was one of the largest underground malls in the world and the largest one in Asia I believe, so I had to come here. This place indeed is very big with an assortment of shops (and a random small aquarium as well!), but it's easily passable if you're tourist as there isn't anything really remarkable/memorable about it. They have an alright food court though."
36,3.0,"This mall is huge and mostly under ground, but it's basically just a regular shopping mall, only easier to get lost in. Worth visiting if it's raining outside or if you're looking for something specific. Not really an attraction in itself, though."
37,4.0,"I'm not usually one for crazy shopping trips while travelling, but we made Coex Mall a destination when we found out about the Gundam Base retail store cuz we're nerdy like that.So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily. We did this early on in our trip to Korea so it was a nice introduction to Korean mall culture and the local style, I guess."
38,5.0,"Get off at the Samseong Station and COEX is right there. We stayed here all day walking around as it is connected to the Intercon, Oakwood Hotels, as well as the Hyundai Department Store. Lots of pricey brands and outlets, and a selection of fast food options. There is also an aquarium although we did not bother to go inside. Perfect for a rainy day or blistery weather outside."
39,3.0,"It was a huge mall with luxury boutiques. Many food outlets to choose. If you are thinking to buy something economical, you can forget about going there....I would suggest going to Myeongdong and Dongdaemun area better."
40,5.0,We loved this place! All restaurants and coffees were very good. And it was connected to a department store too. Especially coffees at Kona Queens - not sure the name were very lovely. We will visit again sometime soon.
41,4.0,"Coex Mall houses quite a lot of shops. It is connected to the Hyundai Department Store. In the mall is also a casino. Did not check it out so won't be able to comment. More importantly, it is connected to the City Airport where you can check in your flights and baggages in advance. To get there, take the metro to Samseong Station and exit at exit 5 or 6."
42,3.0,"The mall itself seemed very average to me. Yes, there are a lot of stores, most aren't high end, and most aren't low end, just somewhere in between. The lay out of the mall is very maze like. At times I wasn't sure where I was going. But, somehow the mall connected into the Hyundai Department Store. Since this is located in Gangnam, the first two floors are dedicated to luxury shopping. And I do mean ""high end"". This Hyundai Department Store is the best in Seoul! And they have a food court on the lower level. Is the mall still worth going to..........it sure is. There are lots of other things to do there. Shopping, Casino, Aquarium, lots of restaurants, and a Cinema. You could spend the whole day here. Strictly Shopping -  2 StarsBesides Shopping - 4 StarsHyundai Department Store - 5 Stars"
43,5.0,Wow biggest mall I have been in . There is a aquarium inside a cinema and heaps of shops . You can get lost but there is everything and every brand you can think of .
44,5.0,"So while the others in our group rather circled in the part of the city on the left coast of river Han, we ( my wife and I ) decided to go across the river and visit some interesting sites in, I may say, more modern region of so dense populated metropole, as it is Seoul. To get on the right coast of the river Han, we had taken a subway tram, whose line is not put deep beneath the ground level, that is, we had a ride with so called ""light metro"".We crossed the Dongbu Bridge and in Gangnam-gu region got to the very exciting place, called Coex Mall.That is an underground big shopping mall. There are here many conventions centers, exhibitions halls, many malls with plenty of shops.Then, passing by these attractive shops, we got to the food courts with traditional korean food. Along with such pleasant stores, we found also the couple of movie theatres, COEX Aquarium, a large book store and even one Museum.You can use the Seoul Metro Line 2, to arrive there. Not so far from the Coex Mall is located Samsoeng Complex, that is very worth to be seen."
45,4.0,huge mall with a wide variety of shops. Good restaurants but quiet expensive. its quiet far from the city but convinient from the subway. The duty free shop there was quiet off putting.
46,4.0,Not a big fan of mall (more my wifes thing) but still pretty fascinating.  Would be especially good if you had small feet and needed shoes....
47,4.0,"The COEX mall is under the COEX exhibition hall. It also comes with an aquarium but I did not visit that area. The entrance is conveniently located near the Samseong metro exit. Some days they have musicians performing in the mall. A lot of American Branded stores can be found here such as Levis, Nike, Adidas etc. The prices are a little higher than US MSRP, so if you're looking for a deal, this is not the best place to get it."
48,2.0,"Part of the mall is still under renovation, hence there isn't much to shop here. No doubt it is huge, very spacious, but wait till it is fully renovated. Most brands in this mall can be found at other huge shopping malls or departmental stores."
49,2.0,This place was so talked up in all the guide books and online but it's really just a very spaced out mall. All of the shops you can see anywhere else in the world and that makes it pretty much like any other mall.
50,3.0,"The mall is located near the Samseong Metro station.This mall failed to impress us for numerous reasons.First of all, it's completely underground and feels totally claustrophobic.Secondly, it's incomplete and large parts of it are still being built.But most importantly - we visited the mall during the summer and parts of it (especially the parts still being built and renovated) were not air-conditioned. This resulted in unbearable temperatures inside the mall and the lack of ventilation plus the mass of people there made the entire experience uncomfortable, to say the least.While there are a lot of eateries around the malls, an aquarium, many shops, cinemas and pharmacies, we still could not escape but feel its gloomy atmosphere."
51,3.0,I don't know if part of the mall was closed or something since it seemed very small and there were not that many stores. In addition the stores were uninteresting so we just walked through the whole place and did not do any shopping.
52,4.0,"This mall includes numerous shops, four food courts ( mostly Korean food ), the excellent, high end Hyundai Department Store, a multiplex cinema, exhibition halls  and an aquarium. We stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel here so, often went walking in the Mall and had a quick lunch in the food hall or Hyundai Department Store."
53,3.0,"It is a very large and imposing underground shopping mall that shares the same facility as an exhibition hall. There were many shopsfront but many were closed, not opened or boarded up. The other mainly sold more of skincare brands and some accessories. I was looking for clothes/ fashion outlets but there were not much at the point in time.It is rather disappointing, and the price here was not too good either. As least not when comparing to Myeodeong or the Women's University. A pity as well, since this place is huge and rather new and clean, so it would have made for a good shopping paradise.For more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/kaptivating-korea.html"
54,2.0,"I visited the COEX mall after reading great reviews.  Unfortunately there are major renovations happening until early 2014, and as a result there is not a lot to do.  There are still some shops open, as well as the acquarium and cinemas, but there are better shopping areas available in Seoul.  I think this will all be rectified when the renovations are complete"
