We visited several times during our stay, during which we tried one of the night time river cruises, had a picnic another day, and came for a night walk the last one (so many great food trucks here!). You can take the metro to Yeouido."
1,5.0,"Hangang park is one of the most popular park in Seoul and it is one of the must visit in the time of cherry blossom. Normally it will be very crowded during Spring season but on the day that my friends and I visited this place there is not very much people because due to the weather that was raining.Hangang park is a perfect place for those who would like to do an outdoor leisure recreation activities and those who would like to escape busy city life but don’t have very much time.  It is a very nice place to spend time with your family, friends, or love one. This place is definitely worth your while to make a trip here because it has so much to offer and one of the most popular activities that when people come here like to do is picnic, you can bring your own food or if you want to feel a little bit local you can ordering fried chicken and beer and get it delivering directly to you which is very convenient  and popular here but the activity that my friends and I did was riding a bicycle which is also very popular, there are many rental bicycle service that you can rent which will cost you about 6,000 KRW for 1 hour which we thought was  a reasonable price because you can ride along the river where you will totally have a  great moment here. It is also a very nice place to just sit down relax and chilling.For those who would like to come I highly recommended you to take a metro to Yeonaru which is the closest station but if you want to enjoy the scenery view you can also take a metro to Yeouido station and walk from the station through  Yeouido park. Please check the weather before coming to the park because if it is too cold it will be very empty and quiet and rental bicycle service might not be open."
2,4.0,Lovely to walk by this river. Lots of seating area. Good playground areas for kids. Good picnic area. Can get 1 hr ferry here. I think it was about $35.Negative: all the loose dirt/ grass that was being blown about.
3,5.0,"So in Korea when you picnic, it involves a tent, mat and small table!!! So much fun. The Han is obviously important to Seoul as it cuts the city in two. We spent the day eating, cycling, playing cards, taking photos and then going for a cruise. Plenty of parking and easy to get to. An excellent way to spend the day, even in the middle of winter."
4,4.0,A nice park to walk around or just sit for a few hours and relax. I went there with a few friends and they ordered some Fried Chicken which I was told is a pretty common thing to do in this area. A very peaceful place and a beautiful view of the river.
5,5.0,hankang river is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable places you can visit once you come to Korea cheers
6,5.0,"Going to the Hangng park. Hangang is one of the most famous river in the Korea, because around the Hangang there are lots of people who is hang out outside. Around the Hangang there are lots of activities such as riding bicycle, and riding electric kick board. also during the summer when the night's come the people come out and they enjoy their night. eat chicken and beer, because this culture is very famous in Korea. also sometimes there are people who is doing small concert so people can watch it freely and enjoy it. at night Hangang is very cool because of the river water"
7,3.0,It is a pity that it was raining when we visited but it was still lovely to stroll along the edge of the lake and enjoy the lake's beauty even so.
8,5.0,"Hanging Park is on the very top of my favourite place in Seoul. You can go on picnic with family, friends, or boyfriend or girlfriend. Blue sky, fresh air, soft wind, delicious food, and nice people would make you feel happy. I really really highly recommend you to go to Hanging park on any season if you would visit South Korea."
9,5.0,Han River is very big. But there are many attractions beside it. You just have to do some research in order for you to know what side of Han River you should be going.
10,4.0,Awesome experience!!! There are a few places off to the side if you want to be alone or with a small group... but also plenty of other places to be around people and food trucks that are amazing.
11,4.0,If you are going to visit Seoul be sure to visit Hangang as  it is a good tradition. You can see how Koreans have good time after work with friends and family. And of course you should order Korean fried chicken. Upon arrival you would meet a lot of ajhummas with brochures and lot of different set options. The chicken will arrive approximately in 15 mins and you can enjoy it together with Hangang view as all other Koreans there feel the atmosphere
12,5.0,"The best free day out in Seoul. Beautiful at night too. You can order a picnic to be delivered to you if you can speak Korean. If you can't, ask a local to help you call and order. You can also rent picnic blankets."
13,4.0,"I ride bmx bike. It was fun rode with my own bike with local riders. It was winter when i get there, as south east asian i feel freezing. The local said that hangang park is coldest in seoul,because it outdoor place and there are no building over there. When you come to hangang park and winter season,please get some soju or odeng for warming your body"
14,3.0,"Not sure if it's every Saturday, but there's fireworks when we went the last March 24. A lot of teens are also setting up their tents on the park.We can still feel the chilling wind of winter but we got hot packs ready ^,^.hahaha. If you're into chicken and beer, there's stalls available where you can buy and eat on the benches overlooking the river. Just make sure to clean as you go.(gmrc will save you a lot of trouble=)), Since we went there at night, we didn't see much attraction other than the fireworks and the I SEOUL U letters.City lights are quite far.. Maybe we'll visit there at daytime on our next trip."
15,5.0,"If you go to Seoul, then you should definitely pass by here. You’ll get a great view of the city. Don’t forget to take something for a possible picnic mood. Also, you can stroll around the place while waiting for the Banpo Rainbow show. You’ll have to check the date and time for this. Recommended."
16,4.0,"The view was great and there were a lot of cherry blossoms when we went. It was a bit crowded because there were a lot of campers. If not for the cold, I would have strolled around this place."
17,5.0,We found Hangang Park while searching for SM building. The environment is quite nice and peaceful since we went there at 10 am. We saw many Koreans cycling along the park. The public toilets are clean too.
18,5.0,"Walked there, played basketball, chilled, drunk etc... It is just nice place for any type of hanging out or chilling:) my personal recommendation to Seoul visitors!"
19,4.0,"Very nice park with possibilities of eating, resting, walking, biking. Better to visit on a warm day. Possible to have a river boat trip."
20,4.0,"There was a fair along the Hangang at some specific time of the year. Different kinds of stalls would be temporarily set up there to sell all kinds of goods, from food to accessaries. Definitely worth a visit if you're around in those dates!"
21,4.0,지하도를 지나기 약간 그랬지만 걷기 좋고 야경도 멋진 장소였어요. 잠원지구로 갔었고 대교까지 걸어서 갔다가 청담동 쪽으로 빠졌어요. 여름에 오면 좋을 장소입니다.It's good place for walking. A bit scared of subway. But will be great in summer time
22,5.0,"Great recreational area!  If you’re going there for the light show, it’s suggested to go there a couple hours earlier to get good sitting.Not a big fan of the chicken delivery service as it took really long for us.  But you could order food there with the different delivery guys.It’s also great visiting there in the daytime.  The park is huge so you will not get bored."
23,5.0,"We went there on a Saturday night, and the place was just alive with crowds of friends and families spreading out their mats just about everywhere and talking and laughing. There were buskers every few meters to add to the fun atmosphere and old ladies handing out flyers for local delivery shops. We ordered chicken and bought beer and found ourselves a spot. There are public bathrooms nearby, carts that sell mats and some snacks for those who didn't bring any, and convenience stores if you run low on drinks. It was just so fun. You can rent bikes too."
24,5.0,Great place to stroll around in the evening totally fell in love with this place. We went on the river cruise and rent bicycle to move around the park it so was fun and there are plenty of activities for friends and family.
25,5.0,"We were at Banpo Hangang,  Lovely place to spend the evening with ramen and fried chicken :) Especially lively on weekend. Across Banpo Hangang, the new ""round"" building is open with cool cafes and outfoor sitting where you can just hang and read a book.  Great Place : )"
26,5.0,Perfect for sunny days relax! Lot of arractions and places for whole families. Would love to come back :)
27,5.0,"Its one of the best park i must say, its clean and very cold specially at night. Alot of activities to do but if you feel to relax and makes you feel your in Korea you must go here. Just bring your snacks while resting here ."
28,5.0,"This is an amazing park along the river. There is so much you can do here. Can really recommend to hire a bike or tandem bike for 2-3 hours. You can also walk and just enjoy what comes in your way. There is a waterpark for children and also some ""rivers"" floating through the park were you can dip your feet."
29,5.0,We came here by subway and it's so easy with that. We went there on Friday evening so there was so many truck food. With the live band playing. We enjoy that very much! And if you are have free time can rent the bike and ride around the park!There also local family lying down on the garden with tent! This is so cool experience!
30,5.0,"It's a big park, and perfect for a nice cycle along the river at sunset! Lots of amenities as well. Really recommended!"
31,5.0,"Hangang Park is huge.  It's great for exercising, riding your bike along the river, having a picnic...On a nice day, it can get pretty crowded, but that's to be expected in Seoul."
32,5.0,"The park on the side of Ttukseom Resort Station was really good fun. Enjoyed the skateboard park twice during my trip, many ramps and large skatable area to practise. There is also convenient bicycle rental and many convenience stores along the way to get food and drinks. There is a public pool there too but it was not open yet."
33,5.0,A great park with many different things to see and do.I recommended hiring out a bike and riding alongside the river. Ask at the desk for a good route. You will need to hand over your passport as a deposit and the cost is very cheap.Good for a day out and the whole family will enjoy this.After you have finished coincide this with a visit to the world cup stadium.
34,5.0,This park is so suitable for all ages and I should have your picnic there. It was exciting to be there!
35,4.0,The weather was really nice when I visited this wonderful park. Very cool place for couples and tourist to visit. I visited this place with my friends but still enjoyed it. I wish my boyfriend came along haha. A must go for a tourist to click some amazing photos.
36,5.0,"My friend in Korea bring me there, we have bike for 2 hours, walk for a while,  we even ordered take away chicken and eat , we enjoyed a whole afternoon there"
37,4.0,"It was freezing for us in February but it was a nice walk along the Han river.  If you are specifically looking for the I Seoul U sign, it is still there! Line 5, exit Yeouinaru subway station and head out exit 2 or 3. Warmer weather will bring out the food vendors and people hanging out on the grass and steps. Will revisit in warmer weather."
38,4.0,"We have a short visit only at this place, but i think this is a nice place to visit with friends just to enjoy the moment."
39,5.0,This area at night looks always beautiful. Came around here for New Years and it was very nice. Some local food around to eat
40,4.0,"I used to visit the Han River with my family all the time when I was young. It has always been part of my life until I stopped going as an adult. Last spring, I was visiting Seoul and decided to walk along the river to see cherry blossoms and it brought back so many memories! It is a cool place to hang out with friends and family for a picnic and fly kites. You'll see a lot of family bringing their kids to just hang out and play sport or games. You can literally come here anytime of the day to chill. Just make sure you are warm during the winter because it can get very windy during the winter. Ride the ferry if you have extra time..."
41,5.0,"If you still have some spare time before you go back to your home country, try going here for some relax. You can jog, walk, riding bicycles, picnic, have fun drink beer at night, take pictures and just sitting and relax. The best time to go there is at night where you can sit and be overwhelmed by the view while drinking beer or sodas and order some chicken to eat. Going alone or with friends is your preference."
42,4.0,"There are several exits to the Han river, near one of the exits to the park is the I Seoul U sign. At evening there are lights and people come here for a picnic."
43,5.0,"I think it's caused by we didnt came on the peak seasons so it's not crowded at all. Really a good experience for us to feel the peace & busy of Seoul together. When sitting down near to the bridge, you can feel the busy of Seoul through the sound of cars driving by and the lights of buildings but you can find yourself in peace at the same time. We spent 2 hours here & doing nothings than sat down & listen to the sounds of ""present""."
44,4.0,"This is where you get to take photos with the ISeoulU sign (similar to I Amsterdam sign). If you take the train, go to the  Yeoinaru station, it is 5 min walk from the exit"
45,5.0,"Hangang Park is the ideal place if you want to be away from the shopping streets of Myeongdong/Dongdaemun etc. The views of Seoul City are just amazing. You can also take great photographs. The Hangang river is huge so you can alight at several stations to enjoy different views of the river (Exit 2 or 3 of Ttukseom Resort station (Seoul Subway Line 7, Exit 1 of Cheonho station (Seoul Subway Line 5 & 8) or Exit 2 or 3 of Yeouinaru station (Seoul Subway Line 5))"
46,5.0,"Nice, peaceful park near the river bank. good for walking and exercising. view of the city is very nice too."
47,5.0,"It is a lovely place to view the scenery. walking and looking to the surrounding. suitable for couples, family and friends."
48,4.0,the river is a place where Koreans are visiting to have a picnic during sunny days. its a rather large area where you can just sit down and enjoy life. Also several river cruises that are leaving from this area.
49,5.0,"This place is without a doubt the best place to experience Seoul on a weekend like a local.  Ride a bike for hire (cheap),  order fried chicken to your picnic on the grassy areas.  Thirsty?  No problem.  Get food and drinks from the nearby convenience stores in the park. Also this is the place where the famous han river cycling route is. There are several water sports,  although nothing terribly must do.  This place is fantastic to chill with friends, picnic and bike location."
50,5.0,"There are street performers on weekend nights, making it a perfect place to chill. You will also get to enjoy Hangang Park to the fullest as there will be loads of young adults hanging out here but not to the point where it is too crowded. There are also food trucks available. Definitely a good place to relax and chill."
51,5.0,"this place is really amazing ,you can take a pictures near the river or take a boot for river tour , in this location fresh air and a lot of Activities dance , some bands and some place for sale a food and goods , at night especially in the week end the park full with the people ,really don't miss this place if you want to visit Seoul"
52,5.0,"Walk around, see the river, maybe take a boat tour - it's so nice on a sunny day! do note that there aren't a lot of places to eat nearby, so get your own or try going into the small streets."
53,5.0,"I visit here a couple times a year with family/ friends from  out of town but I hadn't been in a couple of years. Wow! The money that's been poured in here! There are actually five separate parks under the umbrella of Hangang Park, but they have all had a massive revamp in facilities and pathways etc. Especially notable to be here at sunset at it sets along the length of the river and is very picturesque."
54,3.0,"Strolling along the Hangang Park is only recommended as a precursor to the Han River Cruise; however, if you don't have time to spare, missing out on this attraction would be fine. The park provides a scenic view of Seoul's city skyline; however, on our date of visit, the skies were quite hazy. I'd still pick HK's Victoria Harbour over this."
55,4.0,"Don't just look into Hangang Park from the highway, cause it has a lot for you to explore. You can just visit Hangang Park at day and go biking around it or you can also visit it at night cause it has colorful light and bridge attraction everynight."
56,5.0,"This review is about cycling. There are many things to do on the waterfront... dance, have a meal or picnic, walking, etc., but it is the bicycle paths that make this such an enjoyable place to visit. The country is strewn with well cared for paths. The main one in Seoul is here at the Hangang. There are plenty of places for refueling yourself and for caring for your bike. The coffee shops and convenience stores are often the scene of cyclists in their matching gear and colorful sticker-speckled helmets.This park is so popular, though, as a cyclists be careful! The pedestrians tend to spill off the walking path and onto the cycling path."
57,4.0,"Yeouido Hangang Park is the place to be if you enjoy street food, beautiful river view and street performances, bring a picnic mat or tent on a good weather day to relax and unwind.Just a couple minutes walk from the train station, the entrance of this park is filled with street food vendors and fried chicken delivery people. Take your pick. After getting food, head towards the river and you'll spot many street performances, especially on weekends, some are really good. The river view is also beautiful and you can cycle in the area too. If the sky is clear, the sunset view is also very memorable."
58,4.0,"Took the river cruise, worth the trip, though the trip was a little short. Beautiful place you would not want to miss when in Seoul! Gotta catch sunset here too."
59,3.0,"Seoul is sprawling with parks, and this one doesn't offer much -- it's good to visit if you're staying near the area but other the usual fare of biking, and having a picnic, there's not much."
60,5.0,"if, by any chance, there is any of you who is like madly in love with korean drama (like me) then u must know when sometimes they're just hanging around Hangang Park while eating spicy fried chicken with soju or makgeolli? well, that is exactly what im doing when i went here..turns out, its quite fun and i really had a good time.so why dont you try?"
61,5.0,"Pretty much sums it all up with my title. Cycle along the river, enjoy the breeze, take in the sights and sounds, join in the laughters."
62,5.0,"We have lived nearby the river park for three years, and value every kilometer -- what a great vision!  At all hours, people are walking or riding or skating along the river walk.  It is so encouraging to walk or ride there, even if only for a few minutes.  And there are convenience stores every few kilometers!  I wonder why there are no official sit-down restaurants along the water's edge."
63,5.0,Nice walk with great view.  Very conveniently located and could start or end almost any time.  Bike ride is also nice.
64,5.0,"It is really easy to get to this park on the river using Purple subway line 5 - getting off at Yeouinaru - go out Exit 2 - you are there!  Must see how Koreans flock to the park. We went early evening and it was a blast.  If you want to the left, under the bridge - keep going til you get to the fountain area, you can rent bikes to ride the trails. So much fun. You can also have a picnic there - we had chicken delivered - you can pretty much have anything delivered to you at the park to eat, but I would not recommend that unless you have a Korean with you to make the call and explain where you are located in the park. There is a convenience store to buy drinks - vendors - and you can even buy or rent these shiny square pads to sit down on the ground for a picnic from the vendors. It was great - one of the best activities we did in Seoul - and you can really see how Koreans relax, as there are not many tourists going to picnic on the river."
65,5.0,"This is amazing for those who want to have an exercise for free! My friend and I really enjoyed the experience here even for a while. So many sports equipment found there. When you see Yeouido Full Gospel Church, cross the road and go down. There's this long line of cars alongside the park."
66,4.0,"If you have enough time apart from vising touristic places, bring a mat/blanket and come here for a picnic with your beloved ones. If it's sunny and warm, you can even soak up the sun here. It's also good spot to ride a bike or run. Don't worry about food. You can order food by a phone call like locals and it will be delivered to you. If your korean is not good enough to make a phone call or you're not with someone who can speak korean, simply use convinient stores or restaurants there."
67,5.0,"Yet another attraction seen on Korean dramas and if you have extra time, do arrange for a picnic with your friends/family which is common for the locals.✌😉"
68,4.0,"Quality time from the hustle and bustle city life with family and friends, whether a picnic or a river cruise, or be surprised by the many organised events esp on the weekends... this is the place to be... well maintained and safe with public ammenities such as toilets along the river bank, you'll also appreciate the occasional Internet accessibility. In 2011, Hangang was voted the 2nd most scenic location in Seoul... so that's a little something you'll have to find out ... cheers!"
69,5.0,"It is by far my favorite places. If you want to enjoy some time away from the crowd and noise, that place is perfect for that and quite close still. There , you can rent bike, Rollerblade, skateboard, badminton rackets ... you can even exercise for free as there are an outside gym equipements , or just have some picnic. It is usually very clean and well maintained and so huge that there is enough space for everyone ( seriously enormous ) . It is really great to take photos."
70,5.0,"Hangang park is huge! Great nature scenes with wide bicycle path, perfect spot for biking. Go around the park and you'll notice great architectures too, like this spiral bridge."
71,4.0,I walked from the World cup park to the Yeouido park.It was gray weather and I feel some stuffy.But other things like the sight and the facilities are perfect!
72,4.0,A place to relax and chill at with good atmosphere. Suitable for having finger food and beer there with a couple of friends to hang about.
73,5.0,Despite it being a drizzly day we still enjoy strolling around the park and taking in the sights along the river as well as the beauty of the cherry blossoms.  There is so much activity going on and must be especially wonderful on a sunny day.
74,3.0,Do rent a bike to stroll along the riverside to enjoy the scenic view of Hangang River. It could be nice if you have enough time to come back for fireworks from one of it bridge
75,5.0,"I went to this place with my friend last summer. They have bike rental which is very good for people to just relax and do some sports. I went back again during last autumn and it was chilly. When I first came here, I was so happy because you can't really find a decent park in Korea. They do have, but not as I expected. I highly recommend this to someone who loves picnic, some me-time, cycling... Enjoy!"
76,3.0,Went there to learn rollerblade. There are rollerblades and bicycles for rent. Also popular among locals to have a picnic. Main spot of fireworks festival every year.
77,5.0,"One of my favorite things to do in Seoul is to have a picnic at one of the Han River Parks. Two of my favorite ones are Yeoido and Banpo Han River park. Spring and Fall are the best times to visit cause of the warm weather. Bring a mat (although you could buy one at the park) get some beer at the convenience store and order chicken (there are many people passing out flyers) to be delivered to your spot. You can ride a bike (there are many rental spots), take a nice stroll along the river, play basketball, play lawn sports (Frisbee, badminton, catch), exercise with the equipment or just eat and nap under the sun and cool breeze. There is usually bus and subway access to the major Han River park spots. Seriously one of the best things to do in Seoul."
78,5.0,"I came here during spring (nearly summer) and it's just the best time to visit here because the weather is just soooo warm~ I came to Yeouido Park and it's really accessible from subway station. Once you arrived, you could rent a bike with cheap fee and it would really help you since you dont need to walk far to the Han Gang riverside. The riverside view is just amazzzzinggly breathtaking! No wonder many dramas used this location for shooting. The park is clean and many families came here to swim in the pools near the river. Durinh spring, there are many beautiful flowers and no one bother to ruin these flowers❤️ as expected from Korea."
79,5.0,"Excellent network of bicycling trails, but watch out for inattentive riders (who often seem to wear earbuds).  This park stretches the length of the Han River in Seoul.  If coming for a short visit, stop by the park near Yeouinaru Subway Station or near Mapo Bridge.  These are great areas to fly a kite on a windy day.  There are convenience stores up and down the river path, so one is never far from a snack."
80,4.0,"Hangang park runs along Seoul's Han River. The river that seperates the older from the newer side of the city. The Park was revamped a few years ago and the end result is exactly what a crowded city needed. A place to jog, bike, roller blade, play basketball, fly kites or just relax. The best part is that there's always cheap parking and plenty of space to cut loose. Thata because the park pretty much runs along a good stretch of the river so its huge."
81,3.0,"The parking the Han river banks offers a really nice view on Seoul's skyline and the many bridges across the wide river. You can walk around the whole island of Yeong. Maybe because it is October, the park appears to be a bit run down and not well kept. Quite a lot of waste was on the lawn and the walkways."
82,5.0,"Nice place for jogging/biking. Very peaceful if you are looking for some private time. It's good to see many locals getting together and meeting after sunset. Cheers,"
83,4.0,"We love that the whole atmosphere was very chillax and enjoyable, particularly in the evening/night. Many people cycle/jog/walk their dogs/picnic there. If you want to have a korean experience, may I suggest to buy friend chicken & beer to enjoy by the Hangang?"
84,4.0,"The highlight of the park is the rainbow musical performance which only played at 3 timings at night. My gal pal and I didn't take the boat to cruise the river. We had taken the train and walk a fair bit of distance to reach the destination. Although the temperature then was 14degree Celsius, we didn't notice the chill. The music and water performance were mesmerising. It was one of the highlights of the trip in Seoul. :)"
85,5.0,"Walk from the Lotte World Shopping Mall in a straight line to the Han River and find yourself transported in a different world, away from the hubbub and along a surprisingly quiet river mid afternoon. There are earmarked areas for exercising and for resting along the river as well as paths for joggers and cyclists. Beware of the massive pelotons you may see now and again (we counted well over 120!). Here you can see wildlife (fish of course, egrets, wild flowers) and admire the symmetry of bridges from below or the reflection of the underground bridge in the water.These are not manicured gardens, this is countryside in the middle of a city."
86,2.0,"Standard river stroll. Although quieter than the city, the air pollution from the adjoining Highway makes strolling along this path unenjoyable. There was a free musical performance on Sunday."
87,4.0,Great place for different activities1 From swimming camping jogging relaxing walking and of course biking
88,5.0,Love the park and was lucky to have caught the cherry blossoms.Will pop by next time with the kids of a picnic
89,4.0,"For those expecting this place to be lively during normal days, you are definitely going to be disappointed but this place is where most Koreans have their daily exercise or yearly marathon but if you are looking to have a slow walk with your love ones or just to chill with your family while enjoying the breeze, this place is just right. You will see old couple having slow walks but if you are lucky enough to be at the right location of the Hangang park (Yes, the river is very long) you might encounter celebrities jogging. Although you may enjoy the boat rides across the river by paying a few thousand won."
90,3.0,"Coming from a city with some of the most diverse architecture in the world, the views of Seoul at Hangang Park can seem almost dystopian, but in an odd way that lends something to the experience. The park is a great place to relax at the riverside or take a cruise down the Han."
91,3.0,"I tend to remove the romanticism attached to this park and the surrounding area from it, because it is actually rather bland and mostly meant for a day out with family or friends during summer and spring. In the cold fall and winter, you can consider going here, but the biting wind will mean that you cannot stay for long under the draft, and will be likely to catch a cold. During the cherry blossom festival in Seoul though, you will be likely to catch the sight of the cherry blossoms, along with many other tourists from within the country and foreign tourists too."
92,4.0,There are paths for pedestrian and cyclist/skaters along the river. You can enjoy the view and play sports like basketball at the courts. Great place to relax and workout. The place is nicely revamped with wooden walkways at some areas.
93,5.0,"This is one of the best areas of Seoul, Korea. I walked there for 3-4 hours with my friend. Very well-decorated , neat-clean though crowded. It is a great place for camping and picnic. There is a rainbow-fountain bridge that works in evening to night at a 30 minutes interval"
94,3.0,"Hangang park is fine for a weeknight stroll, but for the true nature lover it's just another city park. The breeze off the river is lovely in the hotter months, but if you're only in Korea for a short stay, try to get to one of the stunning national parks in the area. Otherwise, good for running/walking in the evenings and early mornings when it's less busy."
95,5.0,"We had great time in Hangang Park. I personally enjoyed the cool breeze and smell of fresh air and the running water which allows visitors to dip their feet. Unfortunately we visited the park hours before our flight. I wish we had visited it earlier. In the park you can also enjoy biking , which we were not able to do due to time constraints. But over all it's a good view of Han River as well."

98,4.0,"The park is nice and spacious. It is a great place for a picnic or beers with friends (there is a convenience shop if you want to buy stuff there). However, if you'd like to find a shady spot under a tree, look out for many bugs and pooping birds. They really got me!"

103,5.0,"I'm glad I came here on the last day of my visit to Seoul.Many days at tourist area, shopping area and city, the first place I experience Korean with their leisure life - couple sitting side by side chatting, lone person sitting by the river looking at the view, youngsters in group having fun, family picnic, etc. A place where some Korean drama and program took place but I can only recognize some."
104,5.0,"I was here for the Fireworks Festival and it was amazing! Although it got super chilly towards late evening, my friends and I got a superb view of the fireworks and met an incredible bunch of locals who were kind enough to share their mats, blankets and food with us. While waiting for the fireworks to officially commence, we had a splendid time chatting with the people around us. A day well spent at the park! On another occasion, we decided to have a fried chicken party at the park in the late evening. We ordered and waited for our fried chicken delivery off the road (literally) and devoured the yummy spread near the river. There's so much to do at the park! Find a nice and comfortable spot and you could easily spend a couple of hours behind a book or simply people watch."
105,4.0,"I like kdramas... Hangang park is one of the most places they used to picture korean people's life, a place to relieve stress... Well it's right indeed... I went to the park near jamsil area.. It was very comfortable to just walking around... At night, u can enjoy the citylights... Some people even still jogging and cycling at the park.. Few restaurants were there too to have dinner or just have coffee and snacks while enjoying the fresh air and view... For those who wants a calm place in the middle of seoul, i recommend this place.."
106,4.0,The visit to the place is a must if you are looking for a place that can be a bit far from all the hustle and bustle with a serene air and views. The park basically overlooks the Han River and is good for a quick stroll and even picnics. I though loved the place for being able to rest and a have a peaceful time from all the city exploration.
107,5.0,"This place is SO great. I can't even begin..So me and my friends went here during sunset. We saw a lot of groups and couples. They were out on picnics and dates. We keep hearing songs and music. People were singing, chatting and drinking. You know, being merry.♧ We just decided to lounge around and take it all in. It was a bit late for a bike ride.I returned 3 days later at 7 am. The bike stand was not yet open so I decided to get  meatball soup and ooyoo at a nearby convenience store. Bike ride was amazing, one of the best I've been. It was a gorgeous day in mid May, the sun was out, the morning wind was still crisp and a little chilly and, the best part of all, the flowers were blooming. I remember seeing roses on the wall and daisies and lavenders and thank god I went a the right moment. There were tons of lovely parks and bridges and areas along the way. I loved going under the bridges on this trail. They were big and gorgeous and so is the river. Go to Hangang!!! ♡ This place is a must. It's great for both solo and group trips!! ☆☆☆☆☆"

109,3.0,"we went for a stroll at night looking for the cafes that were recommended online. Not only we couldn't find the cafes, we had to walk almost an hour in the drizzle before we reached some cafes. The paths were not very lighted up and there was nothing much to see and do if one goes at night."

Perfect place for u is here.Park around Han river is really peaceful and nice place to working out or just chatting with others.And there is a popular water skiing shop so if you like water leisure, stop by there and enjoy yourself.Water skiing is $15 per each( just 1time).A little bit expensive cause it's around 15minutes per time but really exciting.Anyway everything is awesome here.Come and have fun."
114,5.0,"I live near the stretch of Hangang Park so I come here pretty often.It is a comfortable place for you to enjoy a stroll or if you come in the morning/afternoon, you can rent a bicycle at 3,000won.At night, it is more lively as a picnic area with a lot of koreans eating chicken and camping here. Lawn is pretty clean as everyone is laying around it.To be cautious : There are a lot of mosquitoes especially around Summer."
115,4.0,"Braved the cold wind and made it here with my friend. Lovely Hangang River view, you get the feeling when couples meet on bridges over a river. Nice place to escape from the buzz of Seoul shopping and chill at the nearby cafe for a good sunset view"
116,4.0,"The park is a peacefull place in the middle of the big city, close to Itewon. Very beautiful trees and flowers. Nicely made with paths that are easy to use even with a baby. Very clean and neat."
117,5.0,"You might not think there are places like this in the crowded city of Seoul, yet there are many such oasis as this one where you can retreat for a day.  It was very popular with local people and travelers alike.  Hangang Park (Han River Park) is beautiful and well maintained.The park reminds me a little of Golden Gate park in San Francisco, except this one is not quite as populated by trees and you still see sky scrapers in the distance and occasional reminders that you are still in a big city.  Even so, it is a peaceful place to relax and see friendly local people.  There are many things to do, and you can take short routes or long routes for walking.  If you go down to Banpo bridge, you will see the Rainbow Fountain lights after dark.  Also pleasant at night is the varied color lighting of the trails and trees.  The Koreans have done a nice job on this park.  In some spots there are places to get something to eat, or perhaps order food and have it delivered to the park,  Seoul has many such places that do this.It's easy to get there from inexpensive taxi ride or convenient to the subway system.  About the only time you would probably not enjoy it is during the rainy season of course.   And if you go in the winter, you better keep moving and bundle up with clothes.  This trip was a nicer one because it was in June before the rainy season and not yet too hot or humid.Bikes for rental at inexpensive prices... about 3,000 KRW for first hour and 500 KRW each hour after that.  You might want to do this on your first trip to cover more ground and see more things.  As a tourist, remember to stay out of the bikes lane and into the walk lane,   In most cases, they are right next to each other, so it is easy to become distracted and walk into the bike lane.   While most biker's come along at a leisurely pace, you occasionally are passed by someone who thinks he is in a race to win money!  If traveling by car, there is not a lot of parking, yet we had no trouble getting in there and the price for park is inexpensive.Summary is that it is one of the nicer parks we have visited around the world.  The high rating from most people is due to the combination of many aspects of the park.  Clean, beautiful, enjoying, and several things to do.  It's worth your time to visit at least once."
118,3.0,"This river park is good for long term stay visitors for jogging and walk in the river park, and for cycling if you are cycle mania.however, this park lacks clear division between walkers and cyclists so that there is a possible collision between the walkers and the cyclists."
119,4.0,"Would love to lay a mat, open a bottle of wine on the grass patch and enjoy the buskers performance on a cold autumn night."
120,5.0,"The Hangang banks have been transformed over the past few years and there are great walking paths, benches to sit on and outdoor exercise facilities for anyone. There are bike rental locations and fountains to watch. A great place to get away from the city a bit while still being in the city."
121,5.0,"For me, this is a must in Seoul. Many people, families, couples, and tourists came here for many activities. I rent a bike for a good ride in the park. And if it was warmer, I could have rent a tent for a picnic. The scene of the river was beautiful. And by the night time come, lights’ reflection on the water made the park a very romantic scene. Many couples would be around at this time of the day, so don’t just go there alone."
122,3.0,"Way to kill the romantic night strolls with drunks lying and stumbling around, reeking with cheap alcohol. The night view is good, however, the day would be better with more activities and sober people."
123,4.0,"This is a lovely park that has stunning views of the Han River. Bring your mat, pad, or tent to relax out on the rolling grass hills."
124,4.0,"Nice place to hangout with either friends or family. It's best to come here on weekdays as it might be too crowded on weekends.Bike rental will cost you about 3000won per hour. My friends and i went there at about 12 in the afternoon, and surprisingly there were quite a number of people at hangang park (jogging, cycling, etc...). Anyhoo, if cycling is not your thing, you can stroll around or even ride cruises."
125,5.0,Hangang Park is crowded during weekends especially Sunday afternoon. A good place for family outing and picnic. Beautiful place for cycling too. Hangang Park is less than 5 minutes walk away from Yeouido Church and a minute walk to the subway station.Read more on my blog.http://loveanqila.blogspot.sg/2013/08/travelogue-yeouido-hangang-park.html
126,5.0,"Bike rental were available at 3,000 Won per hour. Cheap and good. Loads of kids and elderly having picnic and playing water by the river. It would be better at weekend night with light shows and fountain performance."
127,4.0,"Hangang Park is simply so big that you see different happenings and people when you visit a different stretch of the long winding road along the river. During the evening you can see tons of locals either coming to Hangang to cycle or simply chill while admiring the beautiful river at night. Not to mention the tons of flyers advertising fried chicken and pizza given out once one exits the closest station to the river : Yeouinaru station. Went there thrice in total - Had fried chicken with friends sitting on the boardwalk along the river on my first time. That's the area where most people simply eat and chill, with the occasional busker playing and singing along to a nice little ditty. Had fried chicken again on my second visit, but this time monsoon season had struck and the river bank apparently was overflooded. The boardwalk now had disappeared and police patrols were advising civilians to go back home. Still had a great time though. Landed up at the cycling path of the river on my final visit, arrived from the bridge connecting Seoul Forest to the park. Tons of cycling enthusiasts and people jogging along the path at night. A definite must visit for travellers and tourists. If you have a penchant for beautiful sceneries and simply hanging out."
128,3.0,"the lane for cyclist, jogger is a bit narrow and the space for picnickers is limited. Good thing is it's not crowded and they provide food delivery in the park!"
129,4.0,The park is more romantic with the lights at night. You can have a picnic or ride a bike while you're there.
130,5.0,"I came here almost every night with my friends during our 3 week stay in Seoul. In the morning, you get to see downtown Seoul across the Han River and just relax in under the sun. In the evening, there's a few live performances (we walked into a live rock concert!) families and friends exercising (outdoor gym equipment (free) & bikes for rental) It's walking distance from the metro station, 63 building, lots of street food carts, and local cafes."
131,5.0,This is a beautiful stretch of bike and walking trails along the Han River. You will see everything from the 63 (tallest building) to the colorful trees (spring) while you ride or run the path. Luckily this is where we choose to do out Semi-Annual Physical Fitness Test... WAY better than a track!!
132,4.0,"I went here at night, to see Banpo bridge rainbow show.There were many local people doing exercised here, or just hanging out with friends. At noon some local picnic here.The rainbow show only 15 minutes, but it was beautiful.Even I can see it when I still ride subway on the way to the bridge.One tourist attraction must see at Seoul."
133,5.0,"Great area to do some sports.. Like a walk, bicycle, jog or just a picnic by the Han river. A bit far from subway station tho..."
134,4.0,The whole cycling path is impressed. The have spent so much time building the whole park and everyone get to enjoy the view of Han's river as well as relax along the river. Good job!
135,5.0,Can be a bit crowded on weekends. Be careful of cyclists if u r a walker or runner. Be careful of walkers or runners if u r a cyclist.Great way to relax anytime of the dayLong trails. Can easily spend hours along the river
136,3.0,"One of our hosts took me for a walk along the river and a boat cruise. It was quite pleasant, with paths for both pedestrians and cyclists, of whom there were many despite it being the middle of a week day. Small stores every so often selling drinks and snacks. Some of the locals were setting up tents for shade (not many trees). I'm told families will come there and call one of the local restaurants on their cell phones and the restaurant will deliver. Enjoyed a glass of citrus tea (tasted like sweetened marmalade) while waiting for the boat cruise. The hostess on the boat spoke in Korean and then put on recordings for English and, I believe Chinese, the time I was there--I assume other languages were available as well."
137,3.0,"I was visiting in Seoul and was taken to Banpo park to enjoy a picnic and the water display with lights off the bridge. It was a lovely evening-- music playing, families, couples, friends, enjoying the great weather and the show of the water and colored lights off the bridge with the city of Seoul in the background. I highly recommend it!"
138,5.0,For a small fee you can purchase a blanket (more like that shiny thing you put in your car windows in the summer) to sit on and just relax.  Lots of people and activity.  Lots of artists performing on the streets when I was there.
139,5.0,"In korea, every place is so beautiful. So as the hongang park. Hangang park exist in many place in seoul, just along the hangang(han river), if you are bored, go there walk for a while, bring some food to there for eat, is a kind of enjoyable."
