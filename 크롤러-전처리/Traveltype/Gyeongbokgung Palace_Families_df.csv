0,5.0,We had a layover in South Korea and decided to take a tour for 5hours and not a moment we regret it. It was a blast. Tour guide was amazing. Food and scenery was lovely. 
1,5.0,"This palace is from the Joseon dynasty, located in the Jogno district. They have the royal changing of the guards ceremony at the main gate (check timings). Once inside one can just stroll through the different courtyards, view the various buildings or take a guided tour. Just"
2,4.0,Easy to reach Gyeongbokgung palace with public transportation and many small restaurants not too far from the palace.
3,3.0,"A rich in cultural and historical value place to visit.Lots of visitor tourists during the winter holidays. A must visit to their HISTORICAL AND Cultural Museum located directly within the Palace vacinity. The museum inside is clean, quiet and warmy-heated during the winter .Has"
4,5.0,Maybe it would be more crowded in non winter time. I was surprised to be the only few souls wandering in the largest palace in Seoul in December.  There are many different buildings aside from the main hall. Do get the brochure to understand what each of them signify.
5,5.0,The palace is well visited by tourist and locals. Do not miss the 2pm change of palace guards ceremony. The ceremony takes place outside the gated zone but getting a ticket to visit the palace is totally worth it.  The place is huge and we spent at least 1.5h walking around
6,4.0,Went to the palace on a Saturday braving the public protest. Witnessed the guard change which was quite impressive. The palace grounds were large and massive but as unguided found it difficult to appreciate
7,3.0,"Nice stroll around but in terms of palaces, it is nothing to wow your senses after you have seen forbidden city in Beijing. They have lovely pine trees there though. "
8,4.0,such an amazing place to visit. we got a chance to wear a hanbok and moved around the palace..like we transfered back to Joseon Dynasty..love the feeling so much.
9,5.0,"This place is huge, elegant and historical. There are a few guards changing event, but the main event happen @ 11am."
10,5.0,"easy walking, visit king n his work place, his family living room etc. also praying place, dining area n servant living area."
11,5.0,It was a beautiful place to spend your day walking around this palace. It is clean but no food available. Entrance fee was reasonably cheap. It is near hanbok village. Great experience for my family.
12,5.0,Very inexpensive and gorgeous grounds to explore. Don't miss seeing the changing off the guards. My teenagers loved it!
13,5.0,The Palace was huge. My family and I went there pretty early to take photos. A must watch is the changing of guards.
14,4.0,"It has some semblance to the Forbidden City but on a smaller scale. Dont miss changing of the guards that takes place at intervals.  Two types of tickets: palace only at W3k and a 4-Palaces combi ticket at W10k. We went for the cheaper one. The main throne hall sits majestically in the centre with other buildings behind, linked by covered walkway. Behind the complex is a garden (I imagine it would be beautiful in summer) and a stream. There is a souvenir shop and toilet. There dont seem to be a place where we are allowed inside so we only take a peep through the window. An experience to immerse yourself in the imperial Korean times."
15,5.0,The place is quite big but not as big as Forbidden city. But the place is spacious for foto shoots. Better wear themed Hanbok for contrast on the building color. Use the Discover Seoul Pass for your hanbook it’s a wise choice.
16,5.0,"Visited this place 2x last month since i didn't know you can't go deeper inside into the palace. In case, if anyone wants to see their guard changing time, 10AM and 2PM"
17,4.0,Nice Place but I just could not get excited about it cos it is not the real thing cos its was rebuilt. A must visit when you ate in Seoul. Try to spend the day around that area. A lot of restaurants and beautiful cafes around the area.
18,5.0,"It is a magnificent building in the middle of a modern buildings. It is easy to locate and nearby got great ginseng chicken soup. If you are not shy, you can rent a hanbok to walk around in the palace. A lot of tourists did that!!!The place is clean and easy to walk around, there is guides if you need one. Free entrance if you wearing hanbok. Overall is a great place for sightseeing"
19,5.0,"Highly recommended to take the free guided tours available. We took the English one and the guide brought us deep into the palace grounds where there were hardly anybody. She also gave a very good background to tje history of the palace and gave us some insight.There is a pre-parade at 945am at the right gate (if u are facing the palace) towards the open air carpark & public toilet. That is worth watching and not many people know about it. After the pre-parade is over, u have sufficient time to walk over to the main parade square to watch the changing of the guard. Best spot is on the left of the kids only area and facing out towards the main gate and main road. Here u can watch the guards marching in from the left and moving towards the main gate."
20,5.0,"You must take the free tour but do look at the timing from their website. The tour is about 50min that bring you around the palace and explain history behind each architecture.Give yourself about 2-3 hours there including the change of guard ceremony (check the timing on their website) should be sufficient. After this, we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village which is about 20-30min walk."
21,5.0,"I was not much interested about this place before going to this palace.Once we reached there,I  rented an Hanbok for ₩9000/2hrs and hair braid  ₩5000.Then that's it,you are ready to capture shots. It was raining heavily when we were there but still it was good.You could hire a guide there so that you will understand the history and culture of that palace.You will find museum which is free entry in the same compound.You can spend around 2hrs in that museum.Overall it was good."
22,5.0,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace has been likened to the Forbidden City in Beijing but  at a more subdued state.  I think however that this is a wonderful experience in itself!  So come to the palace for its own sake!A magnificent piece of work, although a replication since the original build if NS have been burnt down by the Japanese except for the chimney and some salvaged beams (in a well-catalogued display) shown in a little hut towards the back of the Palace grounds just before the second palace.  Unfortunately the explanation is all in Korean (so the newest Google translate app with the camera function is your best friend here!)There are complimentary language guides at designated times through the day if you are interested but the information can be found online and at the website rather than the brochure.  QR code’s and audio guides should help with the visit.Oh, do note that if you wear a hanbok, you enter the palace for free!"
23,5.0,"Historical site, Gyeongbokgung Palace built more than 3400 years ago.  Great to see this ancient and majestic architecture! Complimentary entry for elderly above 65 years old. (Need to produce passports) and those who wear hanbok."
24,5.0,A beautiful and great place to go and take photos. The place is full of history and it is a big area to walk around so you must wear comfortable shoes there.
25,5.0,"one of the best place to enjoy autumn if you are around Seoul. You can make haft day trip by visit Gyeongbokgung, Samcheong-ro and Anguk , all closed to each others and walkable"
26,4.0,Guessed this is a place for people who like to take photos.  Not suitable for people who does not like to take photos.
27,5.0,Huge space with lots of historic buildings in a nice garden area. You can walk around and discover things for several hours.If you rent traditional cloths you can get in for free. Normal fee is 3.000 for adults an 1.500 for kids above.Don't miss the guard changing ceremony at 10am. Be there 10 minuits before to get a good spot for watching.Dont miss the national folk museum right next to the palace garden.
28,4.0,Palace that has interesting history. Most of the original palace buildings have been destroyed. Few have been preserved and some rebuilt. Guard changing ceremony is the interesting part and the guards try to stay still but you could see their eyes wandering and enjoy the giggles from visiting tourists
29,5.0,The place where you can view the traditional palace and pavilion including its beatiful park and background of mountain.
30,5.0,"I would say this is the largest and most grand palace in Seoul. The grounds are enormous with much to see. We went in the morning to see the changing of the guards, which my kids found fascinating. They even had a roped off section for children to sit so they could see better. If you could only see one palace this is the one."
31,5.0,"We did what many tourists did, which is to rent the hanbok or traditional Korean costume for a few hours and walk around the palace. Note that if you are dressed in hanbok, you can enter the palace for free although it will still cost you more to rent the hanbok than the entrance fee.The palace is large and it took us at least a couple of hours to walk around, taking photos and watching the change of guard ceremony. Note that the change of guard ceremony takes place once in the morning and another time to in the afternoon. Try to catch it if you can as it is quite elaborate and there is an English explanation of the ceremony over the PA system."
32,5.0,We took our group of 3 adults and 8 children here for the day.  The littlest ones had a great time as they could wander easily and play in the dirt. Beautiful photo ops. Many choices for Hanbok rental to make some amazing photo memories.  (Renting a hanbok gets your free entrance- no need to wait for the ticket booth!)
33,5.0,"Enjoy the autumn colours and the beauty of the grand palace. Best to visit first thing in the morning, there will be lots of tourists and Korean wearing Hanbok (traditional Korean costume). You can rent the Hanbok for the day and walk around the palace and apparently, if you are in Hanbok, you get to go in for free."
34,4.0,"If you want to take photos and wear hanbok- this is the place to be! If you want a deeper understanding of the history, get a guide. The grounds are expansive and you can spend hours wandering especially if you visit the museum there. However, note that it is not pram/wheelchair friendly. Also, lines to get tickets can get really long."
35,5.0,"First time here after rent hanbok at one of the store for 4 hours. Free entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace if you’re wearing hanbok. Luckily no rain as the palace not all sheltered and it was hot day. Enjoy taking photos all around the palace and great experience to watch the Changing Guard. I spend the time here for 3 hours include my coffee break at one of the cafe, should put more indoor seats as all customer feeling hot and need aircon! Overall its a huge palace, nice to walk around and get many nice spot to take pics wearing hanbok."
36,5.0,"Since we booked a nearby hostel, it was just a good walk from our place. The palaces are quite interesting which gives you an idea of how they used to lived during the old times.It was a good thing that it was not crowded when we visited so we really enjoyed the beauty of the place."
37,5.0,Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful😍 As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!
38,5.0,"The palace is sooo big... and many photo spots in here. Bring your camera. And dont forget to watch guard ceremony @ 11.00 AM, and 14.00 PM ..."
39,3.0,"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts.Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces.On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces."
40,4.0,"Great place to visit if you are in Seoul, gives you a good feel of life back in the emperors time. Only knock is there are no real signs or plaques explaining what your looking at, but for the couple of dollars changed to get in, it was well worth it."
41,5.0,This is a fabulous place for anyone and everyone to explore Korea history. From the palace walls to the museum inside you definitely get a sense of what the old days were like and beauty that Korea has Architect  wise. The price to enter is such a small amount $3 USD or free if you rent a hanbok- which I highly recommended for memorable pictures.
42,5.0,"Beautiful place, definitely a place to visit with family, we got to know and understood a lot of the wonderful Korean culture."
43,5.0,If you are visiting seoul this is one of the places that it must be in your list to visit.Recommend to rent a hanok to wear which is the triditional korean custom and if you dress it you get a free entrace to the palace.The entrace for an adult cost 3000 KRW.Hanok custom rental for 2 hrs cost around 14000- 18000 KRW. Could be cheaper as a just visited on shop so cant compare prices with other.
44,4.0,Royal Guard Changing Ceremony at Gyeongbokgung Palace was very interesting. Royal guard ware traditional cloth.  Please check schedule for this ceremony!!
45,4.0,"This is a huge palace compound. A clear fine product of the Korean Dynasty. There are a few gates and halls with distinctive architects for perfect photo. Even so when one dress in the traditional Hanbok. While the inner compound is stone paved and very bare, there is an outer area of greenery. This is the part we enjoyed most. Old trees, green grass, big pond with the willow trees  which contrasted the inner court. Really enjoy the stroll and relax atmosphere. Another perfect spots for photos."
46,5.0,Cheap entrance ticket or free when you enter wearing with traditional Korean “Hanbok” which can be rented in many shops in Bukchon village.Nice well preserved palaces and beautiful lake.
47,3.0,Beautiful place and big complex. I visited the place with my parents and it is difficult to find toilets around
48,4.0,"This historical palace is not to be missed when you are in Korea.  We enjoyed walking in the grounds of the palace in our hanbok. You can sense the grandeur of the place during its time.  Also, we were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guards ceremony."
49,5.0,This is a very important place for Korean History.  It was an honor to review the palace and see where the Old School Kings lived.
50,4.0,"This place is huge.  Many temples to see and the museums are included with the price.  A lot of walking.  Also got to see the changing of the guard, it is done twice a day.  First one was at 10:00 am."
51,5.0,Traditional custume.can rent and wear it..Creat special moment..it's royal and tradition of Korea.History of Korea
52,5.0,Instagramable view and different area to post even their trees are amazing like from the jungle also good for photo ops
53,5.0,"Such a serene and beautiful palace set amongst the skyscrapers of Seoul. Must visit! Buy tickets online so you don’t ha e to wait in line. There are free tours in English but read the website to coordinate your visit during the times available. Very hot day, so we didn’t rent to wear any of the beautiful costumes. However I heard that if you do wear one, entrance is free. We truly appreciated those who braved the heat and donned costumes as it made our photos even more beautiful and colourful."
54,5.0,"Make sure you find an offline map at the gate.It was a hot sunny day, and we travelled with a baby. The place was stroller friendly. Some of the areas were under constructions, including the famous small lake. But nonetheless, we managed to cover most of the areas and found many cheap and good quality souvenirs at the shop (make sure to try their drinks as well!). We got cute bookmarks, notes, even jewelries.Overall, it was a good place where you can have a leisurely stroll (even better if it's not too hot)."
55,4.0,"A hug palace with historical architecture. If you want to explore this place, you should spend all day, its really big."
56,5.0,"Largest palace, entry free of 3000 won, free if wearing hanbok, must visit and have look at the grandeur, very beautifully maintained. Recommend joining a free tour for a very informative tour around the palace, can enter the palace museum and folk museum for free."
57,4.0,"The place was beautiful and historic. We saw a guard changing ceremony and it was amazing 👍🏻 . There was a hanbok renting, but we decided that it was a too hot weather to rent a hanbok, so we rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village (see review of Bukchon Hanok Village). We took some beautiful pictures. Overall it was beautiful and historic."
58,5.0,This is a gorgeous Palace in downtown Seoul. Most of it has been rebuilt but it is historically accurate. Many people rent traditional clothes just outside the gate and then get in free to see the palace. We did not dress up as June in Korea is so hot.The palace itself is lovely to look at and you need about two hours to see it. Unfortunately you can't go inside any of the buildings; if you could it would really enhance the experience.
59,5.0,"I loved the place worth the visit, wearing the costume and taking photos it makes great memory pictures plus you can do the tour alone after doing some walk from the city"
60,4.0,So we had to walk and walk and see where the women lived and where the king lived and where the conjugated. Sorry not my cup of tea.
61,5.0,This was built 500 years ago and some parts were burnt during Japan invade Chosun dynasty. It was restored and open to public. This palace is surrounded by mountain. Compare to Jaguemsung In China it seems small but this is more delicated. You can feel historic area among mordern Seoul. Nearby this palace you can reach many historic places around Jongro.
62,4.0,"Regardless of the crowd, I still can feel the traditional vibe of ghost of its past. I thank anyone who were wearing hanbok(s) [The traditional Korean attire]. The palace was just okay though but the pillars were still in good structure and gives me the chance to enjoy the scene where the girls in hanbok are just so suited with the palace's pillars, just like what I always see in the historical Korean drama. Apart from that, the change of guard is also a must watch and it is pretty colourful."
63,5.0,What else should be explained? All tourists must go to this place if they visit Seoul for the first time. Do not miss 'Changing of the Royal Guard' ceremony when you visit here.
64,4.0,"Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung is the largest and most important royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was a good experience to take in all the history and architecture of the buildings that comprise the palace grounds. We rented traditional Hanbok at a nearby store for a more Korean historical experience. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that entrance to the palace is free if you wear Hanbok. Many spots within the palace grounds are Instagram worthy."
65,5.0,This place is beautiful with all iconic ancient Korean architecture. You can take tons of photos in every corner. You can enter free if you wear Hanbok
66,5.0,"It was close to 20 years since I visited the palace for the first time and the government has done a great job in continually restoring the structures and grounds that originally were part of the expansive palace.  Knowing this would be the most popular palace to visit, we avoided some of the expected crowds by arriving at the opening.  Adults were 3000Won while our teens were 1500Won.  The main buildings that were most interesting to us were:Geunjeongjeon - Large, elevated hall where the king greeted his subjects or guests. Visible from the outside was his throne and ornately painted ceiling and beams.  This was the first building seen and most popular with the visiting crowds.Gyotaejeon - This was the queen's quarters but the garden in the back with chimneys was more interesting. While not currently landscaped, I could see how it would have been a scenic getaway for the queen from the rather plain palace grounds.Gyeonghoeru - The royal banquet hall was a two story building supported on massive stone columns was but only visible from across the pond.  This was a popular backdrop for many tourists photos that day.More buildings that what I originally remember went on and on including one for the queen's mother, crown prince, and library.  Our last stop was to see the Hwangwonjeong which was built on an artificial island and supposed to be quite beautiful but unfortunately was under reconstruction so all we got to see were the workers and a larger wall.We came back to the main courtyard to witness the colorful changing of the guards ceremony.  Periodically, helpful announcements were broadcasted over the PA system to explain the activities or significance.  This time, I viewed it from inside the courtyard where I witnessed more activities than previously from outside the gate (though having that backdrop was good for photo ops).After the ceremony ended, we visited the National Palace Museum which was on the otherside of the courtyard wall from the ceremony.  That was a good escape from the  heat as the day warmed up."
67,5.0,It's like a picture comes alive... it is nice how the culture was preserve in vast metropolis.. Walking around coz there are different things that you can see and explore.
68,4.0,We made a short stop and just took pictures outside the palace. It is nice to take picture with the palace as the background. The palace is also easy to reach via train.
69,5.0,It is a must visit place in Korea. Visitors can experience by getting wear traditional handbook. Folk museum and traditional village near by also attracted us lot. Thank you Seoul.
70,5.0,This is a great Palace to visit. Palace's history and architecture are great. Visit early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds.
71,4.0,"go with hanbok, then you don't have to pay for the entrance fee. yes, although the fee is cheaper than renting a hanbok, i think you'll feel more in place with hanbok - since many are also wearing them! the place is beautiful, although you might need more time to walk everything - but 2 hours is suffice for phototaking!"
72,5.0,"If you want to know about history and see it first hand, this is the place to visit. It has very interesting story and you will be wowed with its historic sites, buildings and the surroundings. A must visit."
73,5.0,It is within walking distance from our hotel. Vast area and interesting place for a visit. Hop on hop off bus goes to this place.
74,5.0,"A must see for anyone in Seoul. Walking through the palace gives an impression of what 14th century high society in Korea was like. If you are not coming with a guide, go on line and read about the history and locations within the palace for a forfilling experience."
75,5.0,Located in the heart o Seoul and easily accessible by subway. You can spend the whole day wandering around the palace. Do catch the Palace Guard Changing Ceremony.
76,4.0,"The first time I visited the palace was in 2011 to see the residence of Prince Gian and Prince Troy of Princess Hours. NOw that I'm back with my son, we got to discover more about South Korea through the museum and writings about the palace. We toured on our own and it was a warm day so we spent only a few hours here. It was really wide and we got to cool down while we explored the museums in the area.If in Korea, it's a must to see this beautiful structure and I'm glad they preserved the old buildings for us tourists to see,"
77,4.0,"If you’re into history then this place is a must see, if you’re not then you’re better off visiting somewhere else. Tour guides will be provided if you’re keen on knowing more about the history of the place on a timed basis. If you’re visiting on summer, prepare some shades or else you will be fried by the hot summer sun. There are some spots that will only open a few times a day, so if you want to visit a particular area, get your schedule right before visiting."
78,5.0,Nice and ancient grand palace of Joseon Dynasty of South Korea. There are more other palace that should be visited.
79,5.0,My family visited this palace and had a good experience exploring it. The palace covered a big area. Be prepared to walk a bit if you intend to cover every bit of it. Palace is easily accessible as it is located near to a Seoul Metro Station (Gyeongbokgung). You will need to purchase tickets to enter the palace too.
80,4.0,This place was incredible. It was huge and incredibly maintained. We had gone during winter and there weren't too many people and so we were able to really walk around comfortably away from crowd. It was cold in the winter -- just as a precaution. There are nearby stores that rent out traditional Korean clothing for those who want to take pictures; this was very common.
81,4.0,Really beautiful palace. Worth visiting while in Seoul.beautiful buildings and gateways. Clothing hire available. Wonderful architecture.Had a lovely walk around the palace grounds
82,4.0,"Still one of the places to visit when you are in Seoul. The palace is so intricately made and the mountain at the back is so amazing. However, it is so big but there is only 1 or 2 toilets nearby."
83,4.0,"We visited the palace on the last Wednesday of the month, so the admission was free. However, a fee is charged for the guided tour. The palace area was large. There were  many tourists wearing Hanbok at the palace. We saw the changing of guard ceremony. There is also a cafe that sells snacks and souvenirs in the palace area."
84,4.0,It’s a big place with long heritage and old construction building. But I have been to Beijing Forbidden Palace. The construction heritage and treasures of this palace just can’t compare to that
85,3.0,Very clean area and can get very crowded during weekends.  Good for photo shoots. Entrance is free. If you want to rent the Korean traditional costumes it is readily available near the palace before entry and very cheap as well.
86,3.0,"Visited The Palace on our first day in Seoul. It is a beautiful place to visit, but I was saddened to read it’s history as we walked around. So often I learned about the demolition of Korean historical / sacred buildings being destroyed by enemies throughout the centuries. This Palace had been greatly recreated in recent years. Having said that the grounds are definitely worth a visit, tourists can hire Hangbok ( traditional costume)  to wear and visit the palace in and many do and take hundreds of selfies. There is also a Changingof the Guards at certain times. Very colourful."
87,5.0,"Must see buildings, water garden, and crowds all dressed in traditional Korean costumes.  Enjoy the Folk Museum within."
88,5.0,We went through the palace fairly quickly because there were so many people when we were there.   I think school field trip was happening and there were tons of kids everywhere.  It would have been nicer if it wasn't so crowded.
89,4.0,wonderful experience seeing all the people in traditional hanboks everywhere at the palace grounds . A place one should not miss.
90,4.0,"Put on traditional costume to get free entry, and be photographed at your best ancient look! Spend at least 3 hours there as we did, and we also had a volunteer guide (a high school English student) showing us around."
91,3.0,"Although not the most attractive, Gyeongbokgung palace is the biggest and the main palace in Seoul. So, ot is a must visit tourist attraction. Very crowded all the time, free entrance for visitors wearing traditional korean dress (Hanbok), that can be rented near the palace. Quieter areas are the walls surrounding the palace, with the pillars making the colorful walls and ornate ceiling beams more attractive for photos (instagram). Changing of the guard around 11:00am is also an interesting attraction to watch."
92,5.0,"The place is full of people from everywhere who rent a Korean traditional clothes and visit the place. A lot of happy and smiley visitors, which we enjoyed a lot."
93,4.0,"A large territory with lots of rather typical traditional buildings. Nevertheless, a great place to walk around and explore, getting away from the crowd. Talking about the crowd, we've been here on Monday, and while the main square was moderately crowded, most of the territory was not busy at all, and we could still find lots of places to take some nice pics in peace."
94,5.0,The scale of the Palace is amazing. On the day we went there were children dressed in traditional clothes celebrating a festival
95,4.0,Beautiful palace. One of the largest I’ve seen. You can even dress up an the traditional Korean garb and take pictures. A lot of the locals seem to do this. Parking was easy and relatively cheap.  Definite must see if in Korea.
96,5.0,You will be surprise when you arrive in this place. The palace is so huge and you will feel that you live in Joseon dynasty era especially you wear tradional korea custum (Hanbook Cloth) and go around the palace.  The hanbook cloth can be rented in nearby palace area.
97,5.0,"A beautiful place one in Seoul for photo. Entrance fee is W3,000  but free for anyone who wear hanbok dress. The door close at 5 pm. Should have at least 3 hrs here."
98,5.0,"Nice view of the palace with the old and new, the changing of the guard and many people in costumes. It was friendly with a very nice walk and we had a good time even with our 9 year old. Lots of things to see and lots of pictures to take. Very nice walk."
99,5.0,"in the center, nice for about an hours tour and photo ops. price was 200 won,we went the 1st day as an eye opener to Seoul"
100,4.0,"This was a fun place to visit but there are a lot of open spaces with nothing to see. At the time of our visit there was construction going on so it blocked off parts of the grounds but there was also some mini-experiences that you could walk through to see what life might have been like a few hundred years ago. Overall the grounds are very beautiful and it takes time to walk around them. There are lots of good photo spots and about half the people there had rented the formal outfits of Korea’s past. Cost was very cheap to get in. I will say nothing was flat on the inside, little ones that are just learning to walk had a lot trouble."
101,4.0,"We spent about two hours exploring the beautiful grounds of Gyeongbokgung. The entrance fee of 3,000 korean won was waived as we wore traditional Korean hanboks.It was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, but we were able to find some quiet spaces. There is a guard changing ceremony twice a day in the main square, which is pretty cool and also the perfect time to see the grounds as most visitors will be watching the ceremony. You can also join in the free guided tours that are offered several times a day in English, Chinese, and Japanese.It was a pretty enjoyable experience, and it transitions nicely into a view of the Blue House, where the President of South Korea resides, and a stroll through the traditional neighborhood of Bukchon. Highly recommended."
102,4.0,"Family of 3 adults.   Good weather! However, several parts of the Palace were closed for renovation including the Sojubang Kitchen - which was very disappointing :(  However, it was also fun to see plenty of tourists dressed in the national Korean costume 'Hanbok'.  They are available for hire from plenty of local 'costume' shops - and to see them just added to your imagination!  Walking around is very easy and seeing the 'Guards' at the beginning with their flags flying in the wind was also lovely!"
103,5.0,"We got there by taxi and realized that because of its central location many other attractions were within walking distance. The queues were long for the entrance tickets and some people approached us offering Hanbok rentals since wearing one grants you free entrance to the cultural attractions. The rental wasn't worth it considering the starting price was 10,000 won while the entrance only cost 3,000 won. If you're going to +3 places that have entrance fees then it might be worth it there's also a penalty for late returns. Inside the Palace we saw tons of cherry blossoms in full bloom. We rushed to the front entrance when we heard the drums for the changing of the guards but we couldn't properly appreciate it since the crowd was huge and we could only watch from a distance."
104,5.0,"Easy walking, beautiful surroundings you can get into palaces free if you are in traditional dress, it was lovely to see so many doing this. It was a large palace but not too crowded"
105,4.0,"We went with a youth guide who we met while exiting the metro station. He gave us a nice tour of the place lasting almost 2 hrs. Crowds aplenty, many were dressed in traditional costumes from one of the many shops nearby. Do catch the changing of the guard."
106,5.0,"Incredible palace. Totally different, then what we have in Europe. Mistical place full of the spirit of the old times. Great initiative of the young people to be the tour guide for free and in the same time to practice English. You can rent or buy the dresses from the royal family time, walk in palace and feel like a queen or king. Fully recommended for all families."
107,5.0,"The palace is huge and you can find lots of picture-worthy spots. For entrance, you ca choose to rent costumes (hanbok/traditional korean attire) or buy entrance tickets. If you choose to rent hanbok, entrance will be included already, this option however, is more expensive compared to the regular entrance fee but you get to experience wearing hanbok and you will definitely enjoy taking pictures with it. Recommended time is 1 to 2 hours depending on travel speed."
108,4.0,"Arrived here at 2 pm and very crowded because many visitors from locals and foreigner. Cost me 3000 Won per person (free of charge for people using hanbok). There's a guardian changing ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. But it's not a real guardian, only some actor (but they do it very very serious and nice to watch). This palace is very large, but never empty of visitors since it's the main palace. Oh good thing is this object provide free locker where we can put our bag. It's located near from the entrance. Many people come here using hanbok (traditional clothes from Korea). Surely can take beautiful photos here."
109,5.0,A really nice family morning visit to see Korean history and see the sights of an excellently well preserved set of ancient buildings.
110,5.0,Our second time to visit this palace and caught the Changing of the Guard which is a great ceremony to watch. The palace area is huge so you have to be ready to walk but on a nice spring day it was quite pleasant and breathtaking.
111,5.0,We had a visit of the Gyeongbokgung Palace as part of a tour. We had a quick tour of the museum and the palace grounds and the changing of guards. Would love to go back to explore the entire place.
112,4.0,This place is like one of the main places you want to see when visiting korea. Old palaces and good for picture taking. Our tour guide gave us good information of history and culture.
113,2.0,"When I first visited the palace in 2002, I was really in awe of the beautiful structures and the history of the site.  During my last visit with my family, I ended up completely annoyed and found myself hurrying through the palace.  The palace is now overrun by tourists that rent hanboks and are only interested in taking their posed photos, without appreciating the beauty and history of Gyeongbokgung.  Maybe this doesn't bother you, but the experience was ruined for us.  I would recommend going straight to the National Folk Museum first, and then making your way through the palace. I wish that we had done it that way."
114,4.0,"Visited the museum. Very interesting. Next time will consider renting the hanbok and go to palace to take photos. Apparently, entrance fee will be waived. Need to spend at least 2 hours. Weather was cold in March so going into museum was a great idea!"
115,5.0,"This is definitely one the places you gotta visit if you’re going to Seoul, is such a very significant place.You can take pictures of the guards outside the palace, it’s a very huge place where you can fetch many things, at the back of the palace there’s a huge pretty garden, looks stunning when it’s nos autumn 🍂."
116,5.0,"Myeongbokgung Palace is a  place to see while in Seoul, you can rent traditional clothes in Habok rental store for $10  and have picture taken while inside the palace ground. Must to see is palace guard. Food is great and affordable. Close to korean Village."
117,5.0,It was an amazing view to visit this palace and to admire the historical story behind was really mesmerizing. The building was neatly maintained and clean. There is a museum inside which is very much interesting to see.
118,5.0,"This Palace is one of the most popular historical places to visit in Seoul. Some korean dramas have shot scenes here too. There's an entrance fee if you're not wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing). I recommend renting one, I think it adds up to the experience. And lots of tourists are wearing hanbok there when we went there."
119,5.0,"If you are interested both history and scenery, this is the place to go. At 11am you will be able to witness the guard changing at the front of the palace. Besides that, you are also able to do traditional rental dress at the nearby village. At Spring time, there are lots of sakura flowers around the palace area. Walk further in at the nearby museum, if you are lucky there will be some performances"
120,5.0,"Beautifully landscaped, older structures, and beautiful views of Seoul's prominent mountains.  We were lucky to visit on a pleasant autumn day, plenty of blue sky and sunshine.  It was great, very memorable.We took the free tour, in English.  The guide pointed out several interesting smaller details without overwhelming us with too much information.  The Palace is where I first became acquainted with Koreans dressing in traditional outfits and strolling historic places.  I previously thought this was something daffy that only foreign tourists did.  Nope, dressed in traditional vestments is how MANY Koreans experience their own heritage. That was impressive.The Palace is significantly smaller than the Forbidden City in Beijing, which means you can see it all in a morning or afternoon.  As an added plus, the back gate of the palace opens up on South Korea's Blue House.  It was amazing to see the history of the Palace and the present seat of Korea's political structure."
121,4.0,"This may be my second time to visit Gyeongbukgung, but the wonderfully preserved remnants of the Joseon Dynasty is still breathtaking. In stark contrast to the sweltering heat I experienced during my first visit; the chilly winds of early spring were the ones which accompanied me during this visit. During my first visit, our sole focus was looking at the changing of the guards ceremony. In this visit though, the weather permitted us to take our time to go through the different structures within the compound. Due to time constraints though, we didn't have time to check out the National Folk Museum of Korea."
122,5.0,We were lucky weather was perfect sun was out and the trees were in full bloom Although there were lots of people becos the grounds were huge once inside you didn’t feel the crowd at allOur family strolled slowly round and took lots of photos and just soaked in the whole atmosphere
123,4.0,It is amazing how they have rebuilt all Palaces and other buildings that were burned down along time ago. Must have cost a fortuna and they are still rebuilding . Use a guide to inform you.
124,4.0,The Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom and just added to how beautiful and well kept this palace was. This is a must see in the theater district of Seoul.  You can even rent traditional dress(see picture) across the street to wear as you tour the various buildings that make up the palace area
125,5.0,"This is the largest among all the palaces in Seoul. Two hours is not enough to cover and see this grand palace. Seeing the palace with the mountain as the backdrop was majestic. We went on a Sunday so the crowd was bigger.Tip 1 : It might be better to go on a weekday to avoid large crowd.Tip 2 : If you want to veer away from the crowd, proceed right away to the farther parts of the palace since most of the tourist remains at the front.We were blessed to witness the changing of guards at 2pm. I think they do this ceremony every 10AM and 2PM. If you want to witness a historical practice, don't miss this one. :)"
126,5.0,"This is one of the most beautiful architecture of Korea dating from Joseon Period. This is the main royal palace of Joseon Dynasty in 1395. Among the main point here is Geunjeonjeong, the throne hall. The Seoul trip is not complete without visiting this palace, as this palace is one of the most important palaces in Korea."
127,5.0,Palace area is huge. Highly recommended.  Was short on time. Would suggest to keep 1 day only for Palaces..Worth visiting for 3000 K.wons per person.
128,5.0,Arrived at 9 when they opened and was able to enjoy the grounds in relative solitude along with the other early birds. By the time we left at around 11 the crowds were arriving. Amazing architecture and history especially with the hustle bustle of the city as a backdrop. Nice changing of the guard ceremony as well.
129,4.0,"Like many of sites in Seoul a lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese, A lot has been rebuilt to the original architecture, Only down side 95% of the buildings are empty, so gets a bit boring just look at the outside walls which all have the same decor. On highlight is the changing of the place guard ceremony twice a day except Mondays, If you are over 65 take a copy of your passport or other proof of age as its free entry. We also found the last Wednesday of the Month was free.  Expect to spend around 1.5 to 2 hours here"
130,5.0,This is a much larger and more colorful attraction than I imagined. I do recommend visiting here in a rented Hanbok because the setting is just so gorgeous for photos and it is not an overcrowded site. However 2 hours is a standard minimum Hanbok Rental time from most shops near the Anguk subway station and it was just barely enough time to walk to place and through grounds. Rent for 4 hours! Entrance the palace is free - just walk through gate. We lucky to catch blooming cherry blossoms as well!
131,3.0,"Our view of the places was average, nice grounds and Wednesday were free because of Culture day. It was nice to scroll on lesiure day."
132,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is similar to the Forbidden City in Beijing and almost as big, but it's a real pity that many of the original constructs have been torn down by the Japanese. Nevertheless the current compound consisting of original, restored and rebuilt buildings is still impressive. There are free tours available in English (and other languages), and even with 2 young children in tow we managed to pick up interested nuggets of Korean history.Tip: for a bit of fun, there are traditional Hanbok hire stops nearby - many locals and visitors alike will dress up while visiting the palace."
133,4.0,Beautiful place with lots of angle to take photos. Palace guards changing ceremony and Gate Guard changing ceremony occurs at certain timings. You'll see people renting the Korean traditional costume for photos.
134,4.0,"This palace sits conveniently near the center of Seoul and is easily accessible by bus or train. You can easily spend half a day there. There are many Koreans and tourists wearing their hanbok costumes taking pictures everywhere. The area is huge and you need to buy an entry ticket. Its KRW 3,000 for adults and KRW 1,500 for youngsters. There are 2 guard changing ceremonies(at 10am and 2pm), so time your visit so that you can watch the ceremony. There are also guides with different languages at scheduled timings."
135,4.0,"We went on Seollal. It was crowded but because the grounds were huge, we were able to take photos and enjoy the palace grounds without fighting with people. As it was Seollal, entry is free as well! I think that arranging your visit to coincide with the changing of the guards parade will make your visit alot more interesting! Worth a visit!"
136,5.0,We could feel the history of the dynasty which are kept in very good condition. Proud people of this ancient culture.
137,5.0,Gyeongbokgung station exit 3-1 .. there's alot of Hanbok boutiques for rental n walking distance to Gyeongbokgung very near .
138,4.0,... if you're into saegeuk.Wear a hanbok to get into characterBring a friend who wouldn't mind being your unofficial photographerWalkaround the entire palace ground (huge)Go into the Museum to read more of their History
139,4.0,"This Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty built in 1395. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon. Truly history comes alive with daily changing of the Imperial Guards at 10 am and 4 pm. A must see when in Seoul."
140,3.0,"I have been to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand with my family... I’mSorry but the temples and palaces in South Korea are very simple."
141,5.0,"I have visited Gyeongbukgung twice, once in the summer and once in the winter time. I personally hate cold weather, but, Gyeongbukgung is so much better in the winter time. With less tourist and less heat, you can wear the Korean traditional clothes comfortably during the winter time."
142,5.0,Majestic Palace. Enjoyed the changing of guard ceremony. Dressing in Hanbok to tour around the Palace is an experienced not to be missed!
143,4.0,I was lucky enough to arrive in time to see the changing of the guard . Colourful experience . Photo op with one of the guards who looked a little scary . Lovely walking around the grounds and seeing all the people walking around in traditional dress which can be hired locally . I think there is a discount for wearing it too
144,5.0,Great views and tons of places for photos ... but there were too many visitors and you could hardly take nice photos ...
145,3.0,The reconstructed site is a nice place to go for a walk but apart from the nice surroundings it lack interesting appeal.
146,5.0,We went to the palace at afternoon with my kids they love the place and we see kids museum they love it
147,5.0,The architecture is amazing and well preserved its like being taken back in time or being part of an epic kdrama...but the highlight is watching the changing of guards the ceremony in itself is a definite must when visiting this place...
148,5.0,We went to palace without expecting anything and thought it will be only photo taking session but as we arrive at Gyeongbokgung subway we were approached by student who give free service of the palace tours! We were so happy and we understand more about the history of the palace. Overall a great experience visit.
149,4.0,Important to note that a massive section of this is being renovated at the time of writing! Maybe if you read this at the beginning of 2019 err on the side of another palace not covered in hoarding...
150,4.0,A Majestic Palace!! A must place to visit!!! You will be amazed of what rich history it must had held by just looking at the place and the intricate design on the ceilings and in the walls.
151,5.0,Your visit to Seoul Korea is not complete unless you visit the Palace wearing the traditional dress called Hanbok while walking around the Palace and witness the changing of the guard.
152,5.0,Get to the palace early to catch the first change of guards ceremony. There are also tour guides in the different languages that will bring you round the palace. The tour guide we had was hilarious and made the tour even more enjoyable.
153,5.0,"We went on December 30 and the weather was cold but sunny. We went early in the morning as we purchased a hambok rental experience that said we needed to be there between 9:30 and 10:30. If you want to do the rental and see the palace, I do recommend going earlier to beat the crowds. The palace is massive! When I watch K-dramas, these palaces are featured, but I didn't imagine how large the property would be. The buildings themselves are impressive. There are a few showcases of rooms that you can view from the outside. There was also a cafe and restrooms available. It was just fun to walk around in costume and take beautiful and memorable pictures. I read the other reviews that recommended the changing of the guard. The one at 10:00 a.m. was cancelled when we were there, but we were able to view the one at 2:00 p.m. It was quite colorful and beautiful to watch. It lasts for about 20 minutes. If you have time, explore Bukchon Hanok Village on your own afterwards, as it isn't far and it's a beautiful walk around the neighborhood. If you can, time it just before sunset. It's gorgeous."
154,3.0,December is extremely cold in Seoul and regrettably limited our ability to enjoy the experience.We did however enjoy the changing of the guards.
155,5.0,"Simply, you are not visiting Seoul if you do not visit Gyeongbukgung Palace together with Gwanghwamun Gate. This palace carries so much history that it is a must for all visitors to visit. Make sure you catch the guard changing ceremony."
156,4.0,"This Palace, the largest is one of the main tourist attraction in Seoul. Gyeongbokgung or G Palace is said to have been built during 1395, boosts of more than 7500 rooms and spread over 40 hectares. This Palace served as the main place of residence for Kings of Joseon Dynasty, the nobles and the government servants before most part of it was destroyed by fire during the war with Japan.However, the temple complex has been gradually restored after the war by the later kings of Joseon Dynasty and the Government over the years.Today this palace also houses the Korea’s National Palace Museum and National Folk Museum.This is a massive Palace complex needs at least 4-5 hours to have a decent look inside. Plan your visit so that you do not miss the “Change of Guard Ceremony” which is conducted twice a day.And if you are interested to wear the Korean Traditional Costume, you can get the same on rent here."
157,4.0,"Went here with one of my kids and my mom.  Not sure how we would feel about it if we had to pay but we lucked out with free entry as it was the last Wednesday of the month as part of Culture Day. We walked around for about 2 hours and had enough.  On the way out we saw another museum, the National Folk Museum of Korea,  with free entry and had a wander through there.  Could have spent hours there but had other plans."
158,4.0,"A must visit place if one really want to look and feel the true korean culture and heritage. All the buildings are well preserved. To get the best experience, try to go during the changing of royal guard ceremony (everyday, except on Tuesday, at 10 am and 2 pm), it really worth watching."
159,1.0,"Place was so boring. It was freezing and it had literally nothing there. There were costumes for you to wear, but definitely not worth your time :/"
160,5.0,This palace is beautiful and there is much more to it if you go to the back and around the property. Look for the small lake and take instagramable pictures.
161,5.0,went here in winter and i got to see the pond frozen which looked truly magical !! my family and i enjoyed visiting the palace
162,4.0,The design and artefacts inside the museum are well thought out. You can either read the signages or rent an audio self-guide @ 1000W. Entry to the museum is free but you need to pay to enter the palace grounds.
163,3.0,"The palace is rich in history and culture if you’re a history buff. Walking around in the freezing cold was quite difficult because I was with my 72-year-old mom and brother with arthritis. However, it’s a must-visit place in Seoul and we were lucky to witness the ceremony of changing of the guards."
164,5.0,"Hello , Great place to visit suggest you should see guard change and wear traditional clothes .Recommend highly"
165,5.0,"This is the most well-known palace in Korea. Representing Joseon Dynasty, visitors who are interested in Korean history and culture would have fun here.- Visitors in Hanbok are free to enter.- There are special programs like evening performances or entrance to Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. So, check them out on the website. You'll have more fun to join them.- There are ceremonies at Gwanghwamun Gate(광화문). 10:00/11:00/13:00/14:00- Hyangwonjeong Pavilion(향원정) is so amazing with lotus pond. It's still under repair unfortunately. Only watching through small windows is allowed.- Gyeonghoeru(경회루) is a large pavilion with nice pond around. The access is only available during special period.- National Palace Museum(국립고궁박물관) and National Folk Museum(국립민속박물관) locate inside Gyeongbokgung. They are also good to visit."
166,4.0,Wonderful place to visit and explore. Good to read up about the place before visiting as that would add to the appreciation of the place..
167,4.0,We managed to walk to this location as our hotel is located within walking distances. We had wanted to watch the change of guard but unfortunately it was snowing and the change of guards procession had to be postponed.   But we do welcome the snow as it turned the whole palace compound white and it lift the moods of tourists who visited it ! We took some spectacular photos at this location . Highly recommended to visit !
168,4.0,We arrived Gyeongbokgung Palace around 11am and the ticket can be purchased  easily when arrived.  The ticket queue seems much longer in the afternoon when we're about to leave so start early if you can. Most of the visitors were dressed up in Hanbok costume (traditional Korean dress) where you can rent it. Do note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10am and 2pm. There's a free English Guided tour at 11am but I believe there're other timings in the afternoon as well.
169,3.0,"We visited the Palace on a Saturday and was there in time for the Change of Guards ceremony which was held at 10.00am.Don’t be eager to get the tickets without reading carefully the ticket charges. Seniors above 65 can enter free, and child below the age of 7 are free also. Although we are a party of seven, we could have paid for only 3 adults and one child, as the 2 seniors and the child of five years ago were free.After the Change of Guards ceremony, we joined the free tour, which started at 10.30am, for Chinese language. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and very patient with answering questions from the tourists. The explanations were very clear and she did the delivery in an interesting way. History is not necessarily a boring thing if you have someone good at explaining them. Good job to the lady tour guide!"
170,5.0,"Good place for photo memories nothing much to do only to watch the show small show , across the road one shop you can rent the traditional custom per hour and you go inside the place and enjoy taking photos"
171,5.0,"The place is quite big, but guide maps are provided as well as English tours (we just walked around on our own, it was good enough). The performances are VO-ed in English and Mandarin.As we walked along the corridors, scenes from K period dramas I've watched flashed before my eyes haha! Most of the buildings are not the original (no thanks to the Japanese occupation during the war) but rebuilt. They are absolutely beautiful, with gorgeous artwork and minute attention to detail. Later, I watched Monstrum and when they mentioned the name of the hall, I told myself, hey! I've been there!Oh we saw a few Korean young ladies dressed in beautiful hanbok taking pictures? videos? in some of the quieter grounds. Not sure what they were trying to achieve but they were taking turns to run down a stretch and turn around or something. Rather interesting and funny, hee."
172,4.0,"Great picturesque location, even in winter months as water becomes iced and trees shed leaves. Enjoyed the time out with the family. Downside for visits in winter months is that the place is all outdoors. Limited heating areas (only the cafe close to exit). Otherwise a good place for learning Korean history and taking beautiful pictures with the mountains in the background of the palace."
173,4.0,"This is my 2nd time visiting the palace.  But this time around, i had the chance to suit up myself and my daughter in the traditional Hanbok costume.  Walking with the lovely costume to the Palace gives us a brand new experience.  Plus, my daughter had fun time with some of the tourists whom was excited to capture her pic in the costume.  Nice historical place!"
174,5.0,"Well worth the visit, you can feel the history in the place and it's amazing seeing lots of people in the traditional dress .. it's almost like stepping back in time"
175,4.0,"If you’re a fanatic for ancient Goryeo history, probably this will be a good place for you to play princess/prince/queen/king for an afternoon. You’ll be able to rent Hanbok over there and you can take incredible photos with the setting and the costume. Personally I think winter season will be a better time to come as the palace and the snow will make your picture perfect. :)"
176,5.0,Beautiful and scenic also saw the changing of the guard . Please check the website for timing . Must visit to see the scale of the place
177,4.0,"We made our way here on a Saturday morning, and it was very cold in winter. The palace ground is large and very grand.  Definitely a good opportunity to take many photographs and worth a visit if you have time."
178,5.0,We were there for just an hour. But our eyes drank in the beautiful view. The place has a rich history. Most ideal time to visit the place is autumn.
179,5.0,"Stately, commanding buildings. Beautiful lake and pavilion. Mountain views, symmetry. Intricate detail, great line of sight."
180,5.0,A must visit place if you are in Seoul. It's in the middle of the city area and you see a lot of tourist wearing Korean traditional Hanbok. There are shops that you rent Hanbok just outside the palace.
181,3.0,"Small and nothing much to see. I expect that the palace is more or less like the forbidden city in Beijing, but a bit dissappointed after visiting gyeongbokgung palace."
182,5.0,A great experience & great scenery. Enjoyed the nice photographic scene. Do rent a traditional Hanbok nearby to experience the Joseon era aura
183,5.0,"The palace with great history, please accompany with Guide, and have the opportunity to know the history, the people of Korea are extremely good."
184,4.0,I loved the palace. Must visit this palace if you’re in Seoul. It’s the most historical place in South Korea.
185,5.0,The grounds of the palace is huge which cannot be covered in half a day. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking! Shops offering hanbok rentals are many nearby. Visitors to the palace in their hanbok bring back visions fr the royal era.
186,5.0,"Aside from being a popular place for historical dramas, being in Gyeongbkogung took us back to the old times. I really loved how we were able to experience walking around it and just mesmerized by the structure, culture and history that it holds and represents. The details on the palace, the intricacies in the designs is just awesome."
187,5.0,"No stop in Seoul would be complete without a visit to the former imperial palace, and, for such, you will require to leave at least 2 to three hours for a complete visit.The palace complex consists on several inner buildings as well as a Korean history museum at the very rear of the palace.As with most traditional historical Korean building, most of the ground consist of gravel, so wheelchairs and strollers will require extra effort to move through it. Most of the buildings are located a few steps above ground. When planning your visit, you should check in advance the times for the changing of the guard, which, by itself, is quite a colorful sight."
188,4.0,Very interesting place. I'm sure it is even more beautiful in the summer months. Only wish there were more signs in English explaining the various buildings. Saw many locals going into the buildings to pray but we weren't sure if tourists were allowed and if they were what the protocol was to enter. We didn't want to be ride or inappropriate and enter so we just admired the beauty from the outside.
189,4.0,"It's a great palace, like any other I suppose. I tend to imagine what it was like living in a place like that centuries ago while roaming around. Do swing by.I had a good experience."
190,3.0,Supposed to be the largest. Not that impressive but restoration effort is still on-going. The changing of the guard held at the main gate added to its appeal
191,4.0,The palace ground is so big that 2 hours tour is not enough. The palace are well maintained.  Free entrance if your wearing hanbok outfit.  Palace guard perform traditional drum parade.
192,4.0,"if you not a history or archi buff, all korean palaces look almost the same to the untrained eye. This is no different. But the changing of the guard ceremony at 10am or 2pm is worth catching.  The ceremony is free but hte palace entry is payable.."
193,4.0,"The Palace full of beautiful autumn scenery but also have renovation at major attraction, so cannot fully experience whole beauty of the Palace. The experience of wearing the costume is unforgettable and the changing ceremony also interesting. Not to be miss."
194,4.0,"Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Gyeongbokgung palace which served as the household of the Joseon dynasty. The grounds are beautiful and the architecture intriguing. The tickets were reasonably priced and there are free English tours a couple times a day- ours was at 1100. Sadly you don’t get the opportunity to enter any of the traditional buildings and the grounds are rough making them inhospitable to collapsible strollers. Still worth the visit."
195,5.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must see, the most iconic sight in Seoul. The palace was build in 1395 and it was the largest of the five grand palaces in Seoul. The name Gyeongbok means “greatly blessed by heaven” The architecture , the trees and the mountain reflect spectacular views. Great place for photographers, history lovers, and art lovers. It is stunning in all seasons white in Winter, pink in Spring, orange in Autumn and green in Summer. Tours are available in English language, you can rent the “hanbok costume” and walk through the palace to take photos. The palace also has the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National  Folk Museum of Korea"
196,5.0,It is one of the important landmark to visit when you're in South Korea. Huge place with plenty of history. Worth a visit.
197,5.0,We arrived in time for the changing of guards ceremony.  After watching the ceremony and taking photos we proceeded to rent some Hanbok to wear.  We easily found one near the gate.  Rent the hanbok for 4 hours so we have an ample time to explore.  The place is big enough that you have enough private space even though there were a lot of people during our visit.  Lots of areas for photo ops with all the traditional Korean architecture all around.   We came during autumn so the colors of the leaves enhances more the beauty of the palace.  There were also lots of tourist that came in hanbok.  Definitely had a great time with this experience.
198,4.0,A good visit to understand the erstwhile Korean royal traditions. Wearing the Hanbok is an option to consider
199,4.0,"From the nearest metro to the palace is quite far. Just head straight to the statue and the palace gate is behind it. There is exhanging of the guards during specific times, so be sure to check it out before heading there to not miss it out."
200,5.0,"The culture of Joseon dynasty is almost similar with China Beijing palace too. The palace ground is not so huge but it is good for photography.Before visiting other palace, this is the main building for administrative during the Joseon era. Many of the buildings has been rebuilt and maintain as it was during that time. Now it is a musuem for everyone to enjoy."
201,5.0,"It is a huge palace with huge compunds. I assume the palace must be a very busy place with lots of activities going on, during those days. Another attraction is of cours the president’s official residence, which can be viewed from one of the gates in the palace."
202,5.0,"I went there with my family wearing the Hanbok, so we got the free admission. The place is wonderful, and not too crowded. Lots of chance to take good photograph."
203,4.0,It was a great place to see how Korea's royalty used to live.  The tour guide told us that there was no longer a royal family but the structures were still preserved and respected by Koreans.
204,4.0,"I would suggest to go early. So that you can get your insta-worthy shots without too much background distractions. We reached the palace around 10am-11am and it is already packed. It might be due to that I visited the palace on Sunday. Such a shame that I didn't get to watch the guard changing ceremony.Good thing that our tour guide is well versed with the history of the palace, so we don't have to use the tour provided by the palace."
205,5.0,"other reviews have summarized the palace nicely so i'll just add a few extra points:- changing of the guard happens twice daily. i saw the morning change and the route goes from the side door by the ticket booth to the front main entrance at gwanghwamun gate, with most of the action taking place in the middle aisle approaching the gate. situate yourself accordingly.- attempted to use the discover seoul pass for palace entry and we were denied by two different ticketing agents. it's only 3000 krw though so paying the entrance fee wasn't an issue. just a heads up for others using the pass!- didn't join a tour group because of time constraints but if you have the time to wander the grounds slowly, i'd suggest joining a free tour group! you'll get even more insight than just from the pamphlets. - while there are some ramps available, the grounds as a whole aren't very wheelchair friendly. i saw a few elderly tour groups struggling to push people in wheelchairs over the stone pathways. i can see the terrain and general layout of many thresholds and stairs as  being a hazard for people using canes, walkers, and other mobility aids."
206,4.0,The Palace is at The Center OF The City. IT has three gates and at 10am there is The changing OF The guards. The events takes about 15 to 20 minutes. The Palace grounds is huge and The Center is The throne Building. You can see Thru The Front door to see The throne but you can not get inside. Then you can see The living quarters OF The royale at The back. Be ready for The crowd but a worthwhile activity.
207,4.0,Its a good place to visit if you are one interested in the cultural experience exploring new places. Try renting a Hanbok while walking around the place. It was a bit crowded when we were there (peak season) and dont miss the Changing of the guards ceremony (check the times when you visit)
208,3.0,I feel like i enjoyed the people wearing their traditional costumes more. The palace itself is not so much an attraction for me.
209,4.0,"Quite busy with Hanok wearing tourists but the palace is great to walk around and take it in , especially when it's a sunny day"
210,4.0,nice and scenic. good for pictures taking. must rent the costume from the east side of the palace. free entrance if you are in costume. otherwise need to purchase ticket.
211,3.0,"One of the major palaces in Seoul city center. All tourists tours will definitely make a stop here. The place is nice but its just too pack with people. Opt for the other palace, although smaller but you get to enjoy it"
212,5.0,"This is the only palace we visited during this trip, we did make an online reservation 3 days ago in order for us to join their palace tour. Same entrance fee for visitor with or without the guide, we have chosen the morning session and very lucky that the weather is so good and we managed to get some nice photos. My own opinion, if you would like to take more photos then try not to follow the guide, we drop the group half way so that our time is more flexible and no need to rush, remember the palace is very big, it is not easy to finish the tour and then walk all the way back to the place that you want to take photos."
213,5.0,"One of the most iconic sites in seoul. You need to buy a ticket to visit the rest of the palace’s compound. There are more residences, hall and pavilion inside the compound. You can also see the changing of the guard ceremony at the gates. Its free."
214,5.0,No comment. This the best Palace in Seoul compare to other palace. The view is prefect even without autumn leave. Must visit.
215,5.0,We enjoyed our visit to the Palace and especially the surrounding park and open area. The weather was sunny and pleasant so there were many people wearing traditional Korean costumes which created a special atmosphere and beauty. Costumes can be rented a shops around the park. Definitely worth a visit and even donning a traditional costume!
216,4.0,I had fun visiting this place and reading about its history. Some people dressed up in the national attire which made me feel like I travelled back in time.
217,3.0,"Make sure you catch the English(or your language) free tour they offer twice a day. Without that and coming from more grandiose places( in India), this might not look like a big deal unless you learn the history."
218,4.0,Impressively large courtyards leading to the main palace. Arrive early in the morning to have no crowds and the whole place to yourself for great photos. Not much shade so bring an umbrella when it's very sunny outside.
219,4.0,"We went there in summer, it was so hot and crowded at the same time. We enjoyed visiting historical palace in Seoul eventhough only for a while because there were many good spots to take photo and the sunlight really supported us :)"
220,5.0,"After a nice lunch at nearby famous  eatery, we walk to Gyeongbokgung, the weather is cool but the sun is torching above us. The surrounding atmospehere is great because you can see a huge percentage of people wearing hanbok, Korean traditional costume and alot of people are shooting photo like pro inside the place.And so coincidence the day we visited is the beginning of chuseok, where the entrance is free to every one, the palace it self is quite a huge area, the setup and building is heavily Chinese influence.My kids are having lot of fun inside, because they can run around the palace spacey area, they have a small cafeteria inside where you can have sip of coffee and some light korean delights.  In it there is a small section of souvenir corner too where you can get some Gyeongbokgung Palace related items"
221,5.0,"At first I wasn’t aware that my time of visit to seoul coincide with one of the biggest Annual Korean Holiday which is Chuseok or Korean thanksgiving. Me and my family decided to visit Gyeongbokgung during the first day of chuseok (we had prior research on which place will open during that time and Gyeongbokgung Palace happen to open during that day). Keep in mind, turns out the entrance fee during chuseok is free for public during chuseok days ! The palace was really crowded with people and best time to visit is during lunchtime. Although it will get real hot since the sun is just right above us ! But all in all we had a great time there, even my sister and mom decided to rent a hanbok (Korean traditional dresses) to get into the spirit of festivity."
222,5.0,A highlight of a trip to Seoul. So beautiful to see locals wearing the traditional hanbuk outfits. The downside? The multitude of selfies taken by tourists!!! Doesn't anyone enjoy sightseeing anymore?!
223,4.0,"The location of the palace is accessible by subway and there are lots of helpful signage to reach the area. Take note that the palace is HUGE - so pls wear proper walking shoes and be prepared for some exercise! If you rented a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) then you would be waived for the entrance fee, but for those who wear the usual clothes, you need to join a long line to queue for entrance fee of KW6000. We arrived just in time for the activity for training palace soldiers on attack and defense, it was quite a show by the soldiers complete with drumbeats and war-cries. After that was the activity for changing of the palace guards, which had a marching band and another set of cultural steps to show the audience. The costumes were lovely and really brought us back to feeling the age of that era!The buildings are really something to admire the intricacy of designs and the entire palace grounds layout is amazing. The flooring is mostly made from uneven stones, so pls ensure you have proper shoes to walk steadily. It makes me wonder how do people from those days run on such ground!"
224,4.0,"We visited this place with two children.It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend.Give enough time .Lots of walking .We took English speaking guide,Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up.Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens. ."
225,4.0,I bring my daughter use wheelchair. She is very exciting to see king's palace..but unfortunately she's can't explore because the location is not very friendly for wheelchair. Hopefully someday uf we can back to Seoul again the goverment make some revolution for wheelchair can more convenient.
226,5.0,"Visited this palace with family.We rent hanbok, so we can take a nice picture around the palace.If you are wearing hanbok the traditional outfit of Seoul, you can enter the palace for free.You can also see the ceremony of palace guard changing at 10 AM.You can rent the hanbok outside the palace and walk accross the street to enter the palace."
227,5.0,Gyeongbokgung is a must visit attractions in Seoul. Easy access from every corner of Seoul. This vast palace complex is well preserved and well maintained. It took more than 3hours to tour this complex. You can learn the magnificent Koryo Kingdom from this palace.
228,5.0,"Hands down this is the best historic site to see in Seoul. Although it is not the original structures from hundreds of years ago, as the Japanese have repeatedly burned the down over the years, it is still very nice and provides a view into the Korea of yesteryear. If you are in Seoul and enjoy architecture or history this should be at the top of your list."
229,5.0,"At first I thought this would only take a half hour to get the gist of, but we ended up watching the changing of the guard, strolling around the pond, and also seeing the throne room, which was all nice. Then we moved through the historic village on the premises and really liked that. We didn’t go inside the cultural center or the gallery on the grounds. We ended up spending two hours, and could have stayed longer. Well worth the entry fee of around $3."
230,3.0,"We took the train and came out on the opposite end and hence we didnt know there was another exit where you will see rows of rentals of hanbok. We went into the palace expecting to rent hanbok for the children and realized they were outside (we saw many of them when we left). Would be nice if there is a notice board or something where they can inform us where to go for the rental. If you are coming out of the palace, turn to your left towards the station. when you hit the first traffic light, you will see lots of rental shops opposite. That's the place to rent your hanbok for photo taking. The palace itself was nice but probably I was expecting more. The palaces look pretty much alike and nothing much to see for us. Probably they do not have a richer and older history as China. We practically walk everywhere in the compound and our last stop was the library where you will have to take your shoes off and be real quiet! I don't think I enjoyed unless there was an event there. If not, I think its worth to skip it unless you really want to dress in your hanbok and walk under the hot sun (yes we went in June)!"
231,5.0,"We went here with 3 children aged 7, 4 and 1. The palace itself is really gonna bring you hundreds of years back to the times of the royals of Korea. A huge area to explore, and definitely you must explore and take pictures at every corner of the area because of its picturesque surroundings. My kids were quite tired of us stopping and taking pictures, thank God we brought strollers with big tyres (the palace lawn is mostly of white pebbles) thus it was easier to push. You can also rent a hanbok here (apparently every young visitors do that!) and your instagram worthy pics taken, lol. Do check the weather. I had my pic taken on a great sunny day. Thus the pic of me with the palace as the background was made more memorable with strings of cloud and very blue sky.Don't forget to wait for the guard changing march. I think it's at 2-3 pm. Worth the wait!"
232,4.0,"You can go there by subway. Just the subway line 4 to Chungmuro and transfer to line 3 to Gyeongbukgong station. Then, walk towards the exit 5 to reach the palace.The entrance fee to Gyeongbukgong Palace 3,000KRW per person. There were many teenagers and couples visiting there by wearing hanbok and took memorable picture. Inside the castle site there guided English speaker who will assist you in the castle tour. The castle area was large. Make sure to wear proper shoes. You can also visit National Palace Museum of Korea. The admission is free. There are exhibitions of traditional clothing and architecture of royal family history. You can relax in the air-conditioning building while learning the Korean history. There are also free access to clean lavatory and free water to drink in the museum. Overall experience visiting there was good."
233,5.0,"We loved this place. It is very big, its not only one palace but a series of royal palaces and gardens as well. You should allow about two hours at least to see it all.  and it was so great that when we arrived we found out there was a free English tour every hour o half hour, which takes over one hour. The guide was a really nice Korean girl and she took us to the most important parts of the palace and gave us very very interesting explanations about the life there, the architecture, etc. After the tour is done she recommends you to go to the rest of the places in the palace complex - its huge, but we already learned some background about it. There are two museums very close to the palace, so it may take even half a day to see it all. Definetely worth visiting."
234,5.0,"Lovely Palace with a colourful Royal Guarding Changing Ceremony every day at 10:00 and 14:00, except tuesdays . Don´t miss it. In the middle of a hightech city, an ancestral ceremony."
235,5.0,"To learn about South Korean history, there is nothing better than this amazing palace. We didn't book a tour but we did it ourselves. Before the visit, we had to document ourselves to learn about this amazing country Every step took us to the hidden gems of this palace. We had a great time. There is a small admission fee. But if you rent the costume, you don't have to pay anything. The costume itself speaks volumes about the Korean traditions, customs and way of life. It's worth the visit."
236,5.0,"Nice place to educate foreigners of a part of the history of korea. We were with a guided tour and it was pretty awesome to know a lot about the story of the palace, and the royalty."
237,5.0,Good  educational things kids can learn and some kinds of activities they can experience. Yuo could have some life time good pictures.
238,5.0,"This is the first and grandest of the palaces in Seoul. You may rent a hanbok just outside the palace. If you wear a hanbok, the entrance fee is waived. It was very nice taking our pictures wearing the hanbok in the different very picturesque buildings, hallways, and walls. They have a changing of the guard ceremony in the morning. Unfortunately, we were not able to watch it.  This is the palace you must visit when you are in Seoul. It was really fun posing like K-drama actors."
239,5.0,"The Palace was magnificent and the area is quite huge. We rented a Hanbok ( traditional korean attire ) We wore it roaming around and it feels like going back through time. it will also save you from paying for palace entrance and going thru long queing lines going inside. We were also lucky to witness the changing of the palace guards. There was a traditional ceremony, guards were wearing korean warrior outfits. We were also amaze with the structures of the palace and easily appreciated the korean culture. Must see at seoul."
240,4.0,We went here before the Changing of the Guards ceremony and there were a lot of people already. Better to visit wearing a hanbok to truly feel the ambiance of the place and of course for pictorial sessions. :) I would love to visit again!
241,4.0,"Very well-maintained palace. This is one of the 5 major palaces available for tourists in South Korea and I think the one that’s most accessible. There are 2 main entrances to this palace, we went through the entrance outside of the National Folk Museum of Korea, which was free, so you can also visit that place before going to the palace itself."
242,5.0,"This palace just goes on and on. Many people arrive in traditional dress which really adds to the experience even if you don’t dress up yourself. The palace is similar to other East Asian ones if you have visited China for example. Opportunity to indulge in a royal afternoon tea, or visit the folk museum (fee). Alternatively go into the Royal Palaces Museum right next door.Great way to spend a morning."
243,5.0,"If you have a choice, do not visit in the summer... it is way to hot. In any case we enjoyed as much as possible and there was a nice museum at the end of the palace which was interesting."
244,5.0,"I'd highly recommend starting your stay in Seoul at Gyeongbokgung Palace.  It's very picturesque and takes you back to another time.  Also, it was very interesting seeing the Blue house nearby with all the security guards at the end of my exploration of Gyeongbokgung!  Also, it's near Bukchon Hanok Village, which shows a bunch of traditional Korea houses.  Prime location to start your exploration!"
245,5.0,"one of the beautiful palaces. Huge and probably will take most of your day.The tickets are cheap and if you wear korean dress, then its free entry.Change of guards is good but not as good as Buckingham palace, London"
246,4.0,"A lot of people don't know that you can try on the guard costume for free right after the Changing of the Guard ceremony. There's this building on your left once you enter through the main Gwangwhamun gate that appears to be closed during the Changing of the Guard. Once it ends, there are women in hanbok who come and open this building. You can choose which costume you want to wear. The building is only open for a very short time (maybe only for 30 minutes?) and you cannot wear the costumes to go into the palace. You don't have to pay anything though, and you can take pictures using the gate and the palace as a backdrop.We were there on a Monday morning to catch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. It was quite a long walk from the Gyeongbokgung subway station (give 10-15 mins allowance). I didn't really understand a lot of what was going on despite the loudspeakers, but the Changing of the Guards looked pretty interesting. You could take pictures with the guards in front of the gate after the ceremony.There are free English tours offered at certain times, but we chose to do a self-tour. We were there for less than two hours, and only chose to check out certain parts after the Changing of the Guard - the Throne Room, the two pavilions, and a bit of wandering around the other parts. You can easily spend a whole morning or afternoon here, considering they also have a free museum inside the palace. A lot of people came dressed in hanbok, and it was admirable to see them as the weather was pretty hot and stifling when we were there end of July!You can catch a glimpse and take a photo of The Blue House coming from within Gyeongbokgung Palace. Keeping the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion walls (the two-story hexagonal pavilion that's currently walled up as of July 2018) on your right, and the Jibok-jae building in front of you, keep walking until you see a gate with guards on your left. (The gate is closest to the Jibok-jae building within the Palace, and is on the north area of the palace complex.) Go out through the gate, and you'll see a larger gate with guards on your right. You can go out to take a photo of The Blue House across the road, but be sure to keep your Gyeongbokgung entrance ticket with you as you re-enter Gyeongbokgung!"
247,4.0,"Went for a short visit as it was way too cold.. Was - 13 that day. Didn't not manage to go for the free guide tour as well but we managed to catch the changing guards ceremony, it was magnificent. Overall quite a nice place to visit."
248,5.0,"The changing of the guard at Gyeonngbokgung palace is a lot of fun.  It's easy to get a good viewing spot and take photos.  The ceremony itself is colorful and lively.  The best part is when it's over, you're allowed to take photos with the participants."
249,4.0,"be sure to visit this palace - the first and main of all palaces own by the chosen dynasty.lots of people walking in traditional Korean clothe, the place is really big and interesting to see some Asian traditions."
250,5.0,"Even on a hot day, you'd still want to visit the place to see the sights, the intricate designs, the culture and it's great for picture taking. There were a lot of people but the place is big enough to go around. You'd definitely should put this on your itinerary."
251,5.0,"It was a very hot day when we visited, but it's so worth it.  My kids rented the traditional Korean costumes (Hanbok) before entering the palace.  It's free admission if you are wearing Hanbok.  The place is huge, we visited a few of the main buildings, very beautiful paintings/decor.  Lots of places to take good photos.  You can get there by subway with a short walk, it's definitely worth a visit!"
252,5.0,"i went there during winter, the lake was frozen, there was snow everywhere on the land because last night of my visit day was snowing so it was so beautiful. there, you can take a lot of pictures, it is the largest palace, just a very historical place, i would recommend other to go to this palace first, and then go to the gwanhwamun, take a picture of king sejong, walk down to cheonggyecheon stream (make sure, you check the festival event, there may be a lantern festival at night ). it is a lot of walking and please wear sneakers. then take a lunch and go to the bukchon hanok village."
253,5.0,"The place is magnificent, building impressive with color and artistic details. People were wearing traditional beautiful Korean costumes.Changing of the guard was an attraction.This place transported me in ancient times.Thank you!"
254,4.0,"Gyeongbokgung Palace located in the buzzling area of Seoul. However it keeps the tradition such as changing guard activity. The admissions is 3000 Won, but it is free for those who wear hanbok, the Korean traditional costume. So I chose the experience of wearing hanbok, pretending to be a Korean Princess while going around the palace. It was quite enjoyable although for only 2 hours, as we went there in summer and it was really hot inside hanbok :)"
255,5.0,"One of the great things about Seoul is that the old and new are within reach in the capital. You will pay a small fee to get into the palace but it is worth doing. Due to proximity, consider doing Changdeokgung Palace and Bukchon village at the same time."
256,5.0,"Amazing great experience - you should see the changing of the guard. Bring an umbrell , fan and or hat as this is a sun soaked experience. I must have lost 2 lbs of water weight seeing this great ceremony. We were on a tour for this which is good as they could explain all the nuances of the site"
257,5.0,It’s mandotary to see. A ceremony is done in the enterance at 10:00. It’s a pleasure to watch. You have to spend at least two hours to visit.
258,4.0,Nice place to walk around and visit the different chambers... It is nice to have a guide to explain the history...
259,4.0,"The main and largest royal palace built during the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung Palace takes you back in time to see how it was like during those days from visiting the on-grounds museums or even trying on a traditional hanbok for photo taking and the experience! Do check the timings for the changing of the guards for an interesting show as well :)"
260,5.0,"Massive palace, maybe going in the heat of august was not a good idea, but overall it was a nice experience to visit"
261,5.0,"The palace visit was very fun and education. Renovations had not changed the palace completely, so you can still enjoy and look at ancient history, culture and style influence of Seoul. Definitely worth going there for a full day, and easily accessible by metro, taxi and bus."
262,4.0,"This palace has a very large area which is divided into several parts. The front of the palace as in the palace there are generally guard guards where tourists can take photos and if we are lucky we can witness the procession of replacing the palace guards.The middle part is the king's palace which is not too big but magnificent. Then on the side of the palace there is a very large garden, very beautiful and very suitable for relaxation. Tourists can relax in this area.In general this palace has a high historical value for the population of South Korea. and as information if the diatric straight line, this palace has a straight line with Seoul Tower or Namshan Tower"
263,5.0,"Even in hot summer, there was lots people here. Some wore Korean traditional costume and took photos, with many of them were non-Korean. There is a subway station that can reach to it directly. There is a museum next to it and free of charges. A good place to hide from the strong sunshine for a while. With many big palace houses, a must go venue for costume photo taking. Better go earlier to avoid the crowds. But if you the guided tour in several languages, you need to go after lunch."
264,4.0,"We went to Gyeongbokgung Palace in Autumn 2017. To enjoy the palace with fewer crowds, it is best to get there early in the morning if possible just when the gates opened at 9:00 am.Get your tickets from the main ticket booth just inside of the main  Gwanghwamun Gate, to the right and grab one of the guide map brochures at the booth.Our walking trails was past the Gwanghwamun Gates to the Geunjeongjeon Hall is the main throne hall of Gyeongbokgung Palace. You are not allowed into the premise but you can take pictures from the outer side through the windows.Next would be the living quarters of the King and Queen -Gangnyeongjeon Hall, named after the virtue of health, served as the living quarters and resting area for the king and the Geoncheonggung Residence.Gyotaejeon Hall, located behind Gangnyeongjeon Hall, was the main living quarters and resting area for the queen. Head towards the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion supported by 48 stone pillars and set in a lotus pond, the pavilion was a favored place for the King to entertain visiting dignitaries. Interesting fact - A bronze dragon was discovered in the bottom of the pond below Gyeonghoeru Pavilion when it was drained for cleaning in November, 1997In what ever sequence you do get around, take the time to enjoy the little nuances of the palace. 1. The Haetae (A 'lion' guardian stone statue) - Upon seeing the haetae, all civilians are supposed to get down from their horses or carriages and continue to walk to Gwanghwamun Gate2.Net or fork-like tools on the roof tops to discourage birds from perching3. Notice the elevated footpath on the center which is reserved for the king.4.The court officials stands/sits by the stone marker that indicates their rank.5. The Metal Rings found near the store markers are actually tent ring to keep the tent in place for protection from sun or rain for the court officials waiting for the king.6.The palace uses Ondol system (traditional Korean floor heating). The floor is heated with smokes runway underneath it.7.The sun and moon painting that can be seen in each of the grand palace behind the King’s throne8. And with our basic feng shui, do enjoy the beauty of the palace which is located in an auspicious site with Namsan Mountain and Cheonggyecheon Stream in the front and Bugaksan Mountain at the backOperating Hours:March to October 09:00-18:00 / November to February 09:00-17:00Interpretation Services (1 hour):* English: 11:00, 13:30, 15:30* Japanese: 10:00, 12:30, 14:30* Chinese: 10:30, 13:00, 15:00Getting Here:Gyeongbokgung Station (Subway Line 3), exit 5.orGanghwamun Station (Subway Line 5), exit 2 and walk 400 meters."
265,5.0,This was a lot of fun. beautiful place to visit. Inexpensive and friendly staff. It was the chinese new year when I went so everyone wore their formal attire whenever they were out.
266,5.0,The palace is a must see for ALL . Tickets needed to be bought from the right side after the main gate to be able to see the inside .U can also buy traditional uniforms and dresses to look like old fashioned Korean .We kept place and almost always crowded .
267,5.0,One of several nice palaces in the north of Seoul.   Close to Insadong but peaceful (apart from the occassional giant tour group)
268,4.0,"Large, huge and beautiful. We have to spend min 2 hours to explore all the palace. Some attraction also good to watch."
269,3.0,"This is the biggest of the 5 palaces of Seoul . Is really big and you will need like 2 hours to see it all, the most interesting part is the museum and the Chinese zodiac escultures. Another good thing is the free bathrooms but apart of that is very similar to the palaces of Japan or China, maybe the most interesting thing to see is the constant ""this building was destroyed by Japan"" comment. Finally , the main activity here is take amazing photos, I suggest to rent a traditional Korean dress and go crazy with the Instagram photos, check different prices for renting this clothes."
270,4.0,"Visited on a really hot day in summer. Be aware that there is little shade on the paths and none at the Changing of the Guard so bring sunscreen and an umbrella or cover up. We used the audio tour which was 5,000kw (you need to leave a form of ID as collateral). It was a good one because it paused until you indicated you were in the right area rather than it continue and you're struggling to get to the next spot. I think I would have preferred a tour with a guide though. I didn't feel like I got enough of the history from the audio tour. Keep walking right to the back of the Palace gardens to get a view of the Blue House (Korea's version of the White House).The highlight was the re-enactment of the Changing of the Guard so be sure to look up when that's on. I wish I had dressed up in the Hanbok (I had even found one that catered for bigger western sizes) but it was just too hot. I already suffered in the sun. Try the teas at the kiosk!! Yum but very sweet. It was very easy to get to the Palace on the Subway, a side pathway takes you straight there."
271,5.0,Second time going here; this time with family. It's always a great place to go to appreciate the history of South Korea. Our family was lucky to enter without a fee when we went.
272,4.0,We enjoyed visiting the palace....honestly the place was out of this world....very quiet...green scenery a real flash from the past kind of an architectural building strongly recommend everyone to visit.
273,5.0,We spent a few hours walking around the palace grounds. It was much bigger than we expected but the architecture was beautiful and well kept. We had a 3 year old with us and he loved exploring the countless pathways until he got tired and opted to ride in the stroller. They had many ramps around the palace so the stroller was not a problem. Overall a very worthwhile place to tour in Seoul for a step back in to history.
274,5.0,"very huge palace depend on your pace, need 1-2 hours to visit, and , enjoyed guard changing parade. we clicked snaps with palace guards, it was very nice experience. my children enjoyed a lot."
275,3.0,"Compared to most our palace visit, this was uninspiring.  I thought it would be much bigger, but the King's palace is very small.  I don't get the barrier around the pond with windows to peek through to see the Pagoda, looks abandon.  Aside from the entrance guards, there are nothing to interact with after the guards, just a few old buildings, you can walk through this in about an hour, will be bored after the palace.  The most interesting thing was seeing all the Chinese tourists dressed in traditional attire walking around, we took pictures with a few.  Need signage to describe what we are looking at, I rented the audio guide, without that, one would be clueless on what they are looking at."
276,4.0,It is a must on your itinerary. You can easily spend half a day here. A large complex. The changing of guards ceremony is highlight and is a must see. (check the timings before visiting).
277,5.0,We attended a guided tour in English. The guide made the tour extra interesting and funny. One of our top excursions on our Seoul journey.
278,5.0,"The day we went there was light rain. We still enjoyed walking around and taking pictures. We arrived early so it was not crowded. As we were leaving the crowds were arriving. I would add this to you list of ""must see"" items in Seoul."
279,4.0,Like the palace from the outside...it is a pity visitors are not allowed to look inside rooms inside the palace. But in July the weather is really hot even for us from tropical country ! It is definitely better to visit in spring or autumn season. We look around the palace just after a quick tour inside the museum.
280,5.0,The changing of the guard should not be missed.  It was definitely a high light of our vacation.     It was beautiful to see.   The Palace was impressive and out tour guide was very informative in explaining the history and culture.   So go with a guided tour!!!
281,4.0,We went at night.  The place was amazing I could spend lots of time just looking at the detail.  This is a very easy walk.
282,5.0,This is a very old palace which was first built more than 600 hundred years ago.  It was a residence for the Korean kings previously.It was destroyed and rebuilt again many times over the years.  The builidngs are empty inside because most of the original furnitures and items were destryoed already.The palace has got very colorful exteriors.  There are many courtyards inside.   Big space and yards.  Lots of tree.Very pleasant to walk around and take some nice photos.
283,5.0,Beautiful and grand palace. Make sure you catch the Changing of the Guards ceremony and take lots of photos! Its culturally rich and very colourful ceremony.
284,5.0,Gorgeously remade castle ruins. The only thing that would make it better would be adding more relics. Armor hanging from the walls? Ancient style outfits in the king's quarters? Such detail ont he roofs. Super beautiful. Seeing the Blue House at the end was a bonus we weren't expecting. It was nice to see the Hanok Village right next door as well.
285,5.0,"The history and culture is rich! I highly recommend a visit here, pack a lunch and make it a picnic! This is a place to enjoy, and take in! I couldn’t spend enough time here if I tried! Also take advantage of the free speaking tours!"
286,4.0,"Enter these walls and you'll find yourself lost in a labyrinth of pathways and structures. And although the expansive grounds seem to extend infinitely toward the mountains as you press deeper and deeper, what remains today is most but not all of the once massive palace grounds that existed in the 15th century (as illustrated by a mural in the palace museum).Built in 1395, this was the Joseon dynasty's most extensive endeavor, an enormous facility on 107 acres with 7,700 rooms (99 acres remain now). This is a stunning relic of the past, a maze of buildings, every turn providing new adventures. I highly recommend this site if you're visiting Seoul."
287,5.0,I’ve loved the experience of wearing a traditional Korean cloth (Hanbok) and walking in the palace. The admission to Gyeongbokgung Palace was free since we were wearing Hanbok. I do encourage people who wants to experience Korean culture to visit the palace. The rental shops are near by the Palace where they offer for men’s and Women’s Korean clothes. There are few coffee shops and gift shops inside. Beside you will be able to see presidential blue palace.
288,4.0,"The area of the palace very large. We were there for 2 hour but not explore all. Enter the palace must pay, but if you wear hanbok (korea traditional clothes) you can enter free). We rental hanbok at LOK GALLERY (picture number 2) the owner very2  patient(you can see from the first picture- wearing black), but my kids rental at different place but the owner was rude(last picture). The first time we go to their place becauce it is in front of the main stret, but after now the owner like that, me, mum and husband looking another place and found LOK GALLERY(from the the gallery i book for my kids just walk forward you can find the LOK GALLERY, located in small stret. At certain time there is performance at a field before enter the palace (at that time i saw at 2 pm), so if you don’t want pay, you can still see the performance. If you want to see the garden and small lake (the view here was good)after enter you can go to left side. Must visit palace if you go to korea."
289,5.0,"GyeongBokGung is absolutely stunning and beautiful! History is alive here and everything has been preserved so well. I'm so happy to see such thriving history and stunning culture of what royal life must have been like to come alive right before my eyes. Everything as soon as you enter the gate, to the changing of the guards, the buildings, and throne room -- ALL is stunning. You don't want to miss this!NOTE: I believe this palace is open everyday for tourism and it's super cheap! I only paid like $2 or $3 dollars and my teenage sister was half price. So this is definitely a lengthy and cheap tour for the whole family! Enjoy!"
290,3.0,"The palace is so much humorous. One the best place to take a picture, you can rent Hanbok dress at the store behind the palace and get free entrance the palace so you don’t have to buy a ticket at front of this place."
291,5.0,"In terms of size and magnificence it's the second best of the 4 palaces in my opinion.  However, this one gets the most tourist because it's right in the middle of the city with a big statue in front of it.  It's the palace of one of the wisest king in Korea who also invented the modern Korean writing script in an attempt to replace the Chinese script.Inside it's beautiful with many places to walk around and enjoy a nice day in the park.  The palaces and buildings, like all other 4 palaces, could be that much better enhanced if they actually placed ancient artifacts/furniture in there instead of a big empty room.  Most of them are locked up..."
292,3.0,Good place to revisit Korean history. Otherwise the place doesn't really have much of other stuff to do.Imperial soldiers will parade the ground every few hours. Great photo-taking opportunity. Otherwise 1 to 2 hours here should be sufficient.
293,4.0,"The main palace in Seoul, located in a straight line with the statue of Admiral Yi Soon Shin, the Great King Sejong, and the Gwanghwamun Gate.You can enter for free when you wear hanbok (Korean traditional costume) which you can rent from places across the palace for around KRW 7,500 to 10,000 for 2 hours, or you can pay KRW 3,000 to enter. The palace is very spacious. At the end there is the throne room which you can see only from outside.Beside the palace, there is an adjacent garden and smaller living quarters. Great for taking pictures and to just absorb the places whete the royal once lived.During certain time, there is a changing guards activities at the main Gwanghwamun Gate."
294,5.0,"This place is huge and a lot of walking.  There was a ceremony for about 10 mins and it was nice.  I don’t know how much would it cost for the entrance, since our tour guide got it for us.  A lot of people, but since the place so big that people were at diff places.  Overall, great place to visit if you’re in Seoul."
