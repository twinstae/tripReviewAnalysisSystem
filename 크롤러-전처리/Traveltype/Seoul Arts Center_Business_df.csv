0,5.0,Beautiful place. Have lots of quality exhibition year around with great restaurants and cafes. Even small Ice Skating rink in the winter months. One stop shopping for your artsy needs. Highly recommend to visit.
1,5.0,"You couldn't luck out much better than to see two exhibitions of the Queen of Art Deco and the Father of Art Nouveau.  Tamara de Lempicka for the first time in Korea, and Alphonse Mucha for the second time here in 3 years.  Both give a great retrospective on the work of the artists, and the Mucha exhibition shows a very surprising angle on the fact that a majority of Japanese Mange Anime is highly influenced by his style and graphics.  All my friends said ""No way!"" but the evidence is irrefutable.  Although the weather in December was not conducive to experience the outside grounds and overall magnitude of this wonderful Center, we loved our experience and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seoul."
