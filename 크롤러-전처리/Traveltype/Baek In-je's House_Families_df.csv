0,5.0,"This museum is for free and should not be overlooked if you are interested in history and culture. For granted, this was inhabited by a very rich person and does not symbolize how ""people lived"" in any way. I could just wander around and let my fantasy roam! I would love to recreate this style and house with its setup and ""live happily ever after"". A real dream home to me! Also you can leave your drink outside in a holder, no one will touch it and you can pick it up when you are done. Eating and drinking inside the museum is not allowed, but they do have a ""drink-guard"" at the entrance ;)"
