The HIGHLIGHTS exhibit was really cool and I took a few pictures. All of the exhibits are free entrance. Some of it, though, don't allow photographs."
1,2.0,"The exterior of the building is interesting. It was the former Supreme court built in 1928. Interior was modern and lovely space. Exhibits were very disappointing. The 3rd floor was completely closed. Maybe they were between exhibitions. 2nd floor had 2 small rooms of paintings. Neither exhibit was interesting to us and was not extensive. we are usually very open to different kinds of art but this really wasn't much. The larger gallery on the 2nd floor was closed as the exhibit ended 2 days earlier.There was absolutely no art outside the 2 small rooms. No art on walls in hallways or public spaces. No sculptures, no nothing. We were so surprised. There was a DreamWorks animation exhibit on the 1st floor. The gift shop consisted solely of DreamWorks products.It was a very disappointing experience."

In other ones I found some beautiful Sindy Shermann, Warholl, Jeff Kunts and lots of talented young artists. The highest level of curating exhibitions here."

There is a dunkin' donuts on the corner, walk past the city hall building and up the walkway when you see the colorful flower exhibit.  The admission is free.  I went because they were having a Universal Studios exhibit.  I can't say that I was that impressed, but if you go with the idea that some stuff is ""off the wall"" you might get a kick out of it.  They have a gift shop with some very interesting items and a cafe combined.  Good for a rainy day."
