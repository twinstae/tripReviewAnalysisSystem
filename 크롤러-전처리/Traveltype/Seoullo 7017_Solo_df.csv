0,4.0,It’s a bit like the NY Highline except more concrete. Nice way to get between areas of the city and avoid the traffic.
1,5.0,"Take the walk at night.  The soft glow of the planters and occasional music along the way are good for the soul, an airborne oasis above the rush of cars and trains. During the days you may come across a player at one of the four or so pianos along the route.  And the blooms are changing every week. Even umbrellas are provided for an oppressive summer sun.  Thoughtful Korean designers at their best. Highly recommended."
2,4.0,"The walkway is not very long but nice, with interesting trees and many pianos, plus a few interesting views."
3,4.0,Calling this an overhead bridge would be a severe understatement! There are tons of plants here with their scientific names and korean names. The view of the city at night wasnt so bad. There are pianos for ppl to use if they wish. The signages are all projected onto the floor which is quite cool. I went in the late evening though it seems like there are afew small activities for people to partake it for a small fee if theg wish but they were all closed when i went. Plenty of ambassadors and security walking around the area.Its lovely but i wouldnt go out of my way to visit it. Only if its nearby or along the way.
4,4.0,"Well, personally I liked this place although many people said this place is not as good as they thought. Just my timing was not good. I visited this place during the Winter over a bad pollution.Surrounded by high buildings,I could imagine visiting this walkpath during the sunset on the Spring with a good weather should become a great view. I can feel the calmness over the hectic korean lifestyle"
5,3.0,"Seoullo 7017 was quite nice once you get up. There's an elevator or you can wind your way up the stairs and get some exercise. There's not much to see except the rail and buildings but it's a nice way to cross the road and offers a great place to sit along with all the trees and ponds up here. There's quite an evident homeless scene underneath as many older Koreans sit by Seoul station but they won't bother you. While here, walk to Lotte Mart which is nearby for an interesting experience in a Korean supermarket."
6,4.0,"It was around 1970 when this elevated road was constructed to connect two sides around Seoul Station. However due to safety issues, the road was closed.After this, rather than tearing down the existing structure, the road was developed into Seoullo 7017, an elevated garden for pedestrians.I visited last April and May during spring time and the trees were in their prime conditions. The walk way is like the condensed version of the Korean forest and flora.I recommend to schedule a visit at around 5 pm until sundown as the views are amazing with the changing sky colors and the sun rays are not too harsh on these times.There is a convenience store in the middle part of the walk way with a viewing deck at the top for better views."
7,5.0,"i was living in Namdaemun so every time i would take the subway or need to do laundry i would have to cross Seoullo and it was always lovely at Christmas they decorate the park and little activity areas, there is also a cafe and lift down to exit 8 of Seoul station"
8,4.0,"This is a welcome walk that now allows to leisurely cross the busy station square. This elevated « green » walk is actually not that green despite the numerous plants that have been planted in concrete structures, but still much much better than anything grey and polluted below. Its was probably difficult to do much better in such environment. It is also a  good opportunity to review your botanical skills as all plants there have a label (in Korean but with Latin names). The most disappointing is the length of this walk, maybe 1 km or so, meaning that you cross it in 15 minutes."
9,4.0,"This is a.new tourist attraction in the center of Seoul.  It used to be an overpass for the motorists but the city govt converted it to a.new pedestrian overpass.Seoullo17 stretches from namdaemun market in hoehyon station up to Malla-dong.  I started my walk in the hoehyon side where the tourist information was located.  Since it used to be a bridge, the walk uphill was a.breeze.  This overpass.was connected to 2 buildings.where the cafes and restaurants including the comfort rooms.are located.  At the center of the overpass, you will have a commanding view of seoul station and the sorrounding areas.  The place has alot of benches, and plant boxes.  Since it was early spring, the plants have not bloomed yet, in fact they are just starting to.plant flowering plants.This overpass had several exits with elevators.  One can easily go to seoul station and the seoul bus transport center.This place is good for walking during spring and autumn but i.doubt during summer and rainy season."
10,5.0,"Seoullo 7017 Sky Garden is the latest landmark that has been added to the bevy of attractive tourists’ sites in Seoul City. I visited a couple of months after it's opening in 2017 and it was as serene as I could imagine.The plants and flowers were green and offered a space to relax, especially if you want to read or sip on your coffee. The views on the highways under the Sky Walkway is also amazing. There are souvenir shops and coffee shops lined on the monument. It is also easier to reach Namdaemun market and Namsan Park. The night views with all the lights are enchanting."
11,4.0,I was in Seoul in Dec and it was very cold. I walked on the bridge Seoullo 7017 from Seoul Station. Sun was setting.
12,4.0,"It's a very new attraction place in Seoul. There are many trees & flowers along the walk way. you can start it around Namdaemun Market or Seoul Station. There are some connecting paths to the major buildings. If you would like to visit in the morning, please come around 07:30 or 08:00 am. If you come later, it's very hot. But if you would like to find sme coffee/ snacks/ food to eat, the shops there will open around 10:30 - 11:00 am. For me, I love to visit at night time (after 19:30 pm.)  to see some beautiful lights."
13,3.0,"I was looking forward to this, to see the hype that surrounded this. To my dismay, it is like another linkway above the busy roads of Seoul Station. I guess it would be best to see during Spring where the trees and flowers are in full bloom. The stems of plants are bare as its winter now. What i do like is that there are speakers with sounds of nature being fed in."
14,3.0,"Seoullo 2017 is directly connected to Seoul Station. There wasn't much stuff to see in the day, so I'd recommend to visit at night when the walkway is lit up."
15,5.0,"Rather like the Highline in New York City, this is a derelict flyover that's been converted into a modern, fun place to stroll above the city traffic. Lots of places to sit and people watch, amongst the trees, lotus ponds, shrubs and look out points. Free to wander and well worth the climb."
16,3.0,"It is an interesting and creative idea to develop a pedestrian like this. But, in my opinion, around Seoullo 7017 needs to be developed both for visitors of the city and the citizens."
17,4.0,"Gives you a good look and feel of the city, while still being perfectly safe.  It's a disused road that's turned into an urban walkway.  Nice nature and peaceful to sit. Extends from myeongdong to seoul station"
18,5.0,Love this place so much. I started my walk from the Seoul Station (exit at the Airport Rail). Really loved the views from the walkway at night. Don't forget to also detour right after the Seoullo Terrace (towards the Hilton and Seven Lucky Casino) and you will be at the part of the city wall. Very beautiful location from up there. You can see the Namsan Tower and skyline.Really recommended.
19,4.0,"I especially like the different kind of roses exposed, it is quite small but it is beautiful. You can enjoy a nice walk there."
