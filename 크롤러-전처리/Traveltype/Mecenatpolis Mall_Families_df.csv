0,2.0,"Our reason for visiting this mall was to see a place called Liliput which is supposedly great for young kids and toddlers with lots of things to do and food etc. However, aside from what we considered an unreasonable price, we found it far from interesting.The mall itself is depressing, lots of concrete and a few interesting stores and eat places but really depressing. It reminded me of old council flats built in the 1960's back in the UK.It's saving grace I suppose are the colourful umbrellas suspended everywhere that at least gives the place some colour. However, what added to our poor impression of this mall is that there were very few people here, even at lunchtime."

The only place with a handful of shoppers was the supermarket at the basement level. Yet, because it is a mega mart, the supermarket looks desolate too."
