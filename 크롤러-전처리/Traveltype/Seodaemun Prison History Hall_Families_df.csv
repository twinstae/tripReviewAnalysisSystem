It was not just empty rooms but displays and explanations of what each room and each building represented during its active days. Huge place as well. It shows how it was before, and the struggle by Koreans just to gain independence.  This is one attraction that helps explain why South Koreans are very nationalistic and very proud of their independence."
1,5.0,Visit with a local or a guide to better understand the history behind the prison hall. We were fortunate to tour the place with Luke from Meteor Youth Voluntary Club. He was well versed with the history and walked us through the exhibits providing interesting information and anecdotes of the famous prisoners incarcerated there. A solemn place indeed makes one marvel again at human courage and self sacrifice of these individuals.
2,5.0,"Easy access-right off of Dongnimun subway stop. Brought my teenage son so he could get a sense of the Japanese occupation and the Korean resistance movement.  We had visited the Seoul Museum of History the day before, but the Seodaemun Prison History Hall truly brought the content alive.  There’s no comparison to walking the actual grounds where political prisoners were once held. As others have commented, I only wish more of the exhibits were translated to English.  Also I noticed there were tributes to student/worker/pro democracy activists, but they were only in Korean, and I wish I could’ve understood what they said."
3,3.0,"Visiting on a very cold winter day, it was a very sombre place that outlines the history of the Japanese rule over Korea. Womens underground prison was interesting and the details that keep the memory of the suffering alive are interesting. Not the best English translations, but you get the general idea in the selection of exhibits and information on display. The metal die casts of feet; photography images and small artifacts paint a sad picture of the unsettled time in Korean history. We visited while half the place was out of bounds due to a festival rehearsal, but the stunning voices of the opera singers throughout the dreary halls of prison cells seemed fitting somehow and made the experience better! Subway station directly at the main gate; basic toilet facilities and a small souvenir shop. Not the best museum in the city but definitely worth a visit."
4,4.0,"I have been to Korea so many times, we hit all the top tourist places...decided to check this out with my son. It was a bit chilling knowing all the suffering that took place...not only at the hands of the Japanese, which was absolutely atrocious...but also at the hands of the various Korean governments which was just as bad. It was sad thinking back to the suffering of the Korean people had to endure throughout history...recommended to understand Korean history better."
5,4.0,"It feels like going back and living in the past. It was -4 degrees Celsius when we visited,  I can feel how cold or how hot it will be to be in one of the narrow prison cells.Passing through the torture room was spine chilling/hair raising. It was sad to know the human cruelty experienced during war. I admired Koreans for the bravery and for the love of their country.We were amazed by how the prison building and other things during the war was well preserved. Walking distance from subway station Dongnimmun St. Exit 5, A map guide to the prison history hall.Before exiting the Prison History hall, there is a souvenir shop near the rest room and the exit gate.Not all information are translated in English :("
6,5.0,"We visited this early in the morning with at least two school groups.  The prison was well preserved and all the placards had very good English explanations.  It took us about 2 hours to walk through.  I found it a sad history and interesting insight into the way the Japanese attempted to suppress the spirit of the Korean people.  The school groups were fun to watch as the engaged with the various exhibits.  Go, it helps to tie the occupational history to the Korean War and see the beginnings of separate states."
7,5.0,"This place most certainly reached my expectations.The entrance to Seodaemun Prison Hall starts off with some background information. The entire area itself is large with several of buildings to visit. After the entrance building is where all the creepiness begins. I felt myself shiver as I walked through the other buildings. I recall seeing an entire row of cells and the silence adds up to the creepiness. There's also a hospital, memorial hall, and work out area that was all part of the history. There were also hand prints and image of each of the deceased. Along with feeling scared, was also a wave of sadness. You get to read personal notes written by those held captive which truly gives you an insight of the horrors. There are some small clips that briefly summarize the horrors. I absolutely loved this place. It's like watching an incredible historical bloody movie. Scary but intriguing. Not recommended to those with the faintest heart."

9,4.0,"My trip to Korea doesn’t stop at garden, villages and good food. I took a detour to a prison in Seoul. This is Seodaemun prison, among the largest prison in Seoul in the past era, when South Korea is still under Japanese colonization. You can’t get too excited on the main gates. It has a watch tower, lovely red bricks wall and a metal. That is about it. Let’s go in, I am sure there are “nostalgic” stuff within. Visitors are immediately greeted with some of the tools used for locking up prisoners. The next section bring us to some interrogation chamber, torture chambers where we witness how Japanese forcing the prisoners or detainee to admit wrong-doing that they didn’t commit. I move on to visit the actual cell where prisoners kept. The classic scary element is there - long aisle, dim interior, and the metal clanking noise upon door swinging open. Many people died here. The atmosphere may be calm and peace, but we are constantly reminded of the remaining lingering soul and ghost."
10,4.0,"Strongly recommend for people who likes to understand more about the history, the experience of the previous generation.Fairly interesting place which takes you to a tour of a full fledged prison however, most of the explanation are in Korean. If possible get a translator, otherwise it is just moving around and seeing. Please do not miss out on the execution house!"
11,4.0,"Well organised attraction. I was a little disappointed in the gift shop, but otherwise no complaints."
12,4.0,"Want to understand what older Koreans have against the Japanese? Pay a visit to this well-explained prison museum. Disturbing at times, but always moving, the museum compares itself to other memorials to human suffering such as Auschwitz and the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam. As long as you're interested in history, you can easily spend a couple hours touring the grounds and exhibits. I would be careful about bringing small children, though. Some of the exhibits include instruments of torture. And one of the restored jail cells has an audio recording of a prisoner pleading to be let out."
13,4.0,"This a prison built during the Japanese occupation in 1907 to house political prisoners, men, women and even juveniles arrested for resisting Japan's colonial occupation. After the liberation of 1945 it continued to house prisoners until it was finally closed in 1987.  Since much of it was dismantled before being turned into a history museum, some of it has actually been rebuilt. The main prison hall, workshops, and execution building however are the intact original, and stand as an eerie reminder of Korea's unfortunate history. The museum displays instruments of torture, photographs taken of prisoners, and you can enter solitary confinement cells to get a glimpse of how harrowing it must have been for those who suffered. LCD screens give eye witness accounts from actual survivors. Elderly men and women still bearing physical and emotional scars, describe the brutality they endured as prisoners. Although the narrative is soaked in Korean nationalism, the overriding theme is that the museum should serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made by independence activists, and it does. The tour takes about 2 hours. If poignant and sombre history is something you like to take in, then it is worthwhile. It only costs a few dollars, and afterwards you can take short taxi or bus ride to Shinchon, where you can find great places to eat, street food, arty cafes and shopping."
14,4.0,"I stumbled upon this place by reading an article about Seodaemun, one of the former eight gates of Seoul. Instead of finding a gate, the searches led me to the Seodaemun Independence Park with Seodaemun Prison as its signature attraction. Instad of going alone, I invited friends who wanted a “Seoul Tour”.Getting there from Nambu Bus Terminal is very simple, and finding the entrance to the prison is very easy. Asking someone, “hey do want to go to prison with me” was the most difficult part until I explained the details of the journey. The prison hasn’t been actively used as it’s original function for a few decades and serves as a very interesting museum. After purchasing a ticket,  we were guided to the first exhibit hall that explains the history and gruesome details of the various functions this place has served as besides being a Korean jail. There are guides who speak English that will explain everything for you. The first building has both upper and lower levels you need to see.Inside the first building on the upper level, there are art exhibits with pictures of the prisoners (both men and women), videos and other historical items (shackles, documents) present. The basement area has the more graphic scenes. We walked through what the interrogation rooms and cells looked like. We got to peek through and catch glimpses of wax figures depicting scenes of what happened in each room. Further into the basement is the hotbox and solitary confinement cells in which we were able to cram ourselves into. We shackled up with props provided and took a lot of funny pictures with other vistors.There is also another building representing a large area of cells. It starts with a processing room and leads further down a long hallway. Some rooms are locked in with wax figures and others are open. We locked ourselves in a few for fun to see what it was like (since we aren’t criminals).Afterwards, there is a large courtyard for the kids to run around in conjunction with Independence Park. We decided to head back to Myeongdong for lunch. There are many other features located in the area, like one of many entrances to the nearby hiking trail, but we were too hungry.To get to this area from Nambu Bus Terminal or any place in Seoul, connect to the #3 subway line heading for Daehwa. Get off at Dongnimun station (326). Leave the station from exit 5 and there will be a sign for Seodaemun Prison in with 10 meters of the exit. Follow the signs up the narrow path up the hill to the main entrance. The cost is 3,000 won for adults and 1,500-2,000 won for kids (sorry, I don’t have any)."
