0,3.0,"I visited this place as my hotel is nearby. Else I will not make it in my itinerary. It was once the house of Heungseon Daewongun, the father of King Gojong. Despite its location in the middle of the city, this compound remains peaceful and quiet. It is a small complex, with a few traditional buildings. 20 mins is sufficient to briefly explore this place. Free admission, closed on Monday."
1,3.0,"Go to Anguk station, it just 3 minutes walking distance from the station. The entrance is free. Please see pictures below for their opening time. It's a small and cozy palace."
2,5.0,"This place used to be a home of Gojong, 26th King of Joseon Dynasty in the late 19th century and was the house of his father, Heungseon Daewongun, who actually ran the country when the king was too young to rule.This is a small place. Nothing much going on (except some events on weekends). But that's probably the reason you would need this place, where is so quiet and restful in the right middle of the big city. Plus, free admission."
3,3.0,"My first experience of Korean history. It's a nice little palace which has been wrll naintained/restored and which is of interesting design. Some rooms contain some pictoral or other represenntation of the period, which makes it a bit more interesting. Its free so easy to pop in and see when visiting grander nearby palaces. Not in the top flight of palces but worth a visit."
4,4.0,"You can walk around and peek inside the traditional buildings and walk on the grounds.  Itâ€™s close to the metro and best of all, there is no entrance fee.  Suggest visiting when you go see the main attractions in the area including Insadong neighbourhood.On the occasion I visited, it was a fall festival with games, music and traditional dancing."
5,3.0,"This is a small replica of a small palace that once stood here. It's completely free to visit and you do actually get what you pay for. Not much. It's interesting enough and there is a small museum on site, but otherwise, it's just a collection of buildings that you cannot enter. Some are open to view from the door, but not many."
6,3.0,"It's a small Royal Residence near Insadong & Bukchon Hanok Village. If you have time, please visit this one. There are some mock up figures to present the Royal Culture & Ceremony. It's very popular for Koreans to spend time with families. Sometimes you will see the Pre-Wedding shooting and also set up a Wedding Ceremony there."
7,4.0,"The staff of tourist information said this is the smallest palace. I visited this palace and probably she was right, this is a little palace but interesting. Very clean & you can learn about history of Korea, the king's family and the knights. And if you like about architecture, this palace also worth to visit. Free entrance and just 5 minutes walk by foot from Insadong."
8,4.0,This home is a good place to see how the yangban (noble) class is lived. The place is surprisingly quiet considering its historic significance and convenient location to Jongymo Shrine. Nice architecture with some English explanations in the small museum.
9,4.0,Unhyeongung is small and simple. It's not as popular as the other palaces that is why it is more intimate and you can have a closer look at the rooms and features of the building. Less tourists come here especially in the morning so you can take pictures without distractions. There is hanbok rental here as well. It is a few minutes walk form Anguk station and it's free admission.
10,3.0,The palace is quite small. After 1 hour you saw everything there is. Eventhough it's not as impressive as other palaces it showes better than the other ones how people lived in the palace. If you're interested in that you should visit this place otherwise i recommend it just when you're in the neighbourhood anyway.
11,4.0,Small and quiet location - not flooded with bus loads of tourists.  It gives you a chance to closely look at the architecture and appreciate the site.  Not as flash as the bigger locations but it has a different purpose and does it well.
12,5.0,"Free, open till late and easy to find in the Insadong area this palace is a real treasure.  Pick up a leaflet at the entrance and you can guide your self around in less than an hour.  For me the real charm of the palace was the recreation in all the rooms of what life was like, with costumed models, furniture etc etc. Quiet and peaceful this museum was near the top of my Seoul experiences"
13,3.0,"I visited ""Unhyeongung"" for 3 reasons:I was in the area already.I was passing it to get to the Bukchon Hanok Village.It is Free to get in, so I had nothing to lose.It is an interesting 'Palace', although it's not officially one as it was never lived in by a King, but very plain compared to the other brightly decorated palaces in Seoul (which are stunning).  It is quite tranquil and nice to walk around, and there are some interesting models and exhibits, but you will only need an hour there maximum.Go in if you are passing but don't make a special trip just for this as there are better things to see."
14,5.0,"This palace is highly underrated. It may not have the glitz and glam the bigger palaces have as it is mostly plain wood (not decorated and painted like the other palaces), but it is magnificent.  The volunteer at the gate was so excited that I was there.  She came out and explained the significance of each hall of the palace.Some of the rooms had mock displays of what the rooms would have been like when it was inhabited, which I absolutely loved.  At the other palaces I visited most of the rooms were empty (except for the King's ""office"" as it was explained to me).  This gave me a better understanding of the culture during the time period."
