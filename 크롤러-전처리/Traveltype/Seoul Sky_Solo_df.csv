4,5.0,"It’s the tallest building in Korea and it really have a beautiful observation deck. It’s at the TOP and even got outdoor deck to take photos. It’s very windy and cold out there though. There are a lot of tourists, so choose to go early in the morning.People stuck at the lower floor to take photo. Try to go to upper floor to take photos as less people. It’s very easy to go as Long as you follow the sign from the subway station."
5,5.0,"Impressively tall building. I bought the ticket at the desk, no queues. I paid extra for the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor (unsurprisingly!) Worth the extra as it covers the cost of a beer and the views are amazing. It has a glass floor section of course and it’s always amusing to see the less intrepid tip-toe onto it. If you like tall buildings, this has to be on the list."
6,4.0,Went in the evening of a clear day and the views were very impressive. Elevator was rapid and there's multiple floors so not very crowded. Took the time to enjoy the view and take pictures with my new camera.
7,5.0,"The 5th tallest building in the world.. world's fastest double decker elevator.. tallest building in South Korea.. whether day or night, spring summer fall or winter it's worth the experience to go here. Consists of 123 floors and the glass observatory is located on the 117th to 123rd floor. You'll see a 360 degrees panoramic view of the entire Seoul city. Plus it will only take you 1 minute from the basement to the observatory."
8,4.0,"Before getting to Seoul, I was searching interesting places in the Internet. There were a lot of, but I was about to go somewhere I’ve never been to. So I decided it will be Lotte Tower, because it was the nearest place to Gangnam-where my apartments were. My first goal in Seoul was watchin’ the city and in the morning I was at language school. That’s why I didn’t have much time for attractions. The day before my last day in Seoul I finally planned to go to observation desk. It was easy to got there by subway and fast indeed. I think it’s the cheapest way, except going by foot.When you are in the station it seems to you that it’s an another world. Awesome walls, everything is so colorful, like you are in the fairy tale, but I had to follow the indexes to find Tower. Staff is able to speak English, they could help you to find ticket window or anything else. The price of my ticket was about 27$. In few minutes I was getting up to 118th floor by sky shuttle. Then you can go up to the 120th floor to terrace(there were freezing because of wind).In the 118th there is a transparent part of floor and and if you were getting close to the floor you’ll see some different parts of the city.By chance, I fortunately saw the sunset and it was really breathtakingly. So I didn’t regret that I had got to there."
9,5.0,"Being 500 meters up is not something you do every day. you can selfie yourself to death, on 121, 122 and 124 floor and have a great coffee at the upper-level lounge.  come before sunset and enjoy day, sunset and night time up in the air."

12,5.0,"Take metro to Jamsil station (metro line 2 or 8)  Buy tickets to the observatory deck at B2. Wasn't crowded on a weekday. 27,000 won for adults (ages 13 and up), 24000 won for children. The observatory deck offers an unparalleled 360-degree view of Seoul. Would prefer this to N Seoul Tower anyday."
13,5.0,Breathtaking views of seoul. Fifth tallest building in the world. Enjoy a beer and a snack on the 123rd floor. This was my second time in Korea and the second time i went up to the top of seoul sky building. Its truly breathtaking.
14,5.0,"The entrance and ticket windows are located inside of Lotte World department store. I got there in the afternoon, around 1 pm. There was no lines. Everything looked very well organized. It is worth the price of admission. The views are gorgeous.The glass is relatively clean, it is easy to make a good quality photo through the glass. I am attaching few of my photos as an example. The deck itself has 3 levels. It was not crowded. There were people around of course, but there was enough space to quietly enjoy the views and to take pictures without being disturbed. There is a souvenir shop on the top and also another one on the ground when you exit. There is a snack shop on the top as well. There is Godiva coffee shop on the store floor opposite to the ticket counter. I can highly recommend their chocolate ice cream. So tasty!All in all I can recommend a visit. It was money well spent. Just make sure the weather is nice and sunny before boarding the metro train to Seoul Sky."
15,5.0,"Seoul Sky is the tallest building in Seoul. You can see the great scenery of Seoul for 360 degree. If the weather is so great, you also can see it far to Songdo, Incheon City. The ticket is not cheap. So please check at the board in front of ticket booth downstairs to make sure that how many buildings/ landmark that you can see during the period you visit. Ps. It's not OK if you see a lot of ""X"" marks on the board."
16,5.0,"It is best to go up around an hour before sunset to get to see the great view from late afternoon, dusk to evening with all the lights around the Jamsil area."
17,5.0,"For ""can't beat it"" views from the top of the country's tallest tower (Lotte Tower), this is the place. Yes, it is pricey ($25 US approx) but we enjoyed it nonetheless. You get your photo taken before the elevator and then you can see it and but it up top. Good for families."
18,5.0,"Wonderful and a must visit place How to reach there: get down Jamsil  station on line 2 or 8 and take exit 1 or 2 where you will see Lotte mall. It’s just to the right of this enterance.Tickets cost: 27000 won for adultsFast track tickets: 50000 won for someone who is in a hurry and has limited timeIdeal time to reach there: around 4 pm so that even if there is long queue you would be up by 5 pm and can enjoy both the daylight and nighttime view of cityTips: don’t carry liquid / eatables as they are not allowedNeither are lighters and petsIt’s the world’s highest sky observation desk, world’s third highest observation desk and world’s fifth tallest building.A must visit place when in Seoul."
19,5.0,"Seoul sky is above the Lotte World Mall and next to the Lotte World at the Jamsil Station.IT is made up of a few levels. level 117 is the observation deck. 118 is the glass floor where you can see all the way down to the ground. A outdoor viewing platform and also 2 cafes and souvenir shops at the above levels. Finally a premium lounge on the top.You can stay up there as long as you wish. But their coffee and cakes seem to be selling really fast, better have a meal first before go up there.They will also scan your belongings before you are allowed to go up there, like what they did at the airport.Best time to visit is around sunset and nighfall"
