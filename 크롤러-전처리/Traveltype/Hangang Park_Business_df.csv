0,5.0,"Everyone loves the Han River - walkers, joggers, people doing exercise, grannies having dance parties, kite flyers, families having picnics, friends drinking beer, fishermen, swimmers, wildlife photographers, casual cyclists and racing cyclists. Itâ€™s an amazing fun atmosphere ... and a little crazy.  I have visited in October and July. July was hot so early mornings and nights were when it came alive. Along the way are steer markets and chicken shacks. Made a work trip into a little vacation as well. So much fun!"
1,4.0,"My friend wanted to rent bikes to ride along the river but it was so cold we just walked. Very well maintained, with convenience stores along the way for snacks."
2,4.0,"I rented a bike and biked along the river for many miles. During the weekend, the place is very  poplar with walkers and cyclists. The view is nice. The bike path is very well maintained. Lots of stops to rest and take pictures."
3,5.0,I went for bike ride here on my last trip..great way to spend a secret afternoon off from the office!
4,5.0,Fall and Spring are excellent times to visit this enormous park. Check out the different options depending on where you go. Both sides of the river are wide green spaces even though there is always a freeway nearby. Seoul has done an amazing job at assuring that the river front is a relaxing place. Bike paths are every way and a separate walking/hiking trail is available. If you a bit outside of the main city center you will find some well restored natural parts for bird watching and a sense of wilderness which is hard to come by in this city.
5,3.0,"Compared to other parks in other major cities, there's nothing special about Hangang Park. It looks plain and the view of Han River does not seem to look spectacular from the park. I did a 12km loop by the river bank and the flat route was pretty much the same."
6,4.0,This is a great way to relax or take in a breath of fresh air after Seoul's city sights and shopping.
7,5.0,"Nice place to walk around and relax, great view. This place is great for outdoors activities and play around."
8,5.0,"Walking, bike riding, enjoying the Korean sunrises and sunsets- this was the best place to do this! There are work out stations every mile or so- and the scenery and river are incredible."
9,4.0,"Nice place to escape the heat, sit by the river and people watch. Around sunset there is a fountain show from the bridge set to music. Locals gather here, order takeout and set up tents and picnics for the evening. Would have been great to rent a bike and cycle around the area. The floating island buildings are nearby for touristy type food, otherwise they quite vacuous inside with not much to offer. They are nicely lit at night and make a nice photo backdrop."
10,3.0,Its a really nice place by the Han river just to hang out with friends in the evening. Carry a picnic basket and a mat to sit int he park.
11,4.0,"We took a han river cruise for sightseeing and It was awesome. Seoul is amazing city to see the new and old culture at the same time. I was shocked how they developed their own city after Korean War and this area, definitely, you can feel the new Seoul as it-self."
12,3.0,I enjoyed strolling by the river. It seemed to be exclusively locals enjoying picnics and families and couples out for the day. The views of the skyline in the distance were extraordinary. It looked like CGI from a Sci-Fi film! I also liked watching people paddle the little duck and chicken boats.
13,5.0,"It was a crowded place and the lane was a bit narrow though however my wife and I had great fun cycling on tandem bike.. It was a bit chill but the view was good enough for me ...this was where the block buster movie ""the host"" was shots...so its kind of nice to be in the film site....it was clean and well maintained but again too crowded..."
14,4.0,"The park is stunning at night, you can see the rainbow water from the bridge which is stunning.  Sometime there is a free concerts at night which is also fun.  There are 2 hugh resturants complex which you can enjoy various foods.  Great to spend time watching the lights of the buidlings too.. Stunning !"
15,5.0,"The best thing about Seoul is it has free, beautiful, well maintained river parks along the Han river. It is like the Malecon for Cubans for people in Seoul. You will see many chilling under shades, playing sports and riding bicycles. Stroll around and blend in."
16,5.0,"Walking along the Han River in Hangang Park is the quintessential Seoul experience and the best way to see the city. Sure, it's not a clean river, but walking or biking along the river offers some of the best views of the city besides Namsam."
17,4.0,"A short walk from the buzz of Garuso-gil. Great place for a picnic or just sit and enjoy the vistas along the Han River. There are quite a few floating restaurants which make for popular haunts for night dining.It's not a ""pretty"" park with ornate, manicured gardens. But nonetheless a nice respite from the traffic.A popular bike trail stretches along the river. Great place to people-watch!"
18,4.0,Cherry blossoms are everywhere and on most streets but are concentrated around here. Locals flock here for picnics and to camp. Worth a visit!
19,3.0,Day or night the view is quite nice and the bike and walking paths are well maintained. There isn't much else to it other than that. I've enjoyed the park as a daily place for walking during an extended stay but I'm not sure I would make it a tourist destination during a trip.
20,3.0,"there are several Hangang parks along the Hnagang so you have many choices in both north and south side of the river.Parks are well made in terms of location and environment but parking is not free anymore and it is hard to access without a car.Bicycle trails and walking trails are good but food stands are very annoying with trash problems.On sunny day, this is a good place to go and relax and perhaps some exercise will make you feel better.Only the problem is the adjacent roads (88), it is very noisy and the air quality is not great, so mindful about that."
21,4.0,"a refreshing oasis admits the hustle and bustle of Seoul.  The efforts of the Seoul,metropolitan government in keeping this waterway clean is definitely obvious and appreciated."
22,4.0,This park is between a Highway and a river. Not really calm because of the Highway. But to have a calmer walk this could be a good place. I have enjoy it. At the end of the park you will find the National cemetery that is impressive
23,4.0,More water than Ive seen in Beijing for a long time. Rent a bike and check out the nice bridge design. Lots of 7-11 stores along the bike path to get some snacks and fluid.
24,4.0,Got here at about 12am on a rainy July night. We were out at meetings the whole day and by the time I got back to the Hotel it was well past 10pm... I had 3 days in Seoul and wanted to maximise on what could be seenThere is a covenience store on the banks of the Han river (Han - the river name Gang - the word for river)Found open wifi too - IPTIME and spent some time talking to folks back homeThe views across the river (on to the North banks (NSould Tower etc)) were beautiful
25,5.0,I love visiting this park for picnics or just going for bike rides along the river. You can rent bikes at various places and get refreshments at various stores dotted along the river on both sides. Its a great summer's day hangout spot.
26,5.0,"I've been so lucky to be in Seoul during the lantern festival and it has been a treat. In the night all this colourful walk ( little chilly but charming), we were all excited like children.. great"
27,5.0,The hangang park is beautifully made and is extremely clean and well maintained. It has a lot of people cycling around and strolling to enjoy the evening.
28,5.0,"a lovely place for walking & visiting at first introduce with Korea (Seoul). There are a lot of interesting sights at park such as Banpo bridge, floating island, cruise trip along the river Hangang & so on."
29,5.0,"The park was very clean and the walkways level and even for runners / bikers. They had separate sidewalks for pedestrians. At points, there were fountains and water features and other whimsical art works for children.. It stretched for miles along the waterfront."
