0,3.0,"I am, I admit, pretty experienced in comedy so it takes more to impress me.  This was not it, not even close.  I never laughed, perhaps smiled 2-3 times at the slapstick.   The percussion was more entertaining, though nothing to match the level of pro percussive shows like Stomp or Bring in da noise as some reviewers suggest.   As noted, almost nothing is spoken so language is not an issue.    If you pay for VIP, about 8 people will get called on stage to participate, otherwise the lower cost balcony seats are a much better buy.   The comedy is more on the level of small kids, who seemed to enjoy it."

You will enjoy it.Hongdae Nanta theater is a small cozy theater with friendly staff.I did not book ticket in advance and pop in 1 hr before the show. Lucky me still managed to get a ticket. The friend staff helped me to choose the best seat from the remaining available tickets.There were street foods and restaurants outside the theater for quick bites or a proper meal before or after the show. The theater is not too far away from Hongik University station exit 9."
