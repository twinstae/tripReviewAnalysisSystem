Nice to browse or shop if you like that. There is also a level with restaurants but we skipped those and went to the cafe serving rainbow cake. We ordered two smoothies and a rainbow cake with cream plus a red velvet cake with cream cheese. SO DELICIOUS. Massive, and yet I ate the whole thing. The smoothies were also very tasty and not sickeningly sweet so went well with the cake."
1,3.0,Small amount of stores and cafes to visit. This place is more for photos in front of the containers. I wouldn't make it a priority to do.If you do visit make sure you have some other plans within the area doesn't take too long to go through every there.
2,3.0,"I think people just come here to take a picture at the blue parking lot. I did that too. There are many small stores inside, you can buy some korean clothing & accessories. On the first floor I saw many streetwear. However, I feel like most of the people are outside on the parking lot, busy taking pictures. If you want that cool pic on instagram, you’d better come here early."
3,3.0,"Nothing fancy for us, just our own opinion. This is a place just for photo taking only. Can visit if got extra time during visit in Seoul."
4,2.0,Not a big place. Apparels sold here are on the high side and you can get them elsewhere. A good place for photo taking. You can give this place a miss if you don’t have time.

6,3.0,Just another shopping mall...but it has a cool exterior made of shipping containers...has some good spots ro dine and drink
7,3.0,"It is quite a cool concept for young crowd’s hangout space, made entirely from containers, with shops on the first & second floor and restaurants on the top outdoor floor. The exhibition space and music event on the ground level, saw a beer week event with singers and lots of street food joints around the stage area. To be honest, it’s not too worth it to go if you have not much time because it’s quite faraway from the center."
8,4.0,"If you've been to Seoul many times and are in desperate need to find some new spots in town, this is it. It opened in 2015 and is relatively new. There are fashion and lifestyle stores inside, with a couple cafe (try Dore Dore's rainbow cake for instagram fans) and restaurants. The food trucks are also popular. We were there during the sale season and I won't say the clothes here are any more expensive than Aland and the like. But the place is really small and whether it's worth making a trip there is up for discussion... There aren't anything interesting nearby."
9,4.0,Some of this place looks like an unkempt backyard and some of it is very stylish and trendy.  Lots of the food places were just opening so the staff could not be bothered with us.  The best place to grab a coffee and cake is the colourful Dore-Dore.  This is a good place to take pictures of the very odd surroundings. Worth the visit!  Look out for the astronaut!
10,4.0,"many local shops, for teenager and young adults. many cafes too, great place to hangout with friends and taking pictures"
11,3.0,"Not a huge place but accessible via the metro. The cafes and food are on the 3rd floor so don't miss that. Some unique shops but prices are higher than normal, so only buy the more unique stuffs and NEVER the common brands."
12,4.0,The building is made from containers. There are many shops selling fashion cloths. The cloths sold are different from other places. There is a outdoor cafe in the middle and you will find many people taking photos here.The place is easy to find and about 5 minutes walk from the station.
13,5.0,"Once you are here, you will me mesmerized by the blue container structure of the place. Its not really a shopping mall, just a common ground for retail shops within a few containers, which is a great idea. There are many places for you to take that perfect instagram photo.Take the train to konkuk University station and walk straight for about 5 mins to reach.There are many interesting retails shops and it mainly caters to the younger generations. There are also many restaurants at the roof top and a Seoul truck full of full in the middle. I will let my pictures do the talking."
14,5.0,come here if you want to see upcoming new designers showcasing their designs. buy them before they become uber famous. one day you will find them in upscale shopping areas. great place to chillax.
