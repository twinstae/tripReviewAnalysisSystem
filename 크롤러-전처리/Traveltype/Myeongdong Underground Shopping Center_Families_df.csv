0,5.0,We did a little shopping here like beauty products and travel luggage for it is much cheaper here than in the street shops. They also have atm machines here if you are short of cash like we did. We also bought our souvenirs here for gifts back home. A lot of different items to choose from.
1,3.0,We heard about the station actually having retail outlets within the station vicinity (i.e. in the basement area before you emerge from the underground before hitting the street level) There is a treasure trove of about 4-5 shops selling different K-pop merchandise which explains the buzz of activity throughout the day at this station.  My kids spent over an hour poring over all the merchandise on display. The other shops in the station also sell souvenirs but Iâ€™d advise you to explore the shops and pop up carts at street level (and that goes for k pop merchandise as well) before deciding what to purchase)

3,4.0,"The underground shop is huge! Many shops selling apparels, souvenirs and lots more. Its like 1 stop for everything. Great experience."
4,3.0,"This is not a big underground mall. But it has the most kpop retail shops. All sorts of items related to kpop music or drama, you can find it here. Although it is not as big as GOTO mall or Bupyeong Mall, but it has its unique taste too. The famous custard puff is located inside too. Its not too bad after all."
