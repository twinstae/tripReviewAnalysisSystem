0,4.0,"So many choices!!! It feels so asian when you arrive because of all the owners convincing you to buy at their stall! You have to bargain for a good price and afterwards a lady escorts you to their restaurant where they prepare the fish and seafood you just bought! Steamed, bbqed, everything is possible. With soju its a happy feast!"
1,5.0,"I have seen similar places in Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but this is top on the list if you are interested in live seafood (or sea creatures) - from tank to table. Not pleasant sight for vegetarians - be warned. Highly recommended are crabs and cuttlefish. You would also struggle to find bigger and fresher tuna elsewhere. Don‚Äôt expect however to find live prawns (though they are common in HK and Spore). Price is reasonable - perhaps 20-30% below HK and Spore prices - Apple with Apple comparisons."
2,3.0,"Just want to prep those visiting this place. We went to this market given the high review on the freshness. The food that we bought from the whole market were indeed very fresh and not too expensive. We paid for the cockles, abalone, prawn and fish.  After choosing, we were told that the price for cooking is Won 8,000 per kg for BBQ or steaming, preparing the sashimi is FOC. So we happily sat down on level 2 at the ‚Äòdesignated‚Äô area.We bought:Cockle - 1 kg at Won 10,000Sole fish - Won 32,000Abalone - Won 18,000Prawn - Won 10,000Oyster - Won 8,000The waitress took our instruction on how we want to cook the food. We bought tempura and fried small crabs. It was yummy! The cooked food turned out to be really delicious.So here comes the best part. For cooking up the food, the fee:BBQ fish (half) - Won 8,000BBQ abalone - Won 8,000Steam fish (half) - Won 8,000Sashimi handling - Won 8,000Abalone handling - Won 5,000Frying chilli cockle - Won 20,000Service fee - Won4,000 x 8 = 32,000We were quite surprised that what we were told by the wholesaler is different from the restaurant. In fact, the cooking fee cost more than the food itself! In any case, we told the restaurant we will only paid what we were told. We said to the restaurant that charges should be clearly informed to consumer so to avoid any misunderstanding. Instead of gracefully admit the mistakes, she said ‚ÄúÊ≤°ÂÖ≥Á≥ªÔºåËøò‰ºöÊúâÂà´ÁöÑX ÊóÖÂÆ¢‚Äú patronising... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
3,3.0,"Lots of stalls offering the same seafood. We bought about 2kg King Crab and a 2kg Lobster + a few freebies (few prawns and oysters) that costed about krw170k which I don‚Äôt think is cheap compared to where I came from where seafood is imported. However, these are fresh and therefore delicious.Do note though, the price of cooking these at the 2nd floor is not cheap either. It costs me about krw100k. Cooking goes by a fix krw4k/pax cover charge and krw8k/kg cooking charge and additional charge for rice, drinks & etc.To conclude, you can go for the experience if you don‚Äôt mind spending. If not, you can spend this money somewhere else."
4,5.0,"The best place to get seafood in Seoul. The fish stall are linked to the restaurant, so Khuan need to select and they will cook for you. A bit pricey but the king crab is worth the price. A heartfelt meal for the whole family."
5,4.0,The lady that sealling the fresh seafood was very friendly and give us advise on the seafood that we chose. And the price is reasonable too.But be careful of the restaurant you going to choose.they will charge you the price very high..that what happend to us.
6,4.0,"There were plenty of seafood, it was very interesting we went round and round the market. King Crabs are a common sight.. Fresh Fish if you want it sashimi style. We check the price, it was very costly. They have different layers of pricing like buying the fresh seafood price. They lead you to the Restaurant upstairs, There is a surcharging of per dish fee, tea fee, side dish fee, per head fee before you sit down. In the end, we decide not  to have dinner there. But it is a good visit, I get to see new seafood that I never seen before."
7,5.0,"My daughter and I visited this place because we wanted to get fresh seafood, and true enough this was the perfect place. There are fresh seafood vendors inside and outside and we opted to just eat fresh sushi but there are fresh seafood inside where you can purchase and take to the restaurants upstairs and they will cook it however way you would like it cooked. It was a great experience anyway and we wanted to visit the place as well. For a seafood wholesaleMarket , it was pretty clean and organized and not chaotic. It was easy to catch a cab in the other street after we ate. The place closes early in the afternoon so make sure you go there early in the morning or late morning ."
8,1.0,"This is the first time I‚Äôve brought my parents along, and this isn‚Äôt my first time here, was pretty excited as my parents love to have seafood. We had fun selecting our seafood with reasonable price but the nightmare started when we finished our dinner and was going to pay our bills. Couldn‚Äôt believe my own eyes how much it costed us. We had 4 seafood, 3 out of 4 dishes was steam, we only had our crabs stir fried, yet the bill was exorbitant. Our seafood costed 56000won with a fish, 4 abalone, 2 crabs and 8 prawns. The bill for dinning in the restaurant was 71000won."
9,5.0,This isn't a place to save money. It is an experience that is so memorible and delectable it has to enjoyed. My 3 children and niece were mesmerized by all the edible sea creatures for over an hour. When we finally chose our dishes they were prepared upstairs... sushi downstairs (where my hawk of a mother-in-law made sure we got the freshest selection) My five year old had sea cucumber and enjoyed it. I will remember that taste for a long time.
10,1.0,Can vist but advice not buy to cook in the above restaurant.Too expensive.Be Carefull the charger of restaurant charger.Even We asked bf bring It to restaurant.
11,1.0,"We were charged abt 250000 won for cooking service whereas our seafood is around 320000 won.. the cooking service was overcharged‚Ä¶ Will never go again n will not recommend too‚Ä¶ In total , one meal we spend Singapore dollars 600 plus.. for one king crab, 6 scallops, 6 abalone, half steam fish, a piece of bbq salmon, 2 octopus fried with vegetable, one dish of vegetables, one fried rice, 4 pcs of sea urchin, small plate of shading octopus, one plate of fried prawns . 6 adults one kid ‚Ä¶"
12,2.0,Cooking fee is expensive and 1 seat costs 6000 won each. Insane.Seafood is alright but the fee is unreasonable. The sellers always push us to buy their seafood and some of them have bad attitudes.
13,1.0,"Overrated and not worth at all. The seller keep pushing for you to buy from them. Once bought, the restaurant upstairs not bothered to entertain you as I am going with my family , total 4 persons. Finally got a place, after 3 restaurants rejected us as they are expecting more crowds/ table during meal hours. Then the seat and the cooking fee they charge is more expensive than the seafood we bought! Never again will I go to Noryanjin Market, ever."
14,1.0,"The minutes you walked into the fish market. They approach you quickly n very aggressive into buying crab, fish, clam, octopus and etc. We paid $140 for the smaller crab, halibut and some clams. What pissed me off is upstairs restaurant over charged us for sitting and cooking fees included the soup $130.00. Not very honest peoples and wrong way of doing business. Never again.."
15,1.0,"Hmmm...family comes here w high hopes of having fresh fish.  The place is absolutely not tourist friendly.  If you don‚Äôt speak korean then you‚Äôre out of luck.  Instead you get duped into the hands of a racketeer.  A lady and this man on the corner beg us to buy fish.  The man says that this lady owns a restaurant.  Have no idea whether having a connection to a restaurant owner is a must to eat there because I don‚Äôt speak Korean.  So I give into this ploy, buy the fish (30,000 won for a flavorless flat fish slippery-tasting fish that he kept pushing on us, along with a meager portion of salmon and tuna thrown which we had requested) and off we go into this restaurant that the lady leads us to.  The idea is that they would bring the fish to us filleted.   We get side dishes (lettuce leaves and darn-jahng) brought to us and we buy some battered shrimp and fish there.  When we get done we are waved down saying we owe money.  What?  We paid for the fish and the tempura.  What would we owe?  They charged us for not having ordered the soup‚Äîtry 5,000 won per person so 20,000 won.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.  Oh and if the story can‚Äôt get any worse, my husband gets sick from the food.  Yep, upchuck on our trip to Korea.  They should take the license away from these swindlers and make them slough dead skin off of people.  Stay away.  Trust me.  It‚Äôs not worth it."
16,3.0,"It is a big building with live and dead seafood. There are hundreds of stalls selling either shell fish or all sorts of fishes. We went on a Monday late morning and we only see a few Koreans in this market. I guess most Koreans do not come to this market for seafood.We got some prawns, scallops, fish, cockles and octopus and a lady brought us upstairs to a restaurant. The seafood costs about KRW 80,000. The food are either bbq or steamed. I must say that the bbq ones are lousy. The cook basically put the prawns and scallops on a hot plate and waited for the food to be cooked without any oil, butter or any sauces/herbs. They came out dry. As for the cockles, the cook just poured the whole bowl into some hot water to cook the meat. Though the flesh is supple, it becomes dry in a very short while. The fish which is steamed is the best. What many reviewers stated is the same. I was quite shocked that the cooking price came up to KRW80,000, especially for such lousy cooking skills and methods.Overall, good to go and take a look at the live seafood. Buy some if you want, but i would advise to bring back to cook yourself."
17,1.0,"From the past reviews here, I was gamed and prepared to experience the bargaining for such tourist place. But little did I expect the fee at restaurant (door no.17) was more than the seafood purchased at level 1.To summarise, each dish/seafood is chargable 10k to 20k cooking fee, unless u specifically tell the service staff to steam (still chargeable 8k per kg). That is on top  of the 5k per person fee.I have experienced the fish market in other cities in korea, but not as expensive as noryangjin fish market. I can say the seafood at level 1 is fresh and that's it. But as tourist we can bring those around without the restaurant.I have sensed the market was oddly quiet environment @ 11am, not a single other tourist sighted except us and fish sellers. Definitely, restaurant #17 at least, although the service staff explained its is the standard rate there and blah blah. As I was travelling with a large family, I didnt argue much. Lesson learnt. Black listed place. First and worst experience in seoul so far."
18,4.0,"We always make it a point to visit local markets during our tours to see the kind of fresh food they have. This is more like a huge seafood distribution centre which also does retail sales. Despite coming with empty stomachs, we almost couldn't finish all our food. Were too ambitious and bought too much food. Had a king crab, some prawns, abalones, scallops, and huge plate of mixed sashimi for four of us. The steamed king crab was the highlight! Really juicy and full of meat! The abalones were lightly BBQed and it was tender and juicy too! The sashimi was really fresh and we had never eaten so much sashimi at one seating! TIP1: choose those king crab with one leg less ... they charge less per kg for the imperfect crabTIP2: watch out for those ""freebies""... ours (the prawns and scallops) turn out to be not really fresh ..."
19,1.0,"We visited the markets post reading some positive reviews and some not so positive, as well as numerous travel blogs recommending this as a must when coming to South Korea. Well, those that rated it highly must be rating only based on the novelty of the experience or have no culinary experience, a lack of taste buds, low expectations, or a mix of it all. The first part - the seafood market - delivers as expected. Lots and lots of sea creatures to buy either alive or already dead. Including some already ready to eat as sashimi. It may not be to everyone‚Äôs liking though, seeing all these fishes and crustaceans crammed in small containers...so be prepared. A lot of venders, all pretty much selling the same stuff. So shop around for what looks best if you want, and don‚Äôt forget to barter if you can be bothered which is almost an expectation (note that most places don‚Äôt show prices for that reason). It helps to buy all you need from one vendor to get a better price overall.We stopped at one vendor, who actually spoke reasonable English, and bought large prawns, octopus, king crab, scallops and he threw in some free oysters and clams - however I have to say that we got well overcharged for what we chose (yep, we didn‚Äôt really bother bartering), so the free stuff feels a lot more like a sympathy gift, or a bonus for all the money we gave him 195,000 KRW ($240 AUD).(Note: You will have to pay for your food to get cooked, and you pay per item - so stuff they throw in for free, will be charged to be cooked...)After we paid for our sea bounty, the vendor handed us over to a younger guy whom we followed to a restaurant on the second floor. The restaurant looked clean, had two small groups of people, and didn‚Äôt really smell like any cooking had happened. But we sat any ways. The option was only 2 cooking methods, steam or BBQ. The lady serving us took the prawns to BBQ and the rest to steam. We went along with it thinking let‚Äôs trust in the seafood chef. What we got was so disappointing, considering the amazing seafood we had over paid for.None of the food came with any sort of soup, broth, herbs, spices, anything what so ever. The steamed oysters had no flavour (lucky they were ‚Äòfree‚Äô). We wanted them just raw or grilled at most. Maybe some ginger or garlic, something!The crab was nice but bland and dry, again not cooked in any special way - just steamed.The prawns had been cooked on the bbq for way too long - they came so dry and chewy (not cooked with any butter or any sort of sauce). The octopus first came out sashimi - which was a fun first time experience. After a few mouthfuls of moving tentacles, we asked if they could grill the rest of it, but again they came back steamed. We had a few more mouthfuls and left the rest due to lack of flavour - at one point the waitress came over and took the octopus plate away, and returned it having been steamed a second time (you have to laugh at the madness).So...after having selected what we thought was going to be an amazing seafood bounty, paying through the nose for it, we were left completely gutted that they had ruined it all by simply steaming every bit of it, over bbq‚Äôing the prawns, no sauce, no broth/soup, no flavours, not even a garnish. And all of that for 52,000 KRW ($64 AUD)!We left with a lack of delicious flavours playing in our mouths (I was seriously expecting something delicious like I‚Äôve gotten all over Seoul so far on this one month trip), a big hole in pockets, and a very poor view of this ‚Äòhighly rated‚Äô must do when in Seoul experience.Go buy the seafood, barter barter barter (or get a Korean to go with you - maybe even buy them a gift it will still save you money), and take it home to cook yourself, if you need use some YouTube videos or other online cooking guide, I don‚Äôt think you could go any more wrong than what we got served today!"
20,4.0,"You really shouldn't fault the hawkers for doing their job - hawk all that fresh seafood! And the fun is in the banter in broken korean and english with them and if you are keen to eat the freshest and most diverse, then you should try it out. And there will always be a another keen restauranter who would be keen to help you cook and prepare what you have bought. For us, it was fun, and plentiful of good tasty pescetarian delights!"
21,4.0,"Honestly, it's a great place to eat fresh seafood and have it prepared at one of the many restaurants that are located behind the market ans delivered right to your table.Pros: 1. Friendly merchants who attempt to square dab2. Fresh sashimi from a fish that was just swimming in a tank as opposed to those ""frozen"" places that I have to wait to eat so it thaws out before you can even it.3. Fresh oysters cut on the 1/2 shell that melt in your mouth.4. Yummy steamed shrimp served up and ready to peel/eat.  5. Very affordable for a family of 4 if you stick with the basics...All of the above go down well with beer or soju! Enjoy.Cons:1. Be ready for the smell of the fish market and wear your shoes that you don't care about just in case they get wet and smell like seafood for the rest of your trip.2. Sometimes, it takes time to get your fish cooked soup brought to your table."
22,1.0,"The sea products varieties are there. But the hawker are pushing you to buy the king crap or other prized product. Once you bought and you go to 2nd floor to the restaurant, the same attitude is reflecting. They will look at what you have purchased. If you buy too little seafood, they will chase you away or ignore you. Personally for my experience, I have bought abalone, shells, squids and salmon fish and after bargain, only we can eat in one of the restaurant. And the charges of the cooking services(plus the seating place) is much more expensive than the sea product that i bought. Never again will I be back."
23,4.0,"We reached Noryangjin Fish Market via subway, stopped at Noryangjin station, walked out at exit 7. About 50m, enter the tunnel on your right and there are signs leading the way to the market. It took us couple of minutes. First stall we approached was stall number 28. Quote for King crab was 39,000 won per kg. It‚Äôs much cheaper than what we read on tripadvisors so we didn‚Äôt explore other stalls. We bought a 2.5kg King crab, 3 abalones for 10,000won and 5 big size prawns for 10,000won for 3 of us. Happy with our purchase we were led upstairs to the restaurant to prepare our food.  We had the King crab steamed, prawns and abalones grilled. King crab meat was so fresh, tender and sweet. Food preparation came to 45,000won, not cheap. Unless you are willing to go from restaurant to restaurant to compare the food preparation, I would suggest just factor in the preparation price into the seafood price. 165,000 won was really worth it especially for such a huge King Crab."
24,5.0,"Very cheap seafood. You can find variety of fish, squids, lobsters, etc. for a very reasonable price. For me it's very cheap compared to Japan. After select the seafood you want, you can go upstairs and bring them to the restaurant. There would be a cooking service available but quite expensive (but worth it anyway)"
25,4.0,"We went to the wrong direction as we came out from exit 1.The best exit is exit 7. Then u walk 5mins u will see IVY BUILDING on the left (opp the road). Then u see a slope going down to the tunnel - BINGO there u can see a BLUE sign NORYANGJIN MARKET.We went there ard 7.30pm and lots of stalls r open.... We nego 3-4 stalls then we finally settle on one. After/before u pay the seafood, some guys will come and bring you to the restaurant. Dont worry they will let u know the cooking price before u decide ...If u r a die hard seafood fan... Must visit here..Cheap n fresh"
26,4.0,"This is a fun experience for the family especially for kids.  My kids said this is a better experience than the aquarium, because you can see them, touch them and eat them later...LOL.We went there during summer, so not all the vendors were opened, but there are enough vendors for you to choose from.  They have so many kind of seafood, you buy them, and they will cook them upstairs for you.  The king crab is a must!  So much cheaper than getting from a restaurant.  If you re brave enough, try the live octopus, it's a little chewy but very tasty! You do have to neogiate the price to get a good deal, make sure you visit a few more vendors before settle on one.  Overall I'll definitely go back again."
27,5.0,"I love coming here for the fresh Seafood especially the King Crab... One can just choose whatever seafood you and have it cooked in whatever style you liked... However, as it is so fresh, steaming is the best..."
28,4.0,"Fun and adventurous experience. There is an old and new side of the market. I personally prefer the old side, which you will access directly if you came from the train station. It‚Äôs definitely wet and dirty but you enjoy such an unique experience! Honestly most of the stores sell similar items, and I kind of got overwhelmed from them trying to sell their seafood. Some were extra friendly and allowed us to take pictures with their lobsters and even octopus! My favorite part was trying raw octopus (10k won for 4 small ones). I would definitely try it again. Being a little squirmish, I started with small tentacles and kept chewing on it. I didn‚Äôt experience getting sucked by the tentacles thankfully. The freshness and delicious flavor is a huge draw for me! The drawbacks of the market was that the prices were a little high - 190k won for tiger striped fish sashimi and 170k won for crab. The ladies brought us to the restaurant behind (quite old looking and abit shabby). We were charged 100k won for the cooking and other dishes (ban chan, rice) for 9 adults and 2 Children. The tiger striped fish was served as sashimi and the bones were boiled as spicy or non spicy soup. The crab was boiled and tasted very sweet. The fat from the shell was then used to fry rice with seaweed for about 3 portions - tasted very good too. I don‚Äôt know if you can haggle much but it is definitely worth it to check out a few stores before deciding which to go to. One of my favorite experiences in my trip to Seoul/Jeju!"
29,3.0,"Bought a king crab and abalone with some freebies (prawn, scallop, optopus..etc). Was lead to a restaurant upstair to cook our stuff. Was told that restaurant will charge 3k won (restaurant asked for 5k during billing, and we told them we was told 3k before we came up)per pax for cook services, but in actual there some hidden cost associated with each dishes. The 3k is only cover the king crab, cooking scallop and the rest all need extra k. End up the cook services we paid for is equal to the stuff we bought. (Mean total cost became double). We got our stuff at the new market which is just next to the old one. Don‚Äôt be hurry to get your stuff, walk and ask around. Ask each item‚Äôs cook service. As for the taste, seriously just so so only the way they cook it. (Usually either steam or baked)"
30,4.0,"Always wanted to visit this fish market for seafood so i ask my Korean guide to bring me there. As i was with my Korean guide, ask her to help shop for seafood. Ended up with a large whole lobster, 1 kg of scallops and another kg of tiger prawns and the stallholder threw in a 2 or 3 fresh abalone. Didn't think the prices were cheap but i just had a craving for seafood.A restaurant staff member is usually nearby and would handle the fresh seafood and lead us up to his shop. At the restaurant i was brought to, it was 8000 per pax for steaming and grilling my purchase with the usual free flow of side dishes, rice and water. Seafood soup and drinks were at an additional cost. The lobster, scallops and abalone were really well prepared and tasty, the prawns so-so. For a total of 6 pax, we spend a total of 210000 won or about USD 30 per person and my stomach was really full. Don't know if it was expansive for Korean standards but from where i come from, it is reasonable price for fresh seafood especially having a huge whole lobster for lunch."
31,4.0,"If you are battling a little time-zone oddity where you are up early in the morning, too early for other things, the Fish Market is the place to be.  Open all the time, go watch an auction in the early morning or just walk among the hundreds of stalls and tanks of fish, squid, shellfish and things of all manner of delight.  Be sure to check out the older area under the old overpass."
32,1.0,Prices is very expensive. Nothing fantastic! I definitely will not recommend this as a must come place.
33,1.0,"Wrote a review in Nov 2016 and I raved about it. I'll take those words back. Given my previous experience, I decided to bring my parents there this time. Lo and behold, the prices have at least tripled due to high exports to China. Stall owners were all ferocious Chinese ladies and when i tried to bargain a little (I'm not even someone good at bargaining), they shouted and told me to get lost. I tried to find some of the ajummas I was acquainted with before but I couldn't find them at all. This place has been invaded by Chinese merchants and prices are exorbitant. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place anymore."
34,4.0,"Very similar concept with the Addiction Aquatic Development in Taiwan that I visited recently. (I'm sure the latter got the concept from here). There is the old and new wing; I went to the new wing as it is indoors and the weather was just too cold for me. Upon entering, there are many stalls selling similar seafood at similar prices e.g. krw80000 per kg of King Crab, abalone at krw10000/pc, krw10000/2pcs, krw10000/4pcs, depending on the size. Most sales are based on weight so it might be a good idea to ask for the item to be weighed before committing. As most stalls are selling at similar prices, you might want to take a walk and soak in the oceanic atmosphere before buying from the lucky stall. Also, many of the sellers speak Mandarin so bargaining was easy. Other than giving a discount, the sellers might also throw in a few free shrimps or clams to sweeten the deal. After buying, the seller would send you up to their preferred / recommended restaurant on the 2nd floor to prepare your meal. There are generally 2 types of sitting in the restaurants; either the chair or the floor. You don't get to choose the restaurant so I ended up sitting on the floor for my meal, which was pretty uncomfortable. However, the prices are again standardize throughout the restaurants, i.e. krw5000/cover, krw7000/kg for steaming, so you don't have to worry about being overcharged."
35,4.0,"Big fish market, most of them are selling similar produce so walk around before deciding. Most of the stalls are working with restaurants so you can get your food cooked fresh. We bought a lot of seafood and the prices were reasonable. If you're nice enough, the sellers might even throw in some 'service' E.g 4 small Abalone was W10,000 (she gave us two extra pieces). Must visit if you love seafood!"
36,4.0,"The seafood is fresh but the price is not really cheap! We tried king crab, scallops and abalone at krw57000 and the charges for cook is abt krw40000."
37,3.0,"Walking through the market was fun. After bought our seafood, we followed the seller to a restaurant with our fresh live seafood, but the cooker was very mediocre, over cooked, rubbery, salty. Wish we know some good restaurants there before we went. So before you buy your live seafood, it is good idea to find out which restaurant to bring them to, or cook yourself."
38,3.0,"We took the Seoul Metro to the market. We went there to check out if the seafood are cheap. Inside the building that houses the fish market, there are rows and rows of stalls selling seafood. We chose a stall to buy some seafood for lunch. After some bargaining, we bought a Snow Crab (1kg+), 6pcs of medium sized fresh Abalone, 6pcs of large Prawns, 10pcs of Scallops; all for KRW130,000. They stall operator recommended a restaurant upstairs that could cook the seafood for a fee. The restaurant, Dragon Palace, charges exorbitant price for cooking the seafood that we bought from the stall in the market. For all the seafood to be cooked, we were charged KRW80,000 (61% of what our seafood cost). We asked for a breakdown and we were given a ridiculous explanation.Therefore, I would recommend anyone who is interested to make a visit to check out the vast variety of seafood available. You should only buy the seafood IF you are staying in an accommodation with cooking facilities (bring the seafood back to your accommodation to cook)."
39,5.0,"Interesting visit to this seafood market a Korean friend recommended. All sorts of shells and fishes and octopuses. You select what you want to buy and the stall recommends a restaurant upstairs that can prepare it for you immediately. Live fishes were prepared immediately for sashimi, so they are very fresh.Many stalls have Mandarin speaking people, who can help if you can't speak Korean but can speak mandarin"
40,1.0,"Asian looking tourists need to be cautious as they walk through the aisles browsing at the live seafood as some Chinese speaking will try to be friendly and approach you to offer you their seafood at reasonable price.The catch is really on the cooking!  The seafood as you see on the pics cost 55,000 won while the cooking came up to be another 51,400!  I questioned the Chinese speaking restaurant staff on the breakdown to know that she was so hostile and not even bother to explain!  I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my holiday with my children and left the place feeling ripped off!  Please be careful should you visit the stalls and restaurants!  I‚Äôm sure there are black sheep amongst them!"
41,2.0,This is our second visit after 3 years. All I can say is the new market is a total disappointment. Characterless and lots of foreigners selling IMPORTED(so much more salmon being sold and prawns from south east Asia for example) expensive seafood. As the number of stalls have increased I see that most of the live seafood is not as fresh ie most are oxygen starved in crowded tanks. At the restaurants it is all about $. No longer a great local experience this has become just another place to eat expensive seafood especially if you dont speak the language.
42,5.0,"Eating at Noryangjin is not a novelty. I have been to many countries that do the same. But still there is something special about the place. How is how it works. Go look for the food (fresh) in the market. Pick the food you and at the price you want to pay. The seller will accompany you to the row of restaurant that will be so willing to cook it for you. Here is the difference. The variety span from huge snow crabs to oysters. Everything fresh (and moving). My kid was thrilled by the octopus. The sellers do allow him to play with the creature. The best of the whole buying experience is, you can pay by your credit card! Prices are very reasonable. I got the whole snow crab, abalone, sea cucumber, octopus, scallops for US$138. Have that cooked add the fried rice mixed into the crab shell, a hotpot soup and throw in a couple of drinks for another US$78. Total damage for a feast slightly over $200 that can feed 3-4 persons."
43,4.0,The fish market does not stink...No signs of dirt or waste on the floor and well maintained. It is said to be the largest fish market in the world. most of the sea food are live and on demand the dress it up give it. There are near by outlets which offers good and sumptuous sea food. A varied experience . Never thought of visiting a fish market especially in a different country since my country is full of markets and fishes...
44,5.0,"We bought a 4-kg king crab at 50k won/kg (better bargain should be 35-40k won). And brought it up to 2nd  floor restaurant for their cooking and some additional service charge. Still happy, as it is much more expensive in my hometown. Very fresh food, yummy."
45,5.0,"The market was very clean, easy to find ( thanks to google map), all the ahjuma and ahjussi were friendly, large variaty of sea food . We finally get to tried the king crab and its cheaper than where we come fromüòçthe ambiance is so korean as we hardly saw tourists thereWe definately wud love to go back there again, its a must visit place in Seoul"
46,5.0,"On our way to the 63 Building in Seoul we stopped by the Noryangjin Fish Market and was amazed by the variety of seafood available. We were only there for a short time but we saw jumbo-sized shrimps, lobsters, king crabs and lots of other sea creatures that I had never seen before. It's a nice place to buy your fish and have it cooked or fillet the way you wanted. We wanted to grab so much stuff but had other stops along the way. Wish we had more time so we could eat there!"
47,5.0,"The market was located near the subway station and was easily accessible.Choosing your seafood and have it cooked at the 2nd level is indeed a very unique experience for my family of 8.We didnt really look around different stalls and were approached by the 1st stall when we stepped in. As we saw some locals buying from the stall as well, we thought the pricing shd be reasonable. We paid 98k won for 1 king crab, prawns, clams, salmon, 7 abalone, octopus and a local fish. Seafood itself is cheap. The expensive part is getting a seat in the restaurant and getting it cook. i paid 88k won for 8 pax seats and steaming of most of the items and 1 bottle of korean beer. sashimi preparation is foc. I have the fish half in sashimi and half in soup. Overall i think the price is considered reasonable for the freshness and also unique experience. It is cheaper than eating the same items in my country. This place is one of the must see in my list."
48,5.0,"This is a huge indoor fish market, where first floors are venders selling all sorts of live seafood!  you come here, pick a shop; pay for the fresh seafood ingredients and a guy from the 2nd floor where all the restaurants are will bring the food upstairs and process/cook them for a price.   Price is very good so this is a paradise for seafood lovers!  this is one of my favorite place in Seoul!"
49,3.0,"This place is more for locals or tourists with a local guide. It's a typical wet fish market. Most of the seafood are still alive. I had to walk for quite sometime before a gentleman greeted me in English. Apparently, he speaks Mandarin too. So, lucky for us. He explained that I had to choose my seafood from his stall and then follow a lady to a restaurant where the seafood will be cooked and prepared. You have to pay the fish monger for the seafood and pay the restaurant for their service separately. There are a few restaurants so if you're picky, you might want to check out the restaurants first. The price was rather steep but we got to sit with the locals, on the floor, in the restaurant."
50,5.0,"Heard about the Noryangjin fish market - so we decided to make a trip to try out some seafood. Took the subway and it was conveniently located near the Noryangjin station with just about a 10min walk. There were many stores selling almost the same things. Basically you pick some seafood (be sure to bargain) and checkout several stores first before buying. They will then bring you up to a restaurant where they will cook for you.Overall we were very satisfied with the seafood - fresh, well prepared and yummy.The only thing to note is that thy will charge you for cooking the seafood etcThy charge by weight but you'll never know how much thy actually weigh. We paid about  USD40 for cooking of lobsters, abalone, Scallop, prawns etc including drinks.But it's a good experience and satisfying dinner !"
51,1.0,"We visited Noryangjin market in July 2016, selected 1 small crab, 4 small abalones, a little bit of clams, 3 small whelks, a small piece of salmon at the ground floor wet seafood stall and they charged us 90,000Won. The worst part is we still had to pay another 60,000Won at the 1st floor small restaurant just for the seafood to be grilled !!!I personally DO NOT recommend this place for seafood as it was a Total Rip-Off !!!"
52,2.0,"New market is clean, bright and very different from other seafood market.We were there to understand and experience the different kinds of seafood that be found in Seoul.Varieties are great and fascinating.However, TORTING is very rampant to a point it was very disturbing. It seems that the absence of PRC tour groups have deeply impacted the business.It will good if the authority can look into this else the TORTS will severely impact the reputation of the fish market"
53,3.0,"It's a fish market so expect the noise and smell. The old market (nearer to train station) is still operating however places to have your bought seafood cooked is limited and dinghy looking. So we did not buy any seafood but just walked straight through onto the newer market. New market is better lit, better laid out but still wet and fish smelling! Almost all vendors sell the same variety of seafood so unless you want to patiently scout and compare for the cheapest or you could just target one stall and negotiate for the best price you are willing to pay. Becoz it's a tourist trap you are bound to get fleeced regardless. A young Chinese speaking tout followed us around the entire  market which made us feel really uncomfortable. Eventually he confessed that he wanted us to come with him to the restaurant he worked for upstairs to get the seafood cooked. Pls note this cost is separate so do budget for another KRW7k-10k per separate dish to be cooked. There were some hard negotiations between us and the owner and they kept insisting all shops will charge the same for cooking fees therefore no need to price hunt anymore. Totally I paid KRW85,000 for small Alaskan crab, KRW10,000 for 4 small abalones, KRW15,000 for 6 small sea urchins = KRW110K plus another KRW25k for steaming and side dishes. Don't follow the tout, although the restaurant he brought us to was clean, the service was poor and servers try to push sell you with the more ways to cooked seafood and extra costs of course! Do price research prior to going back to"
54,4.0,"We took subway line 4 then line 1 to Noryangyin Station, look for exit 1/2. We took wrong exit and ended up got lost... There are 2 fisherman market, we went to the old one first, was interested what the new one looks like so we didn't buy anything from the old market. The new one was just next to it - much better environment, not sure why they don't move all vendors. We bought live octopus, King Crab, Abalone, shrimp, uni and clams. A guy from one of the restaurant on 2nd floor lead us the way to the restaurant. We think the restaurant charged too much, consider we only paid $125 for all the seafood while the restaurant charged us $58... live octopus was a fun experience."
55,4.0,"Eating live octopus is on our list for this trip.  It was fun and unique experience.  There are many fish stalls inside both new and old markets.  The sellers kept selling aggressively. So it helps if you have ideas of what kind of seafoods you want first.  Go around most of the stalls at least once before started the conversation with the sellers and until you found the one has all of seafood type you want.  The sellers started with a higher price, there's  room for negotiation if you purchased all your seafood in one stall.  Each stall works with a restaurant who will cook the seafood for you.  The restaurant is not fancy just an authentic place to enjoy the fresh seafood."
56,4.0,"My family has been wanting to try live octopus and this is definitely on our top priority to do list when we visited Seoul.  Other than live octopus, we get to select other live seafood and have them cooked the way you want it. Wonderful experience!"
57,4.0,"this market is the largest fish market in korea i think and i can't remember having seen something similar in other places in Korea (even in Busan). I do not like raw fish but I found very interesting to watch at all the different fishes and seafood and the life of the market. There are other types of seafood that in Europe. Tough, if you are not a seafood or market lover, i would not recommend the visit as there are no other sights nearby. My korean Mum bought a fish that the fishmonger prepared as sashimi to eat at home (and some beef for me from another shop !) You should not expect some cheap prices because it is a large wholesale market if you buy as private. As an industrialized and rich country, prices are in Seoul generally very similar to Europe (for instance France or Italy). Dry fish specialities (dry anchovies for instance) and Korean ginseng are expensive !"
58,3.0,"It is easy to travel there by the subway and once you tap out, you'll see many signs directing you to the market. It is tough to haggle sometimes, with sellers attempting to give you free seafood instead of lowering the price. Once you enter, it is quite likely that a local would start following and helping you to communicate with the sellers. This local would be an employee from one of the restaurants on the second level who would bring you to his restaurant subsequently where they will help cook the seafood which you have bought. Although the final cost is pricey, the seafood is indeed fresh. If you don't mind skipping the experience of the market, I would suggest just going straight to a well-known seafood restaurant in the city as the price point would be similar."
59,4.0,"We were looking for a nice but not crowded place to have lunch and suddenly the idea of eating at a local fish market crossed our minds. Location was good as it took only few minutes from subway station. There were hundreds of stall selling fresh seafood. We chose to buy at the outside and old area, and brought what we had to a nearby restaurant so they helped us to cook. Seafood was of course really fresh, delicious. Service was good though people could speak a very basic English. It was expensive but worth a visit and try I think."
60,4.0,"Choose the seafood that you want at the market and then the restaurant upstairs will cook the seafood for you. My family bought a king crab and a sole fish. The restaurant boiled the crab for us and deep-fried the fish. The seafood was served with rice, salad, kimchi and spicy sauce. It was delicious, although overpriced."
61,4.0,"What an amazing experience. Of all the times we've been to Korea, we have never been here before. My only recommendation would be to walk around first before getting sucked into a vendor. We weren't sure what to do so when my mom asked one of the ladies we got pressured into buying our fish from her but she had no other types of seafood. After we went up to the restaurant my mom had to go back down to find different types of shellfish for us to try. Other than that it is a definite must try if you are a seafood lover!"
62,4.0,"My experience on Noryangjin Fish Market was an interesting one. Apparently, I learnt that I came at the wrong time. My wife and I came around 6pm and the market was so crowded with locals! After we bought our seafood ingredients, the restaurants were full and we were stranded with no place to go. I almost wanted to give up because we were hungry and it was hard to communicate with the locals. After almost an hour, we finally found a table to settle down and got our ingredients cooked and served. That was when the night got slightly better. The highlight of the night was the live octopus. Loved it. Not cheap, I guess.Throughout our dinner, two local guys who sat beside us even shared their sashimi with me. They spoke basic English and they were very polite. Delicious food and what a night it was. I recommend the visit due to its uniqueness but not during their peak hours."
63,4.0,"Bargain, bargain, bargain. It can be tiring if one doesn't like it. So Noryangin may be a one-off experience for us. King crab was fabulous tho it's was only boiled. Grilled abalone was to die for.Best prices we got for the seafood before cooking:King crab: KRW155K for 2.8kg ++ crabAbalone: KRW10K for 3 good sized onesWish you guys luck!"
64,4.0,I'm the grilled fish lovers so this is my best place for finding good and fresh fish in Seoul. You can find variety of fish selections at wholesale price. Everything here is fresh and still can be negotiable. There also small restaurant on 2nd floor if you want to cook right away and small stall on ground level beside the building. They also have a new fish market beside old market.
65,3.0,"Nothing compared to Tsukiji Japan. Not worth visiting. You basically shop for seafood downstairs and bring it to 2nd floor where you can choose a restaurant to cook for you. But .. Cost $3000 w per person service charge for seating in the restaurant. Cooking charges is $7000 w per dish. For 4 dishes and 4 person - need to pay $40,000w, that's with zero food. Prawns, abalone are charge by per kg."
66,1.0,"The reason I rate this place terribly is because I am comparing this place to the many fish markets I have visited before in Japan, Taiwan and China. Fresh seafood is a given and what else do you expect? However, the cooking is another matter. At Tsukiji in Tokyo, you eat exquisite sashimi and sushi. Fresh fish cooked in Chinese style brings out the delicate texture of the fish. Noryangjin is a letdown in the dining aspect. The only exception is the grilled Alaskan crab.The ground level is where fresh seafood is sold but it is advisable not to buy yet. It is more important to go upstairs and get a table in any of the restaurants. The restaurants have linked up with the vendors anyway and will get the type of seafood you desire. If you have not been to a fish market, then Noryangjin or other seafood markets in South Korea would be an eye opener otherwise it is nothing unique. Allocate 10-20 minutes of exploring a section of the vast market then head upstairs for lunch or dinner. Avoid peak period if you do not have any reservation."
67,1.0,"We initially wanted to have our dinner at the market, after hearing that we can pick our fresh fishes and have them cooked. The market was large, with many stores neatly arranged in rows selling almost the same thing. This has obviously caused a lot of competition among the stall holders. Seeing us as a large group (12 of us), we were being tugged and haggled by almost every stall to buy from them. Mistaking us from mainland China, they started speaking mandarin to us. We stopped at a stall to inquire on the price of the king crab, which is apparently in season, and was shocked that it will cost us 200,000 Won (cost of cooking not included). Since we are a big group, we will need 2 crabs....! Now, this is much more expensive then in Japan or even at the seafood restaurant back home. Frustrated, we left the place and decided on dinner elsewhere."
68,4.0,"Local markets are always a sight to behold, as they exude so much of the local culture. In terms of uniqueness, markets will always be markets, but that doesn't mean the Noryangjin Market is not worth the time.In fact, come prepared with your cameras to capture some of the most amazing seafood up for sale in this market. You can see a lot of different seafood up close, such as stingrays, abalone, lobsters, crabs and even eels. Just be sure not to stay at each stall for too long and take too many photos, because some shop owners will not be pleased and are generally intolerant with tourists. Some owners will be outrightly displeased and may even scream at you, but that is just how they are, so as long as you ignore them you will be fine.If you do love sashimi, choose a friendly shop owner and they will recommend the freshest fish to you. Of course, coming in a big group and ordering more will also mean that you can get bigger discounts. One thing I recommend is to try sannakji (ÏÇ∞ÎÇôÏßÄ), which is live octopus. Be careful, though, as the tentacles may suck onto your tongue, so be sure to chew it thoroughly before swallowing it. It is a pretty unique experience that you should try since you are already there anyway.To get there, take Seoul Subway Line 1 to Noryangjin Station, and get out from exit 1. You will cross a small overhead bridge over the train tracks, and then walk down several flights of stairs to the market."
69,1.0,"It was a good experience at the market. The kids saw many interesting seafood. The sellers do not speak English but they speak Mandarin so it helps if you can speak Mandarin. We don't know much about the prices of seafood. We bought a king crap, lobster, 4 pc of abalone and half a portion of salmon sashimi for KRW100,000. Not sure if that is cheap. We realised that there will be a ""runner"" once they know you are going to buy some seafood so that they can set up the restaurant to cook your food. They will whisk the food away from you to the restaurant which is located behind the market. We basically had steamed crap and lobster, barbecued abalone,  fried seaweed rice (using crab roe) and salmon sashimi. The steamed lobster was not done well. The meat was hard and we could hardly eat it. Perhaps it shouldn't be steamed but this was recommended by the restaurant. The cooking of the food is a separate charge that cost us KRW60,000 for just steaming, barbecuing and 3 portions of fried rice with no drinks. I think that is very expensive considering we only paid KRW100,000 for the seafood. So be very careful with the restaurant charges. It's the most expensive meal we had in Seoul!!!"
70,4.0,"Went on a Monday afternoon to avoid crowd.  Easy access via overhead bridge connecting the train station.  Walked between the old and new and had lunch at the old market.  Fresh snow crab & lobster about KRW42k each and other seafood such as bamboo clams, little oysters, prawns & live octopus about KRW10k each type.  Seller brought us to a nearby stall that help customers cook the seafood to their liking at a charge.  We paid about KRW50k for 4 pax 7 dishes.  Not sure if this is reasonable, guess depending where you come from.Remember to pickup a latte or smoothie outside the markets at a little store between both market."
71,2.0,"Bring my 6th month old baby along, and I don't think here is a suitable place to bring baby along. Bought some fresh seafoods (prawn, abalone, scallop and shell) from the market and bring it to the nearby restaurant for lunch. That's only two way to prepare for the food. Either steam or bbq ( fried with butter may be). The seafoods all taste the same after cooked. nothing special to me."
72,4.0,"After seeing this place on Travel channel I've always wanted to go. You buy what you want to eat then take it to a close by restaurant in the same building or outside area. Buying your choice of seafood is pretty fun since there's sooooo much to choose from. Then you take it to a restaurant to get it cooked or prepared for you, now here's the downfall... It seems almost no one wants to prepare what you bought but we finally found a place which was outside. It was a bit pricey seeing it's not like you have to purchase the food from the person cooking or preparing it, but all in all it was an interesting experience."
73,4.0,"Ignore your runners (people in yellow/ blue vests that befriend you while you buy seafood) and find a good restaurant yourself. Make sure you read these reviews and know what you're doing (even if you don't). We went to a new restaurant (I'll leave a picture down) which charged us relatively cheap per kg. We were satisfied and happy with the experience! Make sure you count your fishy blessings (price!) before you sit down. Go to the locals, trust me on this :)"
74,4.0,"Visited this fish market with my teenage daughter, who wanted to come and try our the live octopus. We ordered salmon sashimi and 2 live octopuses from the market stalls selling the food. Then bring the food to a nearby restaurant for preparation. The restaurant gives us condiments and sauces to eat with the sashimi. It's certainly tasty!"
75,4.0,"Took the subway line to Noryangjin Fish Market, very easy to located this place if you are taking the public Seoul Subway. Walking in to this indoor fish market like walking in to a 'indoor ocean', many types of fresh seafood from alantic ocean to pacific ocean water. Of course we are not able to communicate well with the vendor there, but if you do speak Mandarin, they are few vendor do speak Mandarin and it will help with your seafood bargaing process. Like usual, you can pick the seafood and get it weight for the price, if you are happy just pay it, or you love the bargain.. enjoy it. Then, if you want to have your seafood there, the vendor will help you to carry it up to the selected restaurant. The restuarant will choose the best way to make the seafood as taste as original from sashimi way to steamed or cook it according to your choice. You have to pay for it, not really expensive as most of the cooking is just simple steamed. You can also buy the seafood home and cook it at home.Most tourist misunderstood the whole buying and eating in the restaurant procedure.Step 1: You pick, weight and agree the price then you pay (no cooking charge incl)Step 2: If you want to seafood to me cook by the restaurant, the vendor will help you to bring it to the restaurant or you bring it homeStep 3: You want the restaurant to cook it, of course you have to pay for it. You can ask for the price first if you worry if is a scam, but I personally find it ok. Enjoy your fresh seafood !"
76,5.0,"You can enjoy to buy the seafood and cook at the 2nd floor of local restaurant. Not cheap to cook compare with the seafood because it is simple cook or fresh to eat. If you compare BBQ beef or pork, it is cheaper and worth to eat, King Crab, Octopus, sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchin...etc Very delicious"
77,3.0,"Perhaps it was the time we went weekday just before lunch but there was not as many stalls opened. This was a new building and very clean for a wet market, all the restaurant are upstairs and usually the stalls you buy from will take you to their affiliated one. Food wasn't so great for young children since they can't take sashimi and spicy food. But the fresh sea urchin tasted so heavenly compared to the ones in Singapore."
78,3.0,"We buy 2 octopus for 10K won, 1 king crab for 20K won and 1 big plate salmon sahimi for 20K won. Thats worthed!Nice fish market."
79,2.0,"Finding this place was hard.The place is dirty, staff not friendly .If you kana  stop by n watch ,they staff that speak Chinese will persuade you to buy their seafood and say lots of things just to hook you .They can cook the seafood that you picked for you ,let you sit in a comfortable .Price of seafood you pay first.Cook different pay separately Per person charges In the end pay a lot ...eat nothing .Not worth it ."
80,4.0,"This is the second time we are at Noryangjin Fish Market. We had been visiting the older one and decided to try the new block. The seafood is still good and my son loves the abalone. Tried the sea urchin this time, 2 for 10000 won. They were fresh and sweet. The seafood sellers usually don't speak other language but there are runners who do speak mandarin and English to support them as well as leading the customers to the restaurants to cook the seafood purchase. The preparation rates are stated for the different ways in the restaurant or can always check."
81,4.0,"Went with my family of 6, and we had/ price in k'KRW: 1 king crab weighing 2kg+ (Russian or Alaskan I do not know)/ 70k, 4 abalones/ 10k, 1 halibut /60k (forgot the weight), 3 or 4 small octopuses/ 10k. Paid a restaurant a charge of 56k for preparation of food; steamed the crab, had half the halibut raw and the other half in soup, barbequed the abalones and had the octopuses raw. When we went into the market, we were followed by a chinese-speaking man who tried to ""help"" recommend us the seafood. Found him bothersome after awhile so went up to the 2nd floor to look around and to choose our own place. Plenty of restaurant runners around, don't think they are trying to rip you off, just there to earn a commission. Just ignore them if you don't like it, I did. Good prices, especially when compared to where I came from. The vendors will throw in some freebies as well (I got some salmon sashimi when I bought the halibut)"
82,4.0,Quite pricey for some items but overall worth it.  Great place to try some Korean delicacies.  Moving baby octopus and penis fish or worms.  You choose what you want to call it.  Wet area so leave your nice shoes at the hotel.  From Myeongdong to the market costs less than $10 usd.   Much less of a hassle vs going through the subway.
83,3.0,"We first walked into the newer looking building.... But it's the warehouse building that you want to go to.  There is a ton of seafood in there but after walking several aisles, they will all start looking the same...  We ended up buying a snow crab.  It cost us $45,000 won.  I think we got ""touristed""... The fish sellers speak a little English and some mandarin.  Here's the thing... The price per kilogram is not listed for the crabs so I feel like it's whatever they say it is particularly since we don't speak or read Korean!  This would be an excellent place to come with a Korean speaking person... Anyways, we took our crab to a restaurant on the first floor where part of the dining area is in an alley... It's a bit dirty.. Okay... A lot dirty ... We asked that our crab be steamed... The crab was sweet but way over cooked... They charged us a $5,000 won service fee... This is quite an experience... But never again unless I'm there with a Korean speaking person.  I think I could have done a much better job steaming the crab!"
84,4.0,"Very easy access as it is almost part of the Noryangjin subway station ( just crossed a bridge). The kids had lots of fun looking at all fish and seafood. We got a two big plates of fresh sashimi for 25,000 won for home but you can also eat there in a restaurant."
85,5.0,"There are lots of stalls selling fresh seafood in the market despite the poor environment. The foods are delicious, i especially recommend the king crab which costs around 120000 won for a several kg crab. Even if steamed without any seasoning, its meat is scrumptious, juicy and just perfect. You should definitely visit there by metro station Noryangjin (Line 1,9)"
86,3.0,"We went late evening, around 6, all the kiosks were still open and the seafood still fresh. We got a big plate of sashimi, cost us around W60,000, and we ate at nearby restaurant , at the end we need to pay for a drink and a big bowl of fish soup, cost us another  W30,000. This place worth a visit, although some of the shopkeepers a bit pushy but I think they are not going to overly charge you, just ask them to give extra, more likely you will get."
87,4.0,"Being an admirer of the Tsukiji Fish Market, had to go to Noryangjin.  Easy to access via the Noryangjin Station (Line 1), just walk on the bridge going over the train tracks, and you are there. Great to use all your senses as you experience this vibrant market.  Not much of an auction as Tsukiji, but more tourist friendly, easily walkable without getting run over by forklifts.  Many hawkers who speak multiple languages, trying to sell you all sorts of seafood, the most popular being sashimi platters, live baby octopus, and king crab.  Interesting to see a sale in progress, with price negotiations going back and forth, followed by not the fall of a gavel, but a pick to the head of the fish - once dead, you bought it. You will then bring your kill upstairs to a dozen or so restaurants who specialize in preparing the fresh seafood you just purchased downstairs.Really interesting experience and worth the trip."
88,3.0,"The seafood market had endless stalls of fresh seafood. We decided to give it a try and bought some live seafood from one of the stalls. The price was reasonable and we were taken to a restaurant outside next to the market.  The cooking was bad because the restaurant just steam the food without any sauce. Even the seafood that was barbecue came back dry and was not marinated at all. We were totally disappointed with the cooking at this restaurant. To enjoy the live seafood in this market, it's better to go with a local who knows where to find the right restaurant to cook the seafood."
89,3.0,"We have went there for lunch, but we don't really enjoy the food there, I am not sure it is because of the freshness or the way they cook it, but I would recommend the fish market in Japan and Taipei over this one.  Price is cheap and most of the people there speak Mandarin, but very little english."
90,1.0,"Do avoid the restaurant just outside the main building where all the fresh seafood stalls are. If you are walking from the subway station, you will walk through a underpass and once you are out of it, the restaurant lies on your right and beside it is a stall selling ready fried tempura.Today I bought my king crab at one of the seafood stalls along with some other seafood, paying 90,000 won for a 2 kg crab and paying additional for some other seafood. Then the fresh seafood stall had a staff who led me to the restaurant. It was damn ridiculous that when my crab was served, it was short of a pincer and the remaining crab was served in whole with the remaining pincer with 6 legs. When I confronted the restaurant staff, she claimed that the crab I brought over was already short of a pincer. This was not possible as I had personally selected the crab, saw it weighed, packed and brought it over to the restaurant. The huge pincer probably got 'tourist taxed' by one of the glutton kitchen staff for his lunch.Despite paying the 3000 won/pax for the base on top of the itemized cooking fee for each dish, I wasn't even served the usual Korean side dishes (eg. Kimchi and the other usual stuff) which I saw was served to the adjacent tables with local Korean guests.Worst of all, both my daughter and I had diarrhea after that. I am still experiencing colic as I write this review now. ;(Therefore, I would discourage any tourist from visiting the noryangjin fish market. But if you really still want to have a meal there, do make sure that you have a Korean speaking friend with you to minimize the risk of being taken for a ride."
91,5.0,"Unlike Tokyo Tsukiji fish market which only tends to wholesaler, Seoul Noryangjin fish market market tends to retailers. Noryangjin is a very large fish market that has all kinds of fresh seafood, from fish to shell fish to imported seafood from other countries like China. Sliced up fish for sashimi is available. However one can buy an entire fish and bring it to a restaurant on the upper floor for the restaurant to prepare the sashimi dish.The restaurant can prepare any type of seafood. Fish bones will be used for a soup broth.Live octopus is pretty gross since they still move even after being cut up.It is a place that must be visited in Seoul for seafood lovers."
92,5.0,Seeing the variety of seafood makes me full already. I had seen several types of crab for the first time. Most of the vendors offer discounts and connected to restaurants if you like to have your item be cooked.
93,3.0,Here is a colourful display of 'live' seafood of all shapes and sizes. On one-end there an area where wholesale business of bidding is done daily. Whilst most of the remaining area is dedicated to retail sales to end-consumers and local-resellers.
94,4.0,"One of the places anyone in Seoul should visit, this wholesale market offers a pretty good selection of seafood ranging from sea urchins to octopuses. You can choose your desired catch then arrange with the fishmonger to cook your seafood on the second floor. Do note that cooking is charged per kilogram, on top of the catch you purchased in the market. Everything here is slightly inflated, and do make sure to bargain before purchase."
95,5.0,"Be prepared to be completely overwhelmed not only at first sight, but for the duration of the time spend here under the cavernous roof.  Aisles and aisles and aisles of vendors all more than eager to sell (with some unfortunately, as you would find anywhere there is great competition, even going a bit beyond hawking to being downright annoying).  We (there were four of us) ended up choosing Stall #50 (a friend of a friend recommended it) as our purveyor of the evening meal which consisted of bass, flounder, crab, heads-on shrimp, and scallops in the shell.  We then adjourned to the adjacent restaurant where our food had simultaneously arrived beautifully prepared, raw (except for the crabs) and absolutely delicious.  Without a doubt, a couple of Korean beers were definitely in order for us and the evening came to a most satisfying conclusion.  Total cost was about $130.  Unfortunately, one has to exit Noryangjin the same way as entered; the former of which was really painful since we ate so much we could not stand to see any more seafood!!!"
96,5.0,"Went with my in-laws, who have this place completely wired. What they do is visit three or four stalls (they come here regularly, and have their favorites), select a nice‚Äîand HUGE‚Äîvariety of stuff, and pay for it on the spot.That's when stuff gets crazy. They then go downstairs to an area out of a movie set‚Äîvia a back staircase that you wouldn't know goes anywhere‚Ä¶ unless you're among the knowing.It's an underground labyrinth of dim-fluorescent, puddled concrete hallways that looks definitively employees-only. But it isn't. Behind at least a few unassuming doorways are full-on dining rooms, where they will, for a reasonable fee, cook up what you just bought upstairs. However you like it. With extra banchan and goodies to make it a proper sit-down meal.During my trip there we encountered a few adventurous Europeans along with a busy, bustling assortment of workaday Seoulites. The non-Koreans in the room, myself included, shared a little smile the whole time. Like we'd just been let behind the curtain by mistake. To where the real stuff is. The good stuff.Highly Recommended. It's an experience you'll never forget."
97,4.0,"Total for 1.8 kilo king crab, 4 abalone, 3 prawns, 8 scallops was 130‚Ç©. However table clean up and cooking fees was 66‚Ç©. Make sure you ask how much it will cost to have your seafood cooked before you purchase your items. The seafood itself was cheap but cooking fees were ridiculous."
98,4.0,"I doubted to go there aftere reading some reviews on tripadvisor about the cold ,the wet floors etc.  I went with my sandals and venue was as hot as outside, my feet didn,t get wet at all and the amount of fish is amazing.  I surely recommend it. We went around noon."
99,5.0,"It was definitely a new experience for me. You go into a shop (and there's hundreds or them), pick a fish that's carefreely swimming in a tank, then the shopkeeper will kill (yes, I said kill. You don't want to bite on alive fish, do you?) the fish right before your eyes, voila, freshest seafood you'll ever taste in how ever way you want to eat it. The shops are usually affiliated with little restaurants within the market, after they clean the fish you can take the fish and go to the restaurant they recommend and dine in; all the pay for in the restaurant is  the rice and maybe the spicy fish hotpot made from the fish you bought, Super cheap, high quality, ridiculously fresh seafood."
100,3.0,"Loads of variety and many shops located in the building.  However,  not a must go unless you are into seafood.  Although the sellers are polite, you feel like you are in China, as they will speak to you in Chinese as long as you looked like one. Thus,  not a very local feel to it.Spoke to one of the sellers. Most of them come over from China and they spoke fluent korean as they spoke Korean since they were young as their homeland is located near to Korea."
101,4.0,"This was something that my husband and I wanted to do and just happened to drag our 6 year old and 3 year old with us.  If only all the people contemplating a visit to the Fish Market could see it's cultural magic through the eyes of children again.  Most adults will go into with a jaded preconceived notion of fishy smells, curious new-to-them species and maybe a chance to try a new seafood dish.The sheer size of this market was overwhelming as well as the first sniffs of the briny expectations but to turn around and see the market through the eyes of my children was an experience that will have us going back again and again during the duration of our 2-3 years here. When we first entered the seemingly dimly lit warehouse all of our heads were on a swivel and my 3 year old's face expressed his concern over the smell.  Once we started walking among the stalls the kids couldn't take enough in, their eyes full of awe at the tanks full of funny looking fishies, and mollusks, cephalopods and skates.  At one point we walked passed a particular tank fully of lively octopus trying to make their great escape, much to the delight of my 3 year old son who didn't seem to understand he could not have one for a pet.  My 6 year old daughter couldn't stop giggling at the shocked ""faces"" of the skates on ice. The sheer quantity of seafood available was stunning, as was the amount of fresh and/or live creatures available of purchase and if you have any wee beasties with you I would keep alert of their personalities and what they can/can't handle. My 6 year old is particularly sensitive in this regard and we had a few close calls, including our own purchase of a halibut fish to be fileted, and needing to shield her from their demise for fear of ending our adventure early in tears or having to buy all the fish to set free!The vendors were absolutely phenomenal interacting with the kids, letting them touch and hold and ogle to their little delights which ultimately helped us decided which vendors we wanted to purchase from! Their eyes were shining with the pure joy of experiencing something so new and foreign to them, a sensory overload they thoroughly enjoyed. Asking questions as small kids are wont to do and even encouraging us to buy new food they have never tried(and trust me I""ve asked! LOL).  In the end, you can choose your own purchases and restaurants on the premises will cook to your tastes, an experience we hope to have for next time as after an hour and a half or so the kids senses were feeling overwhelmed and we needed to get home to put our purchases away.I would highly recommend this as a family trip, educational or just for fun. Your senses will be buzzing in all regards as you walk back out into the sunshine, the briny wisps of air following after you:)"
102,5.0,"What a cultural experience this is!  Go to enjoy the sights and sounds and smell of a real fish market.  A photographers dream.  Even though I was one of only a few tourists there, no one seemed to mind that I was there to just look and take pictures.  Definitely worth the trip."
103,5.0,"Went straight here upon my arrival. Didn't like it at first but upon seeing the variety of seafoods I was quite amazed with how gigantic some lobsters, crabs, etc were. I couldn't help but go on a wild seafood spree and taste everything I can see. If we only have this in Manila, I would definitely refrain from eating Meat and shift to simply eating Fresh Seafoods."
104,4.0,"Good experience experiencing the local culture and a wet seafood market.  We bought our live fresh seafood from the wet market downstairs and had a tourist friendly restaurant upstairs to have it cooked for us.Cooking costs / charge is $3,000 Won per head and ranging from $7,000 to $10,000 Won per type of seafood/ kg depending on the cooking method, if it is sashimi, steamed, grilled etc.Would recommend the live abalone and the long-leg Alaskan crab."
105,4.0,"We firstly went around in the market to see what the seafood stalls were selling.  Do not buy anything until you have some ideas about what you can get.  Some people working there could speak Mandarin which gave us some convenience.  If you can't make decisions about what to get, you could tell the seafood stall your budget and they will give you suggestions.  That was exactly what we did.  The vendor took us to a restaurant and the people there did the cooking for us.  We had to pay the cooking fee."
106,4.0,Been to many fish markets. Worthwhile to visit this one.  If you want to do more than just stroll through (although that alone is worthwhile) you will need to speak Korean or have a guide.
107,2.0,"We went with a lot of kids.. The place is not so smelly compared to my hometown fish market. However, the place is packed especially the restaurants. The food is quite costly too..."
108,5.0,"A visit is a must to this fish market. Need to be able to bargain for a reasonable price (not cheap). You get the freshness of the seafood. Oysters are very cheap at USD5 per plate. The locals love their flatfish sashimi and with the bones, they get to a restaurant and have them boil in soup.All stalls at the front rows sell almost the same stuffs. They are the closest to the 2/F restaurants' stairways. Some have runners that take you up to the restaurant once selected seafood is purchased. The sashimi are sliced in front of you and lay on a plate where you carry along. Did not go to the 2/F restuarants, but went to one located just outside the market where locals go to. There are fresh juices, coffee and tempura stalls at the entrance of this restaurant. Price per person is USD3, excluding cooking fee. Cooking fee is by size (S,M,L) and not weight of the seafood. Easily 3 hours, if  SPCF (Select, Purchase, Cook and Feast)"
109,4.0,"A huge fresh seafood market. We try it after peak dinning hours so we can select whatever we like and let restaurant at 2/F prepare it. Exactly, as too much choice, do not overall order."
110,4.0,"This is my second review of Noryangjin Fish Market and third time there, and I thought it will be good to advise tourists not to go on a Friday night or peak hour, unless you have reservations. My previous experiences was all at off-peak hours in the afternoon, so we pretty much walked around and choose the seafood and restaurants we want at ease. You can either buy your seafood on the first floor and get the restaurants on the 2nd floor to cook for you at a charge, or order in the restaurants on the 2nd floor and they will get the seafood directly to cook for you. This time, we went on a Friday night (not realizing it till we were there) and there were so many people in the restaurants! We could buy our seafood easily from the first floor but it was a challenge finding a restaurant to cook for us. We tried to go to Jin-nam restaurant, which I went last time where the lady boss recommended good food and not pushy, but it was fully booked for an event. So we tried asking other restaurants and most of them were full and refused to take us in. Then this mainland Chinese lady was telling us to go to their restaurant and told us if we ordered a certain amount of sashimi from them, they could cook our seafood for free, but when we sat down, she gave us another menu which was double of what she quoted us, so we felt cheated and left. While we were finding another restaurant, she was standing there taunting us that we couldn't be able to eat at all that night. We were so put off with that kind of attitude! Luckily for us, another restaurant just had a reservation cancelled and our family of 7 were able to finally sit down and eat. With kids in tow, it was super stressful. There was 2 young ladies whom we met and they went around with their small portion of sashimi and no restaurant want to take them in at all, especially on such a busy night.Love the energy of the fish market, love the fresh seafood, but make sure you go to a restaurant that states clearly the prices (the final restaurant we went had prices printed clearly on the walls). And if you can't avoid going at peak periods, try to get your hotel to make a reservation for you to save yourself from stress and disappointment."
111,4.0,"Huge fish market with lots of choice. You can buy food and have it cooked on the 2/F at one of the restaurants. Or else, you can just pop up to the 2/F and order a la carte. Fun experience as you need to sit on the floor in the restaurants.  We ate at Sashimi and the food was lovely. Be careful not to over-order as there are lots of side dishes as well!"
112,4.0,"Seafood is abundant here. Can just buy and bring to a shop/ restaurant to prepare, or just buy back. We bought raw oysters (real cheap) and abalone. The kids had fun looking at the live seafood in tanks."
113,4.0,"Went with our children, so many different types of fresh seafood. We took the Metro in from Seoul Station, it was after 7.30. Confused as to how it would work so we walked along the restaurants on 2nd floor but many were full. Went downstairs and started walking around. As a previous reviewer mentioned the stall owners can speak mandarin and were asking us to buy. One sweet old lady approached us and we decided to get the seafood from her as she was not pushy and her prices were reasonable. She then recommended a restaurant behind the stalls it was on the ground floor where all the stalls were. We had so much good sashimi and cooked food."
114,3.0,We took the subway to Noryongjin station (line 9) after visiting Yeouido. Get out at exit 1 and walk about 50 metre before turning right into an underpass which sells vegetables and dried goods. The market is really wet so wear a good pair of shoes. I find the seafood to be pricey as the sellers know we are tourists so it will be good to bring a Korean friend along (if any).. there are restaurants on the upper floor where they will cook the seafood which you have just bought so it is really fresh! but again you have to pay....
115,2.0,"Went here with a party of 8. 7 Hong Kong + 1 expat.  Once you have purchased the food in the market they will take you to a local restaurant to have it cooked. Each stall has its own preferred local restaurant.Take your time and explore the market. It is large and offers some very interesting photos ops.For example, all the kids in our group have photos of them holding a large crab.We had a fairly large group and purchased a wide range of foods. Splashed out on a large crab which was very overpriced. The same kind of crab in HK would have been less than half the price and cooked better (or maybe just cooked in a way we prefer).  I think it was slightly over cooked but cannot be sure.If you are on your first visit to Asia then this is a must do experience. If you have been before then there are better. We found the market expensive and the cooked food a bit bland. We are glad we did it as part of our holiday but we have no need to go back."
116,5.0,"I really liked this place. A pity they are not on most tour itineraries but if you have a private tour guide/ driver like I did, ask them to take you here. There are many stalls all selling live fish, octopus, prawns, clams, abalone etc. You buy whatever you like and they will organise for one of the adjacent restaurants to cook them for you - steamed, barbecued, sashimi etc."
117,5.0,"Love the atmosphere at this fish market. There are so many types of seafood to see. It's also a great place for photography enthusiast. And if you prefer to sample the seafood, you can buy them and bring to the restaurants on the first floor building adjacent to it. The restaurant will cook for you."
118,5.0,"This place was so cool.  We picked out some octopus and three fish  which they carried back and immediately prepared raw for us.  We walked 20 yards to the restaurant.  The fish came out raw, and the octopus was still squirming.  Then they made the leftover fish parts into a stew, and we could make it a hotpot experience by cooking fish we hadn't eaten raw.  Perfect"
119,5.0,"This fish market is huge and in a better shape than many fish markets I have seen after 7 years Asia! It wet everywhere(so take closed shoes) but for a fish market clean and still the right amount of dirty :-) My son loved it and the sales staff at the booth are really nice with kids! They let them hold the fish or octopus! It is a good place to show your children again where food comes from and how it comes to our plate! I would advice going here,... Go also deeper in the market,... than it gets a bit more local,... the front seems to be already a wee bit more for tourist!As many people wrote already bad things about the small ""restaurants"" upstairs,.. we did not go!"
120,4.0,"The market is in a pretty shabby looking building situated close to the river. Once inside it was interesting to wander around the multitude of stalls to examine the many different kinds of seafood available : clams, mussels, lobsters, squid, octopus , prawns, crab and countless varieties of fish. After 45 minutes of looking, haggling and walking around we bought all the seafood we wanted and then headed to the restaurants upstairs to get it all cooked. We chose a very basic looking restaurant which had low tables with plastic covers and no chairs. I don't remember the name but have attached a photo. I must say most of the food was cooked to our liking and the overall price , if not cheap, was acceptable. Overall it's an experience which might not appeal to everyone but if you want to do something different in a very informal setting and you love seafood then it's worth dedicating a couple of hours."
121,1.0,"The fish market itself is..... just like a fish market. You will get to see huge shell fish but that's about it.Main visit purpose is for the famous ""live"" seafood with our tour guide who leading us to a stall beside who he indicated they can help cook our purchase with a small token. But when the bill come, the small token was actually 15000Won/pax! Even toddler is charged at same price, she just ate some rice!!! We end up paying additional 135000Won for their efforts for 2 hotpot & 2 dishes, on top of our ""live"" seafood purchases. I blamed myself for trusting the guide and not asking for details beforehand. Never had this experience in Ji Long Fish Market in Taiwan (their small token is US$5/dish).STAY AWAY from this place, if you really want to try their ""live"" seafood, learnt from my mistake, ask for bill breakdown before even seating down..."
122,4.0,"We spent a few hours exploring the numerous stalls at Noryanjin Fish Market on New Year's Day.  Most of the vendors were open, though some were closed. TIP: Wear rain boots you don't mind getting fishy as the ground is wet and puddles abound!  It was helpful to have a local Korean help us with negotiating prices.  We walked through once to see what was available, then went back to the vendors we saw with the freshest selections.  First up, we picked out a flat fish for sashimi at 10,000 won/kilo.  A good sized king crab was 75,000 won/kilo and they threw in some smaller cooking crabs as a free gift (service).  We got a dozen or more large prawns and a around the same amount of large clams for 20,000 won. A nice piece of fresh cut salmon was 15,000...a deal since the ajumma thought my daughter was cute, so work the aegyo (acting cute) and get better deals!  We took all the seafood upstairs to a Japanese restaurant where they cooked everything to perfection for 30,000 won (2 soups, baked prawns, baked salmon, steamed crab) and served us ban chan for 3,000 per person.  Such a fun day out and definitely worth the splurge for such fresh seafood."
123,3.0,"This fish market was very impressive - loads of variety of fish to look at. Almost all the stalls offer the same selection though. But it's worth walking around to have a look and the colour and variety available makes for great photos.What we found interesting were the banchan / sauce stalls at the far end which offered a selection of seafood/fish based banchan dishes and authentic fish based sauces/pastes. Sampling is welcomed.Whilst the seafood available is undeniably fresh and plentiful, the cooking services at the restaurants on the 2nd floor were really pricey and definitely tourist-targeted. We decided instead to venture to the town area where regular folk eat...side-street food stalls are plentiful. Kimchi and/or bacon fried rice, Sausage pancakes, etc... this was great fun.To get to the town, just cross over the overhead bridge connected to the market."
124,3.0,"Lots of fresh seafood to choose from but do note, the cooking can be pricey - example , to steam a crab  can cost a high as S$60.00 . But overall a good experience as we dont get to see such market back home"
125,5.0,The fish market is very impressive. Large number of alive fish that you can buy and get cooked in the upper floor. It is one of the most impressive time spend in Seoul^.
126,2.0,"Sells you seafood at a very cheap price but the restaurant that they send you to is very pricey..Had king crab there but it did not taste good. Ate the same thing near  Sungshin Women's Uni, much cheaper, a lot of free side dishes.Felt cheated T.T"
127,1.0,"Prompted by a popular food documentary on Korean food, we went to the market after taking the train. I thought I had gone to the wrong place. The dirt of the place reminds me of a busy fish market in the backwaters of some south east asian village without access to proper drainage, definitely not one u will find in a big city.Have you had the experience when u arrive at a tripadvisor attraction which many TA advisors voted as  ""Very good"" or ""Good"" but you realise it honestly should warrant a ""terrible"" rating ? Well Noryangjin Fish Market is such an place for me (it's not an ""attraction"")Firstly, the unacceptable filth and extremely unhygienic environment. Any responsible TA advisors should warn the community how dirty the market is. The floor is potholed, filled with dirty water. I felt sorry for my shoes (even though they are not brand new). I nearly fainted when I saw the choked drains filled with unspeakable filth. The roof of the restaurants are cluttered with litter (yeah you can see it standing on the second floor where u arrive after crossing the bridge). A section of it was filled with open bags of garbage n styrofoam cups. Remembering it in my mind gives me the shivers now. How can u forget the nauseating sight? U would hv thought they hv some kind of hygiene checks. This place is absolutely not suitable for people to have a meal. Eat at your own risk to your health. It is entirely reasonable to think of rodents and rats infesting such a filthy place.  Beware of dishonest operators of restaurants too."
128,4.0,"We spent the better part of the afternoon at the Noryangjin Fish Market.  It had rained in the morning so we didn't get to the fish market until the afternoon.  Although this is NOT a tourist attraction, if you are visiting Seoul, or here because it's your duty station, you have to go check out the fish market.  We were there with our children, 9 yr old and 3 yr old, and the vendors were very nice to us, always wanted to talk with the kids, give ""high fives"", and one lady even let the kids touch one of the fish in the tank.  By no means is this a tourist attraction, but if you are in the mood for seafood, I would recommend checking out the fish market.  We bought our seafood and cooked it at home.  The fish market does provide the consumer with the option to have the fresh seafood cooked in one of its several restaurants, we opted to take it to our own kitchen.  The seafood was delicious.  If you like muscles, they don't value them all that much and you can score about 5 pounds for about 4 dollars (5,000-6,000KW).  PROS - There is parking and it's cheap, about 3,000KW.  The seafood is as fresh as you are ever going to get it.  The place is huge, so many selections you'll get a headache just trying to choose.  The people are nice, extremely polite and very friendly.  You can haggle the price a little bit but don't push it or you'll get the patented hand wave as if to say they've had enough of dealing with you.  CONS - The smell can be a little overwhelming.  I know what you are thinking, ""what did you expect""?  Yeah, well, just heed the warning.  The prices are a bit steep for specific items.  For shellfish the prices are very reasonable, unless you are talking crab or lobster (you would be better off just going to a restaurant and buying one).  It's not a tourist attraction, it's a fish market, so anything you associate with a tourist attraction, you will not find here.  Well, we are continuing to do Seoul and the Fish Market was todays adventure.  We loved it.  I'm a believer that if you are thinking about going to check a place out, well then you already want to go.  Trust me, if you are a bit curious about heading to the fish market, you have to go."
129,4.0,"We made a trip by metro to this fish market and it was very easy to get there. This is a must not miss ""Things To Do in Seoul"" kinda thing. It's interesting and the best part is you can pick and buy any seafood you want and they will take it to a restaurant round the corner of the market and cook for you!!! Clams palm size, mussels as big as your foot, cockles as big as your fist, octopus and even Alaskan snow crabs, abalones..... All live and fresh and cheap!!! Have the food with beer or so-ju (Korean alcohol) One thing though is make sure you bargain and confirm the sale before they pack for you and take you to the restaurant. Because of the different cooking methods, the price to cook is almost similar to the price of seafood.Overall good experience and good fresh seafood"
130,5.0,"We went there with little expectation but it came out to be brilliant for all of us. Location - There is no sign to the market and the Koreans do not speak english at all. After exit, just get up the staircase, crossing to overhead bridge. Keep walking till you reach to the end of the bridge and turn left down a flight of steps. You will not see the market at all, so just keep walking with this instruction. One flight down, you will see and ""smell"" the market. Price - We didnt know which store to choose, so we chose the one that speak our language, Mandarin. Some stall holders could communicate in Mandarin. Bargain - Not sure of the market price but if you buy big ticket items like king crab, alaska crab etc...be sure to ask for freebies like abalone or octopus.  Dont buy seafood that is not alive, we bought prawns and they turned out to be not fresh.After the purchase,  the stall holder will bring you to a restaurant and I guess that depends on your luck.  The one we went was at the back of the market, need to walk up to the 2nd floor to access the restaurant.  As we were in a group of 13pax, they gave us a private room. They cooked the seafood we bought and we need to pay additional for the cooking. We had a hard time ordering, luckily the chef is a chinese and he helped us. Do ask the staff to use the crab leftover to do a fried rice, that was the most yummy rice I had in korea! We opted for a non spicy seaweed soup and that was fantastic too.Do note we paid about 18k won per pax for the cooking and the service rendered. Afterall,  our family had a great time trying raw seafood, great experience!"
131,5.0,"This place is amazing!! It is like a place with many many aquariums but you get to eat the seafood!! Went there with my kids in Jun '13 and they could not take their eye off the many big crabs, shell fishes and octopus. We tried the raw octopus, sangnakji, and it tasted very good! We purchase a 1.3 kg long leg crab, flounder fish, fresh scallops and sangnakji and only paid total abt 110,000 won. Infact, it is too much for a family with 2 kids. Must get more adults to come along next time to try. Amazing!!"
132,5.0,We came here early one morning to walk around and try not too look like such obvious tourists. It's pretty fascinating how many different types of seafood you'll find here! It's surprisingly clean and the stalls are for the most part pretty well maintained. There are some stalls that will sell sashimi and you can buy fish or other seafood and bring it to one of the few restaurants in the fish market for them to cook. My sister had a restaurant prepare sashimi with a fish she picked out and on this trip we had spicy crab stew. We weren't sure how to pick out great crab and the server told us that crab was in season so she went out and got 4 for us and prepared this off menu dish! If you bring it they'll make it into something tasty for you.We were way too late in the day for the fish auction but as much as I want to see this live I can't muster up the motivation to wake up in the middle of the night to make my way over for this.
133,4.0,"I was there with my family on Friday around noon so not crowded at all. You must bargain for the seafood & try to purchase most of the seafood from one stall for more discounts. The vendor then passed the seafood to staff from one of the restaurants upstairs, so we just followed her. Forgot which restaurant we went, but it was packed mostly with tourists. After telling them what to do with the seafood (sashimi, soup, steam or bbq), we waited & salvaged the food. Food served was quite good. Try these as most recommended: Flounder/ flat fish Í¥ëÏñ¥ for sashimi (flesh) & spicy fish soup 'maeun-tang' (bones), king crab for steam (excellent!), then ask to cook fried rice using crab's shell & eggs, penis fish for sashimi (i heard quite yummy), and of course the famous live baby octopus 'sannakji' is a must try for the bold!"
134,4.0,"Noryangjin Fish Market is a vast fish market under one roof.  Vendors sell different types of fish which is worth a view.  Its definitely worth a visit, but it is also advised to bargain before buying as most of the sellers sell their products at a premum to tourists.Visitors can also buy services from one of the restaurants on Level 1 -- where your fish will be cooked and served with salads and rice -- well it depends upon what service you buy.  Having read a lot of positive views about these restaurants, we visited a restaurant but were not pleased at all.   However if you have a Korean companion, you can be guaranteed to get a better deal.Yes, there are not decent toilets or refresh rooms at the fish market."
