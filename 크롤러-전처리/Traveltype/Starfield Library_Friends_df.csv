All the books are in Korean (duh...) and I found it hard to look for a single English book. But they have a great collection, I supposed...and very Instagrammable too!"
1,5.0,I haven't been to a library with this unique layout. Massive number of books and areas to study and read. It was relatively quiet compared to the amount of people who were passing through. Great place for a book lover!
2,4.0,"Just like pics. Really an impressive place, especially by night with all the lights. Even without stopping to take a book, the library itself make you feel small. A funny thing is that when you go upstairs, there are coffee shops and small stores between the shelves.The COEX Mall in its whole is really a cool place to go shopping!"
3,5.0,"A stunning example of design in this sprawling underground shopping mall. Take time to enjoy the ceiling as well. Such a great place to watch people taking selfies, especially while going up and down the escalators!  Back in the days when I used to buy many books I would have gone sick in this bookshop!"
4,5.0,"Speaking personally, I think that the idea of having a library in the middle of a bustling mall is utterly genius. Starfield library is a perfect place to gather and have a read-fest, or to have your shopping break."
5,5.0,"Booklover's unite! Located in the center of Coex Mall is this dreamy and welcoming place called the Starfield Library. Note that since it is inside a mall, there is a constant hum of noise and activity so it is not like the typical library you may familiar with but it is worth a visit nonetheless. Rounded and lighted bookshelves stretch far above your head and are simply mesmerizing to see. You can sit on the steps below the bookshelves or at any of the various tables located throughout. Pictures do not do this gem justice."
6,4.0,"Excellent for photo-taking! Most of the books were in Korean so we could not understand it at all. Nonetheless, the library itself was beautiful and we ended up taking many pictures there."
7,4.0,Stumbled across this place when I visited SMTown Museum. It's really great for photo-taking opportunity

11,5.0,"What a gem in the middle of a huge mall. Books as far as the eye can see. Plenty of seating, no lying down allowed. Books not only in Korean but other languages as well. I enjoyed sitting, reading and watching people walk by. a great place to spend an hour or so."
12,4.0,"As a tourist attraction, I can say that the library is quite stunning. However as a person who has worked at a library and has spent over a decade studying in one, I cannot see how this is a place where you can concentrate reading anything with people talking  & texting on their cell phones, tourists coming and going."
13,5.0,"This place is a heaven to bookworm like me. but as far as i see, (but please cmiiw) the books only available in korean. but you know this place is amazing.."
14,2.0,"There are korean books, English magazines and chairs to sit in and read. There was piano music from loudspeakers. Not very good  loudspeakers and not very good piano music either. Any one can enter and read. The photos people publish make it look larger than it is. The ceiling is very high but I have seen many libraries that are larger than this. It is a good place to sit and read if you are in the coex mall and need a place to sit and reed. Not worth a detour at all, though."
15,4.0,"This place is crowded but captivating. You can actually read the books on the shelves! Some people sit there for a bit while reading or doing some work, but the majority are just passing by.It's nice to see if you're in the mall, if you're lucky enough you'll be able to sit and rest for a bit."
16,5.0,"What an amazing place. I was dumbstruck to see inside this mall is a huge library with at the corner, a singer was singing on a small stage. You must make it a point to visit this place and you will be clicking away taking photos of the amazing views of the books arranged up to the ceiling."
17,5.0,This place is picture perfect and instagram worthy. Photographers and bloggers will love this place.
