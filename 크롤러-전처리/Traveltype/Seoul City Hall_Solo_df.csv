0,4.0,"Apparently, there are 2 City halls, the new and old. The old city hall is now a Seoul Metropolitan Library while the new city hall, which is next to it, is a modern impressive architecture. They are located in front of the Seoul Plaza, a large open space field. I passed by here on my way to Deoksugung Palace."
1,4.0,"A new ultra-modern city hall has been built and opened in just the past 5-6 years, and is located behind the older original (and Japanese-designed) City Hall. The older City Hall has now been converted into a library.The new City Hall is located behind, and slightly to the right of, the earlier building, and its sweeping facade appears to curve upwards and almost leaning over the much smaller and earlier building. This IS an impressive building, both from the outside, as well as its interiors, which include a gigantic main wall of glass right across the front of the building, and an internal greenery wall of plants that seems to soar ever so high up above you. In front of the two City Halls (the old and the new...) is the huge City Hall Plaza. This open space seems to be used for a variety of public events, outdoor exhibitions, food expos etc. There was a seafoods suppliers exhibition being held at one edge of the large plaza on the day we visited, which gave us an opportunity to sample a couple of seafood plates.Well worth a visit, and do ENSURE that you don't just view the new City Hall from the outside, but DO go inside and take in the impressive architecture of this building.You could probably spend upwards of an hour checking out the plaza and new City Hall, but if there is an interesting event being held on the plaza then you might find you can spend much longer there."
2,3.0,"The City Hall, just a short walk from the City Hall metro station, is a beautiful building. However, I would like to mention that in autumn, please do not miss the stone wall adjacent to Exit 1 of the station. It is a scenic spot for portrait photography."
3,5.0,"As an architecture buff, I found Seoul's City Hall to be a most worthwhile stop. The modern 13-story glass-and-steel building opened in 2012 behind the old, stone city hall, now a library. Designed by You Kerl, the new building resembles a huge wave but borrows from elements of traditional Korean houses, such as the roof structure. Eco friendly, its features include a geothermal plant and rainwater for the cooling system.Home for city government offices, the building also welcomes the general public for free in many areas. I started on the first floor and marveled at the vertical garden that climbs the inner wall to the seventh floor. Consisting of tens of thousands of plants, the garden was the largest in the world when the building opened. Its lower part, which I could see clearly, however, needs to have brown leaves removed. An art installation, ""Metaseosa Seobeol,"" appears just inside the entrance by the garden. Its myriad white balloons represent Seoul's turbulent history, but the creation reminded me of giant grapes. I took the glass elevator to the ninth-floor cafe, where artwork was displayed. Many people sat at small tables, drinking coffee or looking at phones. Two locals invited me to join them and shared many interesting stories about their city and its history.Later, I descended to the basement level's multipurpose space, which includes art exhibitions and design shops. I especially liked the glassed-in archaeology hall that exhibits items from the Joseon dynasty found during excavation of the site. A visitor information desk at this level had an English-speaking woman, who gave me details about the area in general. Seoul City Hall offers a convenient stop for those visiting nearby Deoksugung Palace. The building is at the City Hall metro stop."
4,4.0,"The original Seoul City Hall, built in 1925 is an example of Imperial Crown Style architecture and served as city hall until 2008. It is now the Seoul Metropolitan Library. It is completely overshadowed by the imposing new City Hall which is often described as looking like a tsunami made of glass and steel. I was staying at the Plaza hotel just across the square so I saw it both by day and by night in all its glory. And at night it was very colourful indeed, changing colours what appeared to be every few minutes. And by day it seemed to attract all sorts of protesters making noisy demonstrations about a range of mainly local issues. In fact in the week I stayed in this city one gets a very strong impression that Koreans like to shout, wave banners and generally make a lot of noise. Thank goodness that my hotel room had good sound protection. By the way, in the basement of the City Hall are a number of nice exhibitions, some of which I could vaguely understand..."
5,4.0,"The Seoul City Hall was just a 5-10 minute walk from my hotel. I walked by it several times, but never stopped in. Unfortunately, today is a Monday and most tourist attractionsare closed in Seoul on Mondays and so was the visit of the City Hall. Hence, I could only see the lobby area and got my self some documentation. The 'Tong Tong Tour', a Self- Guided Tour, looks very interesting to me. It goes over most floors of the City Hall. I will certainly do this during my next visit!"
6,5.0,I am a huge sci fi and futurism fan and loved this building and architecture. It could be out of an Interstellar-esque space station. Despite it being very cold outside the inside feels like a warm garden. The lush plants and clean crisp architectural lines make this a photographer's paradise. Take the glass lift up to the platform where the coffee shop is to get an excellent view.Stunning and a must visit for architecture and sci fi fans. However note the art gallery supposedly on floor 7 appears currently defunct/neglected.
7,5.0,"When we try to explain Seoul City Hall, we have to consider other components. The location of the City Hall is perfect and if you like walking you can find temples, museums, sculptures etc. around there. I highly recommend  to go there guys!"
8,4.0,"Seoul City Hall is an amazing building that is architecturally a marvel to look at. Seoul City Hall was built in 1926. There is an open green area by the City Hall. Various events and festivals are held here. It is also a nice place to have a picnic. The Seoul Plaza is a very significant historic site. It is also serves as a gathering place for football fans â€“ as was the case during the 2002 World Cup that was jointly held by Japan and S. Korea. There is a monument with a clock counting down to the winter Olympics of 2018 in Pyeong Chang.  One of the attractions of Seoul Plaza is the Floor Water Fountain, which looks like a normal sidewalk but shoots water up very high from the floor when you walk across it. The 48 floor lights along the grass square and Fala- a round type outer wall clock- are other attractive features of the Square. The Fala, in particular, is designed to ring the Boshingak Belfry sound at high noon everyday. The Floor Water Fountain presents a grand sight with 35 underwater lights.Admission is free"
9,3.0,Super modern building. Great outside architecture.  Inside has a vertical garden. Very modern very Seoul. Definatley worth checking out. City Hall metro station
10,4.0,Seoul City Hall is an eco friendly building with unique exterior. The Green Wall is the most popular attraction at the Seoul City Hall building. The vertical garden climbs up the inner wall all the way from first floor to the seventh floor.
11,5.0,Come to take an exterior photograph. Amazing how the old and new sit well together.  Around outside the space comes alive. Very easy to reach by metro. Railway station worth combining a visit.
12,3.0,"It is just a office building. It is one of Seoul's landmark, is an eco-friendly building with the world's largest indoor green wall. There is a big lot right in front of the city hall. Sometimes they use it for different kind of outdoor events. The city hall is right across street from Deoksugung Palace."
13,3.0,"Nothing too special. I've been to the Seoul City Hall many times throughout my life. In my opinion, the new building they added a few years ago just doesn't look right. It's a cool modern building but it doesn't look in harmony with the older buildings. The Seoul City Hall is not the same anymore. During the winter, they have a ice-skating rink and they decorate the area with a huge Christmas tree and lights. They also had an open market a couple years ago which had many booths of food and gifts to buy."
14,5.0,"great place to hang out with friends, picnic possible in front of the building, many events happen there, check website."
15,4.0,"Very modern building near Myeoung Dong. It is locates next to Seoul Library which is old style building and therefore, creates very eye catching point for photo."
16,4.0,"C1 ( 2016.07.29 )There was modern style beautiful building in downtown as public office. This building's underground had rest area, museum, library for citizen. If you visited downtown, recommend to look around this public office. There had not classical mood different with Europe's old office, but modern mood was not bad."
17,5.0,"Amazing place! You get to see seouls past, present and future with fantastic views, libraries, amazing architecture, amazing cafes and a public space designed for the citizens of Seoul to converge."
18,5.0,Beautiful setting of a park with lawn and space for festivals and gatherings.  Dramatic sweeping lines of glass that is lit at night so it looks completely different than the perspective you see in the daylight.
19,5.0,You can see this building from quite a long way away. It looks like a big rolling wave made of glass.  If it is a sunny day be sure to take your sun glasses for the reflection is dazzling.
20,4.0,"The old and new city halls are worth a short stop on your way through the city center. The new one is quite spectacular  with its internal gardens and spaceship architecture. In addition there are exhibition at ground level and  basement (some archeological remains in the foundation of the building), however the latter seemed to be the target of numerous visiting groups of classes that made the place quite noisy! Anyway a quick look only takes a short while and is easily made on your way to anywhere around."
21,4.0,There are old and new buildings around the City Hall which is very central district in Seoul. There was an icing ring when I was there.  I actually walked to City Hall from Myeongdong.
22,5.0,"Seeing a green building up close is like dreaming of a future filled with hope and order. While the glass and steel facade can stiffen the building , the moment you get inside and see the vertical plants alive and green , plus some art installations, you get to see the balance of a building that is well thought about and designed. Another must see and visit in Seoul downtown."
23,4.0,"I stumbled upon Seoul City Hall during Christmastime and was pleasantly surprised and quite impressed with its architectural design, both inside and outside. During the winter, there is a ice skating rink right in front with tall Christmas tree which could be romantic, but also fun for kids.Inside, there are sections that are strictly for workers there, but there are also many areas for the public to visit. When you first step in, there is an enormous wall of green vines faced by the glass wall of the building. There are some hanging bubble-like sculptures that light up at night. Quite beautiful. There are some artsy shops and cafes and a bookstore inside. There is a sci-fi-looking video wall where kids can play some video games. There is a miniature museum that shows an excavation site (I think of what they found maybe beneath the construction site of this city hall? Can't remember...) Apparently, there are free concerts from time to time (I didn't see one, but I did see the small stages and seating areas). There are some interesting looking conference rooms that are quite grandiose. It's actually quite hard to describe as it is such a mix of everything.I would like to eventually return when I have more time to explore it more fully or to even take a tour of the building."
24,3.0,Take a quick peak inside the City Hall Building. There is not a lot to see here but make sure you take the lift to the 9th floor and then walk down to the 8th floor.
25,4.0,"Hello friends, when you visit Seoul,South Korea make it a point to take a leisurely walk around Seoul CITY HALL,it is easily reachable by TAXI,bus and metro train lines number 1 and 2.The OLD City Hall , a Victorian Like structure building and the new modern 21st Century Jazzy Shaped Glass looking like a Theater stand side by side.  In the front are large open SUN WARMED spaces- a public Ice Skating Rink,UNICEF Tent Pavilion and Cafeteria.But what impressed me the most is that a LOVELY red & white color model of an EAR named YEOBOSEYO in Korean which means Communication! The message to public is loud and clear that ""we CITY Councillors are Listening to Citizens"". Good Luck."
26,5.0,"The city hall is located nearby many touristic attractions of Seoul. The building is quite big and imposing, in the way you can't miss noticing it. When I visited an ice skating rink was being built right in front of it. The square was also well decorated for Christmas."
27,5.0,The old City Hall is incrusted in a large modernistic glass and steel building. It stands out. It reflects the wealth and the good taste of the people of Seoul. It did not hurt that I saw it on a bright sunny day. Excellent access by metro and bus (incl. tourist busses).
28,3.0,The architecture of this building is very interesting. There are always concerts or similar events in its yard. It is good to check the place from time to time.
29,3.0,"I'm fairly impressed by the beauty of Seoul, a combination of tradional characteristic and modern beauty"
