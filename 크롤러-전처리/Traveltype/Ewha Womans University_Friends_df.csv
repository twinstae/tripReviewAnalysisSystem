I agree the students are to some extent, are disturbed by visitors, especially the tourists from all over the world.  I would suggest visitors just touring the outside of the buildings and have a walk around the area near their famous library."
15,3.0,"One of the spots for modern architecture tour.  Ewha has its sunken campus by French Architect Dominique Perrault. Don't miss out Sun Tower by American Architect, Morphosis, which is just along the road outside the campus at the west.The campus is a pleasant place for a leisure walk. Recommend not to spend too much time especially this is in fact a campus where tourists cause disturbance.The district is small. The shops around Ewha are those not of prime quality but prices are competitive. It is nice idea to try a haircut in Korean style especially for girls."

24,5.0,"We had a really fun time at this place! Don't bother eating before coming, there are plenty of interesting cafes and street stalls here. You could easily eat your way up and down the streets and around the university. The shopping is mostly for young people's things like fashion bags / clothes and stuff. Take the train to Ewha Women's University station and there will be signs on where to exit. We came from exit 7 and ate our way down to the university and back. Despite being a sunday, it was not crowded and there were no street performances. But for us, we were looking for a chill time so it kinda fit our mood anyways. Good to go if you have the time :)"

27,4.0,"Very similar to the shopping in the Hongik University area in Hongdae but a bit smaller.  Depending what you are shopping for, you may find bargains there as well. It's worth a visit to compare the difference.  Personally, I like the Hongdae area better."
28,5.0,"That long pathway is a refreshing sight! It's a picture perfect place so not having that selfie and jumpshot would be a pity! And the food at the canteen inside one of those glass walls are superb, yummy and cheap! Go try them out!"

Definitely a place to visit at least once.

34,4.0,"Mins walk from Ewha Woman Univ. subway, Exit 1.  The whole street mostly filled up by coffee house, boutique, selling casual wear.  I targeted on casual wear and the pricing between KRW 5,000 to KRW 10,000.  However, there is no trying on these casual wear and mostly are T-shirts, blouses, short pants/dress.  I was able to grab some to be my souvenir and happy with the purchased."

I visited this uni twice already and surely will bring my friends/family there during my next trip!"
49,5.0,"The campus is simply beautiful as it was designed by French architect, Dominique Perrault. You can take many amazing photographs here. The shopping street is also great and you can get good buys, even for men. It is also accessible via metro (alight at Ehwa Women's University)"

55,5.0,"Honestly I had seen a documentary on the newest part of Ewha campus and I was interested, so I naturally visited. The newest part built by Dominique Perrault Architecture is impressive and enchanting. It somehow beckons you to come and explore more of the university grounds. If you love architecture and want to see how an addition to an old campus works wonderfully - visit. Even if you aren't that interested around Ewha are wonderful shops and places to get a great outfit."
56,5.0,"I am pleased that Korean women were able to get an education due to Lulu E Frey. I enjoyed the history, architectural and culture element today. There are a few good pieces in the Museum and the one on filial piety caught my eyes. The renovations of the university grounds took a long while. The modern lines complimented the old building very well."

Some store owners are friendly and will let you haggle down the prices. Most of the clothing are of one size though but there are stores which cater to tourists and sell larger sizes. You can get the trendiest clothing from here for a very good price! Stores do not stay open until late because it's a student area!"

62,5.0,I did not expect that this is an attraction aside from the market near the university. I suppose that it's not only students who come here often but also those who want to buy in the market and those who want to see the aesthetic beauty of this university.

Ewha Womans University is one of the prestigious universities in South Korea.We visited the place because its such an awesome campus.
65,4.0,"This university is specially catered to girls and women. It is open to public and there is a beautiful garden (not sure it is as it does looks like one to me) at the centre of the compound where you can take a walk around, taking pictures etc. Along the way to the campus, there are rows of shops that sell fashion apparels, bags, accessories, cosmetics and street food too. The things there are relatively cheap maybe it is near the school. Good place to shop around (though area not big) if you are looking for fashionable stuff."

68,5.0,"I was in awe of the beauty of this place. Also jealous of the students who get to study in this beautiful place! Best to come during winter, where the sky is blue and you can take nice photos. You can shop and checking out the fashion street, with plenty of selections for clothes, cosmetics and dessert cafe. We are not sure why majority of the tourist would not visit here, but it's definitely a must & highly recommended for me, at least in my opinion!"
69,4.0,"I stayed in a hostel less than 3 minutes away from Ewha Woman University main gate, and it is a great place to stay. There are a lot of clothes shops arround the streets, and a lot of delicious food. The university is also really pretty, but there is nothing much to see if you are not a fan of arquitecture"

72,4.0,"It's a great place to shop for clothes, bags and accessories! I find that the clothes here are sold a reasonable cheaper price than those at Dongdaemun and Myeongdong for similar or same designs (Please don't buy clothes at Myeongdong as they will rip you off - the only thing you should buy there is cosmetics) However, I suppose the clothes here will be more suitable for girls of 18-25 years old - if you are going for the Korean girl college look! There are also several shops which sells handmade bags at around 10000 KRW. It's really affordable to shop here!"
73,2.0,"If you're fan of K-reality show so yes, otherwise, see know reason to visit, feel free to skip this spot & head straight to Hongik statio, where definitely more fun & happenings."

77,5.0,"We didn't actually go to the university, we just went for the shopping and the food! Originally we went there for the bagel place in the evening, which is conveniently also located next to Annie's Pretzels (delicious). We ended up coming back the next day because we liked the area so much and wanted to shop more. The clothes and accessories are cute and the shopkeepers are not as pushy as other, more popular shopping places. You can't haggle at all places (usually the bigger stores) but the prices were generally quite cheap. After shopping I retired to Angelinus cafe which was very comfortable and had a nice view of the street. Overall my favourite shopping experience in Seoul."
78,5.0,Visited in winter again and went there at least 3 days during my entire trip. The street food were the best my friend and I have eaten during this trip that we found ourselves going back there just to eat. Shopping was good and cheap too.

This place also full with cafes, restaurants and street food vendors."

82,5.0,"Love the shopping street here and all the cafes, Prices for shopping here is good too as compared to shopping at Myeongdong shopping area and also it is less crowded here.

84,5.0,"A great spot for photography and capturing the alluring beauty of red autumn leaves just before winter beckons. The cathedral, long flight of stairs, spacious grounds is a good change after some shopping."
85,3.0,"I would advise tourists to visit during weekends as the university is in operation and it is for students, definitely NOT for tourists.It is sad to see the school has turned into a tourists' selfie ground."

Do take note that they don't want visitors to disturb their students, so do follow their rules when you are there. There are also shops opposite the university. Do walk around this area and enjoy the view."
93,4.0,"I came from Singapore but none of our universities (be it National University of Singapore or Nanyang Technological University) are located within very close proximity from a shoppers' paradise but both Hongik University and Ewha Womans University in Seoul are surprisingly and amazingly within the radius and close proximity of a modern shopping belt. Probably, there are research studies that revealed that undergraduates perform better when they are able to relieve their exam stress and anxiety through window shopping. While in Seoul, I stayed at BoA guesthouse; Hongik University and Ewha Womans University were within walking distance from the guesthouse. I took about 40 mins to walk to Ewha Womans University. I had read that Ewha Womans University is one of the top most prestigious universities in South Korea and the world's largest women educational institute. The university was built in 1886 by an American female Methodist missionary who named it `Ewha' which means `pears in blossom' after noticing a number of pear trees at the campus site. Among the many graduands were Former First Lady of South Korean Presidents.   I took a walk around the campus and found the `American colonial' architectural style of the campus buildings amazing. The `foreign flavor' of the campus setting gave an impression that the university is located in America . The garden landscape around the campus was well manicured and beautiful. The environment was peaceful and tranquil and very conducive for learning. The sculpture of the female American Methodist missionary was also erected near the entrance building. I have great respect for such a lady whose contribution had benefited millions of women in South Korea. South Korea inherited Confucianism from Ancient China and the doctrine of this philosopher demonstrated little respect for the advancement of women's education in feudal society. The Sage equates the status of women to that of the `mean Man' whom he had difficulties in handling them. It was surprising that the South Korean authority permitted the founder to open such a private higher institute of learning solely for women in the 19th century when Confucianism still enjoyed great status in South Korea. Today South Korea, even the President is a lady. South Korean women now enjoys equal status as men. The emancipation movement for woman would not have achieved the intended results without the great contribution of people like this founder of Ewha Womans University, Mary F Scranton, who champions for the right of women to attain and achieve higher academic excellence. The area around the university is a great place to shop and Ewha Womans University is a great University!"

103,2.0,"I'm not sure why anyone other than prospective students would come here. The surrounding area is no different than any other college campus neighborhood. There are some nice shops and some decent restaurants so if you're in Seoul long term then the area is nice to hang out. If you're visiting for a short trip, There's nothing really special here. If you're here to gawk at college girls then you're probably a perv and I've nothing to say to you. (IMO, they're not any more attractive than college girls anywhere else in Seoul)"
104,4.0,"Women's right have been quite strong and reputable in this university. Many students eho have joined this cause are women which bring pride and ego to the university.

There are a cafe and Kyobo bookstore at the Ewha Campus Complex making this a one-stop centre to have a feel of what it’s like being an E-dae student. With the beautiful and unique architecture of the academic buildings, this is one of the places where one may wish to be her alma mater. I do not think I mind studying or doing assignments in the university compound with the beautiful view and beautiful weather."
109,3.0,It is a smaller shopping street as compared to Hongik University but you can still find some good bargain items. Not a must visit but no harm coming if you have the time. Two hours is sufficient.

117,5.0,Huge campus area with beautifully kept grounds and buildings. A must visit for korean drama fans and also an iconic area for taking photographs.
118,5.0,The school was very pretty. The famous complex is prettier in real life than pictures. scenery of the campus is pretty as well. It's like a school somwhere in Europe. Great that tourists are allowed to go in.
119,4.0,"this is a must to go place if you ever travel in Seoul. the scenery there is superb beautiful, like a wallpaper, how I wish I could study in such a beautiful place!!! wish to visit it again in different season."
120,3.0,"It was the shopping stop for my friends and I as it is famed for the pricing of clothes in the area.  Well, I'd add that it really depends as we were able to find similar priced items in other areas such as Dongdaemun, where you can bargain...Fashion there is simple/ casual to suit the university students, hence if you are looking for work clothes, you can actually give it a miss."
121,4.0,"The university grounds were lovely with a small park on either side of a grand walkway...beautiful flowers as it was spring time and very generous of the campus to allow visitors to enjoy the space.Outside of the university is a small neighborhood filled with hair salons, eateries and fashion shops with seriously affordable fashion as it caters to students.Went to get a haircut at Cecica hair salon. Excellent skills and affordable( cuts from about 25,000 won). Would thoroughly recommend them.One for the girls!"
122,5.0,"Old European styled school buildings surrounded by lots of good restaurant, nice coffee shop and you can find lots of affordable shopping here too!"
123,3.0,"This place became famous because of some Korean TV series that I don't watch.  Well, if you have been to Oxford, everything else pales in comparison.  Its the shopping and street snacks around here that are more interesting."
124,4.0,"The campus was very nice- especially the steps to their library. I spent little time in the campus itself, just a few photo stops. However, there was an abundance of shops near the university so spend some time wondering around after visiting the university!"
125,4.0,"Very big and nice campus. The buildings are very modern which can blended with the old one. Around the campus is full of shops, cafe, restaurants, etc. Come to visit after 11 am. is better."
126,4.0,"It was not my first time in Ehwa but it was my first time to enter the University proper. You can go inside to one of their buildings. Yeah, you read it right! They have information building in the entrance. They will give you map and overviews about the university. :D We were not able to stroll around the campus as at that time there were snow flakes and wind from time to time (first snow in Seoul). It was so cold to resist so, we cannot go to an open area. It is a very beautiful campus (grounds plus their buildings architecture) and I believe in the school's integrity! I want to study there!"
127,5.0,"The shopping and restaurants here are extremely cheap since it's catered to college students. You'd find ""college food"" items like bab burgers which was a really interesting take on America's fast food and it's cheap too!"
128,3.0,"Beautiful campus but I m not sure if it worth coming all the way to visit the university when there is so much to see in Seoul. The walk along the way is interesting with fashion shops and street food. Did not manage to visit the campus' interior as unless it' s like Cambridge or Oxford with historic buildings and artefacts, In short, don t think the visit here has much to offer to foreign tourists. Shopping along the way (Fashion Street Erwa U) may be the better reason as to why you may want to be here."
129,4.0,The shop around Ewha University is very kind to your pocket. You can find the same quality with cheaper price. Recommended !
130,5.0,"This place is beautiful! The university is so beautiful that makes me want to enrol here and study again. The area around the university is all street shops and eateries.It's a perfect place to spend an afternoon here, starting from lunch to shopping, cafe for tea and shopping again... This is one of my Must go for every of my trip to Seoul!~"
131,4.0,Ewha is an asset to the whole of Korean society and many of its' past alumni have transformed Korean Society for the better of all the population of the Peninsula. Would Korean Society have made the progress it has without the example of the graduates of this University.
132,5.0,"Been here for the International Co-Ed Summer School in 2014, and i fell in love with the campus immediately upon seeing it. The scenery at the entrance was breathtaking, and is one of the tourist obligation photo spots too. Just outside the campus, you will find streets and streets of shops/restaurants so there is really no reason to leave this place empty handed. Bags are sold at 10,000 Won in most of the shops, and no bargaining needs to be done too. In short, this area has almost everything you can find from head to toe. Lastly, the Alchon Restaurant is a must-try if you're in the area as they sell cheap and VERY NICE albab (similar to bibimbap except that it’s with fish roe)!"
133,3.0,"The campus should be very big and famous of its beautiful scenery whenever there is autumn/winter season.  Though it's a rainy day, we still took a picture at the turnabout near the entrance.  Totally understand it's very annoying when a campus is packed with tourists and it will affect the students there, so as a well-behaviored tourist, we didn't go inside campus.Very envy the students of Ewha Womans U.~"
134,4.0,"If you had to visit one and only one university in Korea, it would be Ewha. The first reason is that despite being close to the center of the city, Ewha is hillside, so it features nice perspectives, slopes and trees surrounding the campus. Secondly, it's one of the countries oldest universities and has many Collegiate Gothic buildings (or as I call them, ""Hogwarts buildings""). Thirdly, the campus's landmark is the heart of the campus, the ""Valley"" that serves as the student and administrative building. This brand new building litteraly flips upside down our conceptions of what a building is. Architecture fans will be delighted, and those unaware of what this building even is will find themselves in awe. But the campus is not just a campus, it sits in the middle of the Sinchon student neighborhood (due to its proximity with Yonsei and Sogang universities). You'll find tons of restaurants, shops, bars and boutiques. Since Ewha is a Women's University, the closer you get to Ewha's entrance, the more girl-orientated boutiques you'll find (beauty parlors, clothing,...)."
135,3.0,it was winter and shops were generally selling the same things. Street food was varied and good experience to buy and snacked like the locals.
136,5.0,"Universities are judged and ranked according to academics and publications and what not, but I make this judgement call on the beauty of the campus and the students. I swear, there is a beauty scale that is used when admitting students because so many of them are so drop dead gorgeous...that aside, because of the heavy western influence of the building of the campus, many of them are very beautiful and statuesque. The campus itself is on a very hilly terrain so you'll enjoy the sights of pretty much everything."
137,5.0,"This is the first place where I came in Seoul and it was the love from the first sight. Beautiful and big campus, mixture of historical and modern architecture, offers you everything that student needs: convenient dormitory, modern library with all facilities, even sleeping room, several coffeeshops, canteen and restaurants, gym etc.  Perfect location, for fashion addicted ones, there are a lot of shops nearby; for party lovers, it is just next to Sinchon, which is next to Hongdae:)"
138,5.0,"The university houses a Ewha Campus Complex (Basement level 6 – 1st Floor) which is Korea’s largest underground campus. The lower levels contain a library, bookstore, gym, movie theater, cafes, and other cultural facilities, while on the first level visitors can find lecture rooms and an eco-park.The campus is so beautiful"
139,4.0,"This famous and unique architecture buildings of the campus has attracted a lot of tourists to visit.Short saying, this university famous not only for the education but also as tourist attraction in Seoul"
140,4.0,This is introduced as a Tourist spot in most books. But the University recently had a big sign made that says that they are not a tourist spot. The entrance was nicely done and the steps made me recalled a few Korean Drama that was filmed there.
141,5.0,"Super huge breathtaking campus of imposing brick wall buildings coupled with the modernity of sky high glass domes. Filled with little quaint pebbled paths leading to individual faculties and places, accompanied by rows of pretty flora fauna, and lots of green green greenery on the way. Good positive atmosphere and definitely a joy to visit.Not to mention the fact that you will be able to see many pretty noonas too!"
142,2.0,"It was an okay place to learn Korea part time. Not the best. The first teacher I had was AWESOME. The second one, was terrible and lazy. So it really depends. But the text books were not colored and I didn't like the format of the class much. Plus, I had a hard time understanding what the heck was going on. Also, the tutor they gave me was very unmotivated and seemed to resent me for asking a lot of questions about the language. She seemed more interested in her boyfriend, so I didn't want to seek her help again. So again, I didn't have a very good experience there."
143,4.0,"I was reluctant to go here at first, but thank God I did. The university was absolutely stunning modern architecture. The garden was great, real serene. Just outside the university, there is a street dedicated for shopping. Everything from lady's shoe to cosmetic could be easily spotted. But the main attraction of course is the university itself. It is worth taking a detour and visit this university."
144,5.0,"go there if you want to witness top of the art architecture both in buildings and students. go visit the main alley and the historical building, don't miss the park and the hills"
145,4.0,"It is worth going, just following the crowd from MRT and you will be there.  Very nice place to go for viewing."
146,4.0,"Walk from the subway to the entrance and have a glimpse of how students access retail.  Be amazed at the ""campus valley"".  Walk up on the green roof then turn around and walk down the steps.  There's supposed to be an interesting side street, which I missed."
147,4.0,The famous spot of EWU is the ECC square where most the student gather at the two side of the building. The street outside is more interesting for shopping and food hunt.
148,4.0,This place is accessible by train. There are also a lot of shops and street food vendors that you will pass by going to the University. The merchandise are also relatively cheaper here compared to Myeongdong so I suggest you do your actual shopping here to be able to maximize your money. What I like about this place is the architecture of the buildings. My friend studies at the university and she was able to bring us inside the buildings. Their school is picturesque and good for taking those touristy photos.
149,4.0,"Stuff sold here is pretty much the same as what they sell in Myeongdong, except it's cheaper. Half my suitcase was empty when I went to Korea. It became full from just one shopping trip here. The quality of the stuff aint the best, but for that price, it's worth it, even if you wear the stuff once or twice for fun.Although there are fewer options of street food here compared to Myeongdong, in general, it's cheaper here."
150,4.0,"If you are a college or uni student, Ewha Woman University is definitely the best place for you to go for a shopping and get the best price for stuffs like shoes, sandals, women clothes, Korean made handbags etc compared to Myeongdong street. Other than that, you also can find various cutie and trendy women fashion clothes with different styles, which you can negotiate the best price for them. Located near to Hongdae, Ewha Woman University offers you more women clothes and stuffs rather than men stuffs. So you still can drop by at Hongdae for men stuffs after you done your shopping in Ewha Uni. Amazingly, in Ewha Uni you can get quality handbags and cardigans for only 10 000 won. So, no regrets if you are a student and love to shop ! This is the place you are looking for ~"
151,4.0,"Being near a university (and a women’s one no less), the area around it is known as Ewha Woman's University Fashion Street. So expect lots of shops (and departmental stores) selling clothes, accessories, cafés, skincare, beauty salons and shoes – all catered to the preferences of young women. One of the good things is that the products sold here are pretty affordable (with majority of the clientele being students). But while the clothes are affordable, the quality of the cloth is literally what you pay for, so don’t expect the clothes that you bought to last you a long time (they just aren’t made that way - well most of them anyways). Anyways, aside from the many skincare shops (Faceshop, Etude, Tony Moly, Holika Holika etc...) scattered along this area, what stands out about this place is that the clothes sold tend to be of a feminine/sweet style or earthy/hippie-style with a tinge of vintage. Shopping aside, if you have the time and energy, walking to and around the university campus itself is a good photo opportunity with all the pretty flowers in bloom and very conducive studying environment.This is one area I would be wiling to go back to visit again as the place is massive: a day to roam the streets and alleys is simply not enough. Yes, we spent almost a whole day exploring what Ewha Woman's University Fashion Street had to offer, and we had only scratched the surface. Definitely worth going back for another visit! Do check out my blog for more about the experience and photos! :)"
152,4.0,"Most people stroll the university and go home but there is a small market place to the side of the university. Look and ask around. Loads of cute quite affordable stuff to buy. Food, bags, socks, kimchi, keychains...etc. we almost didnt do the market but thanks to our Lonely Planet book, we lookes around a bit."
153,5.0,"There are a lot of shops that sells cheap clothes, shoes and accessories near Ewha Womens University. Targeting at university students, the shops there has become popular among the young generation. There are also pretty good cafes around to chill or just reading a book to kill time. You can also find quite a number of salon if you plan you get a Korean style haircut. The University itself is also a good place to take a good photo with the long flight of stairs near the entrance as the back drop."
154,4.0,"The Ewha Womans University area is one of the most popular shopping districts in Seoul. Clothing stores in the area sell affordable and stylish fashions for young people. Restaurants in the area cater to the tastes of young women, and many international dining chains have branches here. But we were attracted to all the street food and ate all of them. After all, a really nice area to shop for youngsters and many local street food to snack on! Beware, preapre to spent a bomb here :XYou can read more details w photos on my blog at http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/07/seoul-korea-day-4-insadong-sinchon-ewha.htmlThanks! x"
155,4.0,My friend and I were shopping around the streets of Edae and decided to pay this university a visit. It was during the afternoon so there were quite a number of students walking around. The campus is really beautiful so you could just drop by to take a couple of pictures while shopping in Edae.
156,5.0,"the university has a good location with full of shops, stalls, cafes and restaurants along the road. the unique about this university is the architecture of the entrance building. its build inside the small hill. a great place to further study."
157,4.0,"When we were in Seoul, we took a cab to the area near this University. It was another great choice for shopping.There were also restauranst and cafe if one just want to sit and watch do crowd watching. there were many local students and ine can just be awe with the korea fashion scene.There were stores in the mall which we did not find very good. Most stores are just shops along the street. The sizes are concern as they are pretty small. However, if you want T shirt, it is fine. Prices are very cheap US$5 to $15. Just spend a half day here if you like to look at local life and shop cheaply.Koreans are very friendly and helpful.We will definitely plan another trip to Korea this year."
158,3.0,"I am currently studying Korean at nearby Yonsei University, so I have been to Ewha WU a few times with my friends.  Although the campus is cozy and nice, for those who are accumstomed to campuses in Canada or the US, Korean campuses do not exude particular charm.  Most buildings look smaller ersatz versions of gothic style.  I was not allowed to enter the library so I cannot comment on inside.The nearby surroundings are typical of Korean colleges:  boutique shops, small eateries, cafes.  If your itinerary allows you only a few days in Seoul, I would actually recommend you to skip this one."
159,4.0,This Uni is known as Edae to the locals. I'm Singaporean & I was delighted to see a Kopitiam selling local Kopi here. Try the street food here too esp the Chicken skewers. Check out the Campus & buy souvenirs at the Lifestyle store Kosney.
160,5.0,"This place is awesome..no scratch that,AMAZEBALLS, my friend studied in Ewha, so she gave us a tour, the place was huge, it connects you to the past and present, the old building was very well maintained, just..wow!"
161,5.0,"when i thought korea clothes would be very expensive, i was so wrong. visited seoul in july and almost the entire streets of ewha womans university was on sale. skincare shops, clothes & shoes shops, there's so much to buy! hongdae is cheap but ewha is cheaper! the area is packed with students and tourists. the university is also very beautiful. start shopping at ewha before hongdae, myeong dong and dongdaemun. you'll get the best prices there."
162,5.0,beautiful campus. you may find some great small boutiques around the campus.
163,4.0,"The campus design itself is outstanding. They cut the hill to make ways for a-five-floors rooms consist of class rooms, library and even gym !!! Amazing architecture design. and don't forget to shop in surrounding area full with cute 'girly' merchandise such as cosmetics, apparel, stationary as well as cafe and eating place. Must visit."
