7,4.0,Fantastic art takes the shape of an all glass tidal wave building eclipsing the old Japanese built city hall
8,3.0,There's not much to see other than a cool building that's shaped like a wave. Take some pictures and wander on by. Sometimes there are protests outside of here which can be interesting but other than a picture it isn't worth a special trip.
9,5.0,The new Seoul City Hall captures the modern archetecture theme very prevalent throughout the city. The facade features a huge screen and rounded glistening curves. The city has preserved Old City Hall which is located immediately adjacent.
10,4.0,If you plan to see something in the area then have a look at the City Hall but don't go just to see it unless you have spare time
11,5.0,"It truly was a delight to have signed up for the free Tong-Tong Walking Tour of the Seoul City Hall. What a remarkable feat of architecture to have joined the old building with a new and very modern building. We were told that in order to complete the construction they had to dig a basement to adjoin the two buildings and for the entire duration of the construction, the old building was ""suspended"". The old building is now used as a public library. The new building houses the Largest Vertical Garden in the world (as recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). When we were there we were also able to enjoy a relic museum and a free janggu show at the basement. During winter, outside the City Hall is an ice skating rink too.Overall, it was a morning well spent."
12,3.0,"We just walked by the city hall on our way to Deoksugung palace. So many events going around the city hall, so the area was decorated beautifully. We don't enter the building, but decorations outside it are enough to make it a great photospot. It's beside the Seoul library too, so you can stop by in the library without any fees."
13,3.0,"I was there 2 weeks ago. Nothing is special expect the location which is good. In front of the building was paint exhibition/displays. I noticed that they have an anti homosexual movement just next to main entrance. Cheers,"
