0,5.0,Great example of incorporating nature in the city buildings. Great place to chill out and relax. Many local soak their feet in the crystal clear river water to cool themselves. Crane was spotted in the river fishing for food. River is not deep probably just ankle or knee deep water level. Very calming place to get away from the city buzz and just pass your evening away.
1,5.0,"This is one amazing work by the govt which converted and change this stream to clear water stream and odorless...with walkways and stage at certain part for performance.To see this in an ultra modern city which can provide calmness, relaxation for its citizen is really great...People were walking, jogging, cycling, pet walk without a worries as I saw there is security patrolling the area"
2,4.0,Lost stream / river that sadly extinct but got revived by the technology. Beautiful at night with the light display
3,4.0,"This is a good example of a worthy attempt to turn what was a stream that was extremely polluted and choked with sewerage and rubbish; cleaned out, exposed to air and light, restored and redesigned to turn it into city asset.  It still smells a bit but it's worth seeing."
4,5.0,I enjoy this peaceful river on my walk from Koreana Hotel to the office.  In the morning it is quiet and peaceful.  Sometimes in the day there are peaceful events for gathering.  Traffic is not so busy as the main streets.  I start at the spiral as the river begins and grows.
5,5.0,It is near the city hall station and is very nice place to visit. There is not only the stream but also a nice fall.
6,5.0,"The sight of Cheonggycheon Strem changes very frequently throughout the year, as all kinds of events are organized along it. My favourites were the lantern launching (sometime in November) and the Christmas decorations exhibited along the stream during winter time. It is worth walking along it and realizing how much this place has changed since the time it was just .....a stinky flow of water."
7,4.0,This stream area is nice to walk and lively.  At times they had tents set up with items for sale.  Definitely worth checking out.
8,4.0,"It is nice and romantic place to visit at night during X mas time. The weather is cold and a nice decoration of lighting. If you are a traveller, dont miss this place."
9,4.0,"Lovely to walk along this stream if you are near Insa-dong. During the day, the path is nice but at night, it's lit. Really pretty for the holidays!"
10,5.0,"A really pleasant escape from hustle and bustle of Seoul. A great walk in a green space with various places to sit, watch live music, play in the stream and generally soak up atmosphere and eat h people of Seoul relax and play"
11,4.0,Just an absolute bliss to walk alongside the stream right in the middle of busy Seoul.Also a venue for Live Up to Your Name Dr. Heo drama series.
12,4.0,"This place has been modernized some ten years ago and now it is favorite place for locals to have a walk in ther center of this huge city; especially at night when lights in various colours make this place very romantic you will see many young couples as well. We also used it to walk from our hotel to restaurants or shopping streets in the evening, far from noisy traffic."
13,4.0,"Seoul being one of the most boring places in the world, this river seems very exciting. It goes through the city. You can walk alongside it or drown yourself if Seoul is boring you too much. Recommended if you cannot get drunk at the Charles H."
14,5.0,I learned about this place in one of my urban development policy classes in Singapore. And to be here enjoying the waters and how this place was transformed from a road with a flyover to an accessible and ecologically friendly space accessible to people made me appreciate this place even more.
15,5.0,"The stream is below ground level and in a city of 10-million people, is a great place to walk and feel like you're in the countryside.I saw lots of fish in the stream too - most of which were over 18 inches long.You can cross from side to side using the stepping-stones which is also fun."
16,5.0,"I recommend anyone who like to stroll to visit the stream. There's no need to start from the end, just start somewhere and walk whichever way you want, you'll always end up somewhere close to a subway station.Along the way there's an electronic market that caught my interest, so I got out of the stream path for a quick check. Unless you have a very specific electronic components (not electrical appliances) you're looking for, doesn't waste your time."
17,5.0,"This is a beautiful river with different activities through the different parts of the walk.  You will pass through different sections of Seoul and lots of benches to sit.  In summer, you can soak your feet in the river to cool down.  Lots of street activities in the summer time along the river."
18,4.0,"It is a good place to have a leisurely stroll or even for exercise. It is great to have a stream in the middle of the city. I enjoyed walking along this stream, almost half the total length."
19,5.0,"What a gem, by night or day a beautiful and serene stream lined walk under ancient bridges. Lots of restaurants nearby, wonderful for after meal stroll or with a cone of ice cream in hand:) Great for couples!"
20,5.0,"Take the steps down to the Cheonggyecheon to listen to the relaxing sounds of the stream, sit by its banks, or just people watch. Beautiful hardscape and plants line its banks. Quiet in the morning especially the further away from the City Hall area that you walk. A lot of people sitting on the banks during lunch hour. Some beautiful planters made from recycled 2 liter plastic bottles hanging from the walls alongside added wonderful color to the concrete. Like most of the city well tended and clean."
21,4.0,"Seldom in major cities does one find an oasis and respite from the concrete jungle. What seems to be possibly another concrete canal or drain, the authorities have done a good job to green the canal with well placed plants in about almost any form. Be like a child again to skip across the stream on flat stones and get lost in the little twists and turns. Been here before on a hot summer day and the sounds of rushing waters gives relief to the hard sounds of traffic and other concrete jungle sounds. Enjoy the change of pace in a straight path."
22,4.0,"Our hotel was right near this stream and I enjoyed drinking coffee and looking out at the trees covered in white blossom that lined it at street level. People often stopped and looked from the bridges at the fast-flowing, clear water containing many fish. We also saw an ibis sheltering in the grass at the water's edge. It was a very relaxing and peaceful walk along the edge of the stream below the hustle at street level."
23,4.0,I was surprised to see recreatiinal.area like this in middle of city. Very nice and relaxing place during day.
24,5.0,This old stream was buried under roads for decades. It was recently 'daylighted' and is heavily used by people commuting to work or couples coming out at night. A huge win for Seoul.
25,4.0,"It was amazing that they managed to went through this massive project and built a stream of about 10 km throughout downtown Seoul. Truly refreshing, makes you forget about the hustle and bustle of the city, and it made me envious and hope that my hometown had this kind of fresh surroundings. I went at evening and walked about 2-3 km from near Dongdaemun Plaza while my friends were shopping nearby. It was pretty relaxing, some showcases at night but never really crowded. People seemed very relax and calm around this area. The cleanliness was amazing. I walked alone and felt safe, though I was hoping to find more lights to capture the beautiful spots. Take a slow walk around this area and just enjoy watching the cities go about at night just above your head."
26,5.0,"Tranquil, beautiful. Gorgeous light architecture. Fun to go just to see the [demurely] romantic Seoul cool kids wandering hand-in-hand late at night."
27,5.0,A must do . Breaks the city with a peaceful relaxing stream and brings out smiles on peoples faces ~ excellent case model for other over crowded cities
28,4.0,This is a nice little ((?)  Not really--it's 10.8 k long) retreat in the middle of the city.  Really nice to stroll along during a nice day.  Clean & safe.
29,5.0,"There were lots of Christmas decorations all brightly lit up at night, and a great spot to stroll along."
30,4.0,"A little bubbling creek runs through the middle of Seoul, about 3 meters below street level. It's cool and quiet and a great place to relax.In November and early December, the lantern festival brings clever illuminated paper sculptures suspended over the creek. It's busy on weekends, lots of cheerful people, ranging from small children and families to twenty-somethings on dates and elderly people out for a walk."
31,5.0,"Nothing better to do? Go for a walk around the stream and check out the art, the locals hanging out and the many things to do on a weekend around the cheonggyecheon stream. Very cool area, and with coffee shops and some of the key touristic areas of Seoul along it."
32,5.0,"... but then this wouldn't be as special. Amazing below-grade walk along this re-found center-city stream. It's calm, quiet, lots of people walking. Each couple of block the theme changes. Don't miss the huge tiled mural of an old battle."
33,5.0,"A number of staff at the hotel recommended seeing this and until you go and see, it is hard to explain and understand why. It clearly was a fabulous idea to create this and it comes off really well. I went for a really pleasant evening stroll - probably really nice at other times too but it felt quite safe with darkness falling and temperature was a bit cooler. The lighting makes it more interesting too in the evenings and it is easy to understand why it is so popular. Seoul has a lot of history to look at but this is a reminder that they can very creative in a modern ecological way too."
34,4.0,"We stopped by the Cheonggyecheon Stream following a day of touristing all over Seoul. It was lovely to dip our toes in the water and cool off in the heat. The atmosphere was lovely, with lots of families and couples enjoying the water and buskers to listen to. We passed by again after dark and enjoyed the lights."
35,4.0,"Makes for a wonderful walk next to a gentle stream in the middle of the city. Some neat artwork on the walls. Take off your shoes, and dip your feet in the refreshing water. Great people watching too."
36,5.0,A very relaxing experience at nights or evening times. A lot of activities such as people playing music etc. A great atmosphere in general.
37,5.0,If you love walking you should try this. The walk is very relaxing and takes you away from the noisy and busy streets of Seoul. The stream is lower than the street level so you don't hear much noise from the cars. The water also makes it very peaceful. A lot of people stop and enjoy the river flow by putting their feet in the cold water. Beautiful place to relax after a crazy day.
38,3.0,I wouldnt have gone out of my way to walk along here. Very pretty and some nice photos but not much going on.perhaps Im just not enough in touch with the serenity required to enjoy an urban stream
39,4.0,"This is a good place to take picture, meeting point, relax, chit chat, enjoying the atmosphere.  We can walk along the stream and hear the sound of water.  At night the stream will have so many lights, make sure you take picture of you here."
40,5.0,"Despite the initial criticism of the construction cost and the fact that it has no historical value, this stream is a wonderful urban idea. At least it is better than building more malls. It reduces traffic and is a cool place to hang out. The environment is good and makes a great stop especially if you are into kpop since big bang filmed a mv here. They often have shows here too. It is a good form of exercise to walk along the stream. A welcomed sight in the concrete jungle."
41,5.0,It is quite nice and peaceful area. Surrounded by high-rises. There are couple of bars along the stream where you can relax and drink. They have a laser show sometime in the evening. Recommended for a romantic stroll.
42,5.0,"Runs through the city, very clean and attracts all ages to sit and eat by the water; flood lite at night; very pretty and a great meeting place."

45,5.0,It is amazing to see history of this place and how it transformed from past dirty place to a magnificent museum and art exhibition place.Very beautiful and well organized.
46,5.0,"This is a great little attraction.  I frequently walk along this stream.  It's pretty, peaceful in-spite of being busy and interesting with its regularly changing features.  I you have the time and the energy I would walk along through to the Han river.     In the early morning you tend to have older folks meandering along with the occasional stop for Tai Chi.  In the evening the young lovers are out in force.  A wonderful place to relax and unwind.  I live in Seoul."
47,4.0,We walked along the stream after dinner in the evening. It was very pretty all lit up! I would recommend going at night.
48,4.0,Go here just to take a walk and explore many coffee shops lining up the road on both the sides with a very European feel. Note : Make sure you know how to get a taxi back to your hotel. We had to wait for a long time before we got a cab.
49,5.0,"Nice walk at the Cheonggyecheon steam in the evenings, full of life and near a busy nightlife area. from restaurants, to rooms and bars."
50,5.0,"What an effort...kudos to the Korean ingenuity for making a old river site into a clean, breathable, teeming with life....I am so envious of their nice rivers...."
51,5.0,"My husband and I spent about an hour walking along this stream one night. It wasn't very crowded, possibly because it was a little drizzly off and on. The setting is absolutely beautiful.  There are a couple of murals on the wall and a laser show every 20 minutes over a little bridge in one area. It's really peaceful and romantic."
52,5.0,Depends on your objective. You can just follow the stream and can lead you from Myeongdong to Dongdaemum. Very pleasant to walk and enjoy acoustic of the flowing water. Many staircase available for you to get up to road level and enjoy good food before continue your exercises. You may also choose to sit below the bridge to relax a bit and chatting with your friends. Remember to wear your comfortable walking shoe when you plan to do this.
53,4.0,"Found this restored stream by accident when exploring near our hotel and enjoyed viewing the art work. Morning visit and not too busy, hoping to return one evening to see it lit up."
54,5.0,The stream runs in the heart of Seoul in a beautiful promenade with many quiet places to sit and relax.Many stream crossing enables changing sides and watching it from just over the water.Don't miss the waterfall!Every about 100meter there's a way in/out of the promenade - back to the city center.
55,5.0,This is my second trip here and what i like about this place is its offer a very good walk and you can see all walks of life here. the stream is so clean and sound very soothing.
56,5.0,"I strolled through the Cheonggyecheon Stream restoration park many times during my recent two week stay in Seoul, watching Spring unfold day by day. It's a pleasant way to traverse the city.  It is used by locals and tourists alike.  I was in the city for the 1st anniversary of the ferry tragedy and the Cheonggyecheon was the site of protest as well - which resulted in lots of police in the area,  If you are interested in history and redevelopment if the city then check out the museum near the eastern end of the stream walk.  It tells the story of the restoration of the stream corridor by demolishing a large elevated highway that once covered the area that is now the park.  Really a remarkable and inspiring story of urban development.  You can take the metro to the eastern part of the city - and see a bit more gritty version of the city with more authentic marketplaces."
57,5.0,"The stream is a world-leading example of ecological restoration, having been created in the site of what was once a major highway through the city. At all hours of the day, this is a peaceful break from the city, and I enjoyed jogging alongside the stream on a Sunday morning looking at the landscaping, plants and fish. The stream is 11km long, but even walking a short stretch of it is a great alternative to the subway or busy streets."
58,5.0,Enjoyable walk with street performances along the stream. Very safe and worth checking out with your partner.
59,4.0,"This stream has a very interesting history. It was buried for many years and then excavated into it's current state. It's built in a very interesting way to keep the water clear, the rocks being an integral part. In the summer when it is so terribly hot in Seoul it is refreshing to go for a stroll along it. Shame they don't build a few outdoor cafés a la France along it."
60,4.0,"Nice place to visit when in Seoul. There's nothing to do there but to stroll. A good place to go to when you need to ponder and be serene in the middle of a bustling city.We had a tour guide when we went there, and it's great to know how the South Korean government gives much attention to their urban planning."
61,5.0,The stream walk is a great area to walk and enjoy local food and culture. The stream was a huge gamble made by a previous Seoul mayor who spent something like a billion dollars US to build this common area. I believe the investment is paying off though as it has become a meeting place for many thousands of people since its completion and business in the area seems to be doing well. The stream leads one into the central city just south of the palace. There are more shopping areas and departments stores than one can count and the restaurants and equally prolific and varied. The area is also a great area to pick up cultural and unique souvenirs. Christmas time here is particularly nice as the city installs large floats along much of the streams length. This is an area you should see while visiting Seoul.
62,3.0,"Nice for a stroll, but absolutely nothing special during the day in winter.  Just go to the start of stream where the waterfall is (Gwanghwamun Line 5 or Jonggak Line 1).  Probably better at night or when an event is being held.  Otherwise every other stream or river in Seoul has an equal or better park with walking or bike tracks along it."
63,5.0,I came for 48 hours to Seoul and was lucky to see this lantern festival.  Very nice paper made lanterns with a lot of colors. Beutifull! !!
64,4.0,"This little bit of calm in the middle of one of the most exciting cities in the world is totally fake, which fits with the Seoul ethos of creating experiences.  But don't let that put you off, it is truly a fantastic walk with a lot of interpretive art, and hidden art spaces along its length.  As a business traveller I found it the perfect decompression space between meetings, but also for an evening stroll without dealing with multiple road crossings that are endemic in Seoul.  Not necessarily a must do, but a must see of what a determined administration can do - tear down a motorway and not replace any road capacity and nobody is saying it was the wrong thing to do!"
65,5.0,"The 10.9-km Cheonggyecheon Stream starts from Gwanghwamun Square, the heart of downtown Seoul and runs through the neighborhoods of Jongno and Dongdaemun. The restoration of the historic Cheonggyecheon Stream was completed in 2005 and was newly born as it is now. Ever since, it has been a modern public recreation space by Seoulites. Walk along cheonggaecheon stream for a break in the center of downtown Seoul and you will be refreshed. If you have more time, go to the cheonggaecheon museum where you will learn the history of cheonggaecheon."
66,5.0,"This a very nice place to walk in the evening , the invest a lot of money to convert a very poor river"" to a very nice place to visit."
67,4.0,"They call it Seoul streams, it has a history, it was transformed to one of the most romantic spot in the Big busy city of Seoul. Chilly in the fall!!"
68,3.0,Interesting and certainly worth the detour especially in the evening when the combined effect of the lights and the water stream makes the difference
69,3.0,"Nothing special about the water stream. Maybe it is nicer at night. But it is ok for sitting around, wathcing people in the square area, buying ice cream and enjoy this site."
70,4.0,enjoyed the walk by the stream. clean waters with some fish to join you in your walk.. good spot for dating and reflection.. ^^
71,5.0,"This is a really well done project and is worth checking out. If you're older and remember Seoul from 10-20-40 years ago and the awful post-war concreteness of it all you'll probably get a real kick out of this. It's creative, innovative and shows how far this country has come and where it's going. All this from a stroll along the river. Go figure."
72,4.0,Have been here both night and day. Difference is like night and day. I would recommend for night scenic view rather than during day.
73,3.0,"A stream in the centre of the city is a nice touch but I'm not sure it is a major tourist attraction? Having said that, I visited during the lantern festival and it was heaving at night!"
74,5.0,"Wow, take a walk on this mile long river walk in the middle of the old city and you'll escape all the noise and pollution above. It's truly a wonderful design and so full of trees and flowering plants. Lots of couples and families in this modern park setting. A marvel."
