0,3.0,I found this museum to be very confusing physically. It is a big place but difficult to figure out which way to go and how the rooms connected chronologically. Also it was overrun with students the day I visited which made it super crowded.  However it is free--and the various exhibits are very informative on the history of Korea and Seoul. Everything is in English also!!  The highlight is the huge model of the City of Seoul--that is a must see.  Gives you a great idea of how big Seoul is and how it is laid out.  Before I visited here I would recommend the Palace Museum at Gyeonbokgung Palace and the Cheonggyecheon Museum. They were both better arranged and had just as much information.   But if time permits--this is worthwhile.
1,4.0,"It's right next to the train station (when you exit and before you reach the palace's gates) but it usually gets overlooked. There's not a lot of things inside but good for a 25 mins walk. Plus, they had stamps that you can stamp on paper for free as souvenir."
2,4.0,"While the museum is relatively small, there are a lot of interesting artifacts, dioramas, and good signage (in English, too) that show how Seoul evolved from a kingdom to a pop cultural and technological juggernaut (mostly in the past two decades). There's a free, fun photo booth that puts you in historic settings, as well as proximity to one of the city's lesser known and ornate, but hugely interesting palaces nearby. It's a good first stop as well as a fun place to take the kids or take shelter from rain or snow...and you can't beat the admission price!"
3,3.0,"nice to take picture and learn seoul history, cold whether, peaceful and  a giant interactive city model is one of many highlights. Definitely worth stopping by for an hour or two."
4,4.0,Enjoyed the way the culture and history was captured specifically for Seoul from the onset. The address posted is to Seoul Station which is south of the Museum.
