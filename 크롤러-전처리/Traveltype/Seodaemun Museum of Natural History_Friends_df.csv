0,5.0,"I have seen many Natural History Museums and this is for sure not the largest but the rock and minerals collection displayed here is absolutely outstanding. Seoul has a lot to offer tourist, so depends on the time available to you and your interests; you may consider visiting Seodaemun Museum. There is no subway station near the museum and you will have to walk up/down hill for about 10 min to reach the Bus Stop. You can also take a taxi which is usually at a reasonable cost in Seoul."
1,3.0,"This museum is tucked away and hidden from regular traffic, but don't expect that to mean it'll be empty. The adult fee is a reasonable 3,000 won. There are lockers on the main floor for you to store bags or coats. The museum is not large enough to get lost in, so you don't need to pick up the offered brochures unless you want a keepsake of your trip. All the displays are in Korean, so if you are a foreigner who doesn't speak the language, this is really just a look-through trip as opposed to anything educational. (I'm perfectly fine with those myself.) Worth the trip if you have a free day and no idea what to do."
