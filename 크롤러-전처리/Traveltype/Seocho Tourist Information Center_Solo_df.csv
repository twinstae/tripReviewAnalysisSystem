1,5.0,"I got off the subway station at Gangnam square and saw this two story information center. I walked in to inquire about the area and two staff members helped orientate me to the area and I walked away with plenty of things to do. Not to mention, if you go upstairs you get to try traditional Korean musical instruments and dress. A great, quick recommended stop when in this neighborhood."
2,5.0,I happen to find this place while walking around and was delightfully surprised by my experience. Uno was very helpful with providing information about the area...  but best of all she provided an amazing cultural experience allowing me to try traditional instruments and clothes for free. Really cool to try on a Hanbok! Definitely come here!
