0,4.0,"I like the architecture and how central and well connected it is. The station is clean and relatively easy for travellers to find their way. Buses, taxi stands, metro, trains in a clean station. Good station"
1,4.0,Seoul train station is really clean and not that huge so anyone can find the train very easily but the elevator is not working sometimes that makes you difficult to carry your bag pack anyway there is easy access to get in and out.
2,4.0,Do you know this was the first Subway Station built in Seoul South Korea?? Just a fun fact anyways I like this station its bustling it's busy if you're in for shopping there is lotte duty stores nearby it's convenient you can also walk to City Hall and 남대문 market and gate is ideal it's pretty.
3,4.0,We got a free ticket to walk through two floors of this station. A group of seemingly students had created a form of art in every room. We got the feeling the Korean's really want to give freedom to creativity in youngsters.
