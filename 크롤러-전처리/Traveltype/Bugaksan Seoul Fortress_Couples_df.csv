0,4.0,We had a good trek up the fortress walls and were rewarded with a great view of the surrounding town and good exercise.Recommended to come here in the morning to avoid potential crowds and also to work up an appetite for lunch later
1,3.0,"If you have a little more time on your hands, you can also start from Hyehwa subway station. The walk from the subway station to Sungkyunkwan University is through a nice shopping/cafe area, where you can grab some coffee, lunch or fruit juice. The university has a small entrance in the wall from the street that runs along its west side (Sungkyunkwan-ro 5-gil), head for the old buildings and check out the lecture hall and the ages old gingko tree. Then take the back gate to Waryong park (look up this location on your smartphone). From there, everything is well signed: follow the signs to Malbawi to get to the start of the military area. From there, you can only go one way: the westward one, which is, as others pointed out, the right way to do this hike, as it ends with the endless staircase downwards.On the other hand, the Hyehwa quarter is also a great place to end your day in one of its many bars and restaurants!"

At different times, you can see the city from different angles, but more importantly, you're in the fresh air of the mountains that surround the city.You have to show your passport or similar type of ID in order to walk the trail, but it's free and very healthy.  In the past, No. Korea soldiers have attacked the fortress and there's evidence along the trail.  You have to be quite healthy before attempting certain parts of the trail and you should bring at least a litre of water with you, especially if it's hot and humid."
3,5.0,"The views are fantastic and there are rest stops along the way where you can take a break. Bring water and a snack. We walked the main section of the wall and talked with some Korean locals at various points, and two Australians each doing the hike solo. The entire outing took the better part of a day since we also walked there and back from Insadong where we were staying. We explored interesting neighborhoods on the way, and stopped for a beer at an art bar/cafe on the way back. I'd do this again the next time I am in Seoul. IMHO it's better to walk the route east to west, as there are many stairs and a fast upward rise on the west side."
4,4.0,"Try this trip if you want to get closer to the nature. There is a trail through the Waryong Park and then walking by the fortress wall. You will get a really nice view over Seoul and mountains surrounding the city. It is a military area so remember to take your passport (you will need to register and show your passport to get a pass). Take some comfortable shoes. We took subway to Anguk Station, exit 2, and then bus no. 2 that departs like 10 meters from this exit. Bus ride takes about 10 minutes, we got off on the last stop and walked from there."
