1,5.0,"The gate is walkable from many stations. If you have the energy, you can walk from this gate to many other spots like the Namdaemun Market, Namsan park, Seoul Station, Seoul Tower, etc.The gate was simple and we took a quick photo before heading to the other stops"
2,4.0,"Fortunately our hotel was just 5 minutes walk from this very impressive gate, so we actually visited the place three twice during our stay in Seoul. The gate can be reached from it's south side from near Namdaemun market and down a small road beside a mini-mart. The original gate was destroyed in a fire and this is the rebuilt one which is still very impressive. It is the Southern gate to the city of Seoul.During my second visit, by luck actually, I was able to watch the changing of the guards which made the place a lot more special and allowed me to take fairly close up photos of the guards themselves. The guards do not mind photo taking although they will not allow you to get up in their faces the way the guards do outside Buckingham Palace.At the entrance to the gate there is a small booth with an elderly gentleman and brochures freely available in several different languages. There are also public toilets here."
3,4.0,"This is the southern gate of Seoul in Joseon Dynasty.Visitors can only watch. But, the symbolic value is higher than any other landmarks.- Also known as Namdaemun literally meaning southern big gate. Locals are more familiar with this name.- The access is from the other side from Namdaemun Market. Easy to circle around finding it.- As many people know, it had been on fire years ago. The one remaining now is a modern work built after studying proofs.- Better to stay away when there's an event or a gathering. It will have a huge traffic around this area."
4,5.0,We were shopping at namdaemun market and chances upon this attraction at the end of the market.  Understand that most if not all of this gate had been burnt down and this is a reconstructed one. Basically this is the outer gate to the city with part of the city walls. Ceremonial guards are still been stationed here and they are happy for you to pose beside them for photos. Spend about half an hour here taking photos.
5,5.0,Found this while walking around Seoul - Namdaemun market.A free attraction.This gate was built in the late 1390's and served as the new capital's emperor's gate of exalted ceremonies.The beautiful preservation and grounds keeping was amazing in the middle of a major metropolis.Witnessed the changing of the guards and got to take photos with them!
6,4.0,"Nice place to visit, everyone would stand to look at the shifting of the guards in a traditional ceremony, you can take pictures with them after the ceremony it was a wonderful to watch how they were dressed and played the drums."
7,5.0,We went there on our first day in Seoul. A great historical site to see...you can see the guards & take photo with them. Very near to the famous Namdaemun Market. You can walk across the street or take the underground pathway...take extra caution if using the underground since it is quiet & a bit creepy. Not advisable if you are alone...

9,4.0,"The south gate (Namdaemun) is probably the most impressive of all the Seoul Fortress gates. I had visited two years ago, and viewed the gate at night. It is much more impressive in the daytime. It was originally built in 1398. The gate was extensively damaged during the Korean War, and was repaired in 1961. The gate was damaged by arson in 2008, and reopened in 2013.It may be easily accessed by subway line 4, Hoehyeon Station, exit # 5 or a 10 minute walk from Seoul Station, exit # 4. If using the Hoehyeon Station, the walk will take you through Namdaemun market which has great shopping. This route will take you to the rear of the gate, and it will be necessary to cross the road and walk around to the entrance of the gate. There is a changing of the guard ceremony sometimes that we were lucky enough to see and take photos with the guards.This was our last stop on our day trip of visiting all the remaining gates of Seoul Fortress, and was probably the best way to end. Admission is free, and the gate is accessible from the front. There is a beautiful mural under the arch."

11,3.0,"Namdaemun gate is really not that hard to find. Towering in the middle of the road, it is really an eye catcher and a nice piece in a mix of old and new Seoul. I must admit that there is nothing that special with it since a lot of the same structures can be found in the palaces and temples, historically speaking and as a first timer in Korea, I appreciate it and how it is really maintained."
12,4.0,Not an extensive attraction but worth walking around to see the extraordinary gates and beautiful stone work in the walls. The gate is also beautifully lit at night - worth the night time photographs.
13,3.0,It's cool to see from a historical standpoint but is only worth about 10 minutes to look at. You can't even walk through the gate.
14,5.0,It is very beautiful especially at night. Worth taking pictures with. It has shown us about what is Korea Ancient structures look like even though most are newly constructed.
