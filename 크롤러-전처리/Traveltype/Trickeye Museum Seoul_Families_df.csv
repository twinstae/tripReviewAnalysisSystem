Better video because it will provide u with amazing special effects like in fantasy movies. Every corner of the museum has its own thematic venue. Kids shall be definitely happy. There is also an ice museum with ice sculptures but it‚Äôs too tight. Better come early in the morning as it will be crowded and u need a time and space to make quality videos. Better leave clothes and unnecessary stuff in locker box. 100% recommended even if u don‚Äôt like boring museums. It is more than museum, it is an adventure."
1,5.0,"The ice museum on the side is not really worth a visit, especially if you have seen ice sculptures elsewhere. Little kids would love it though.The Trick Eye concept is very clever - though sharing your photos with them might be risky. It is only 12000w entry, and a nice diversion from the shopping. Worthwhile even without teenagers. Future museums will all have this special effects capability. Clever"
2,4.0,"Had some trouble finding this attraction  because it is located in a building without a clear and obvious sign. After figuring out which building it was then also had the difficult of finding the entrance which is at the basement of the building, which it shares with another attraction. Spent about 1.5 hrs here taking various photos. The background was intriguing and allowed one to take various interesting photos."
3,5.0,I had such a fun with my three young kids.There are so many photo spots and it's a perfect place to visit with young kids.I will definitely visit again!!
4,3.0,Only some art pieces are 3d. the rest are normal. this is the 2nd time i come here. Feel so old the place has become.
5,5.0,A very good place to enjoy taking nice funny pictures. It‚Äôs good for ppl of all ages who just want to have fun.
6,5.0,We had such a fun experience here! Kids enjoyed it just as much as the adults. Make sure to download the free interactive app while you‚Äôre there. It will make your pictures come to life! Fabulous and well-worth the visit!
7,3.0,My family of eight visited the Trick Eye Museum June 2019. It was very underwhelming. First you download their app onto your phone and then take videos of friends moving in front of a picture. The app allows animated action to take place and when you play it back it is fun. The museum is in the basement of the building which also includes a giant freezer with a slide and ice sculptures. If you are looking for something that takes about an hour you might enjoy this. Personally I would skip this - not because it is bad but because it isn't great.
8,5.0,"I had such a fun time here with my wife and sister-in-law. So many cool and interesting backdrops to take photos with. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through everything. There was also free entrance into an ice museum within the same building, which was small but still pretty cool! Definitely worth it if you enjoy these kinds of things!"
9,5.0,"Very interesting using a 3D Augmented Reality App ,  you can film a short video as you become part of the action. It is worth a visit if you have a couple hours to kill especially on a rainy day. Also, included was the Ice musuem  with some interesting ice sculptures in a giant freezer."
10,5.0,We visited the Trickeye Museum in Seoul and spent a few hours there. It has a downloadable app which activates special effects in most of their displays like a fire-breathing dragon. The app acts as a camera which you use to take photos with the special effects. The Ice Museum was basically a cold storage with ice sculptures which was even too cold for a Canadian! All in all it was great fun for CAD 20.
11,5.0,a wonderful few hours at this museum. full of illusions. they have free wifi and an app that helps you fully enjoy it so don't forget to download it for great pictures
12,4.0,"TrickEye museum was good! With the TrickEye app, it was fun clicking pictures and recording videos. Ice museum is a total waste of money/time."
13,3.0,"There were a few pictures which were neat, but several were confusing.  It was crowded and made taking pics difficult.  Would not recommend."
14,4.0,"Really fun and you can spend more than two hours to take the photos.  Please remember to download the app before you take any photos and also put your backpack to the locker, just 500 won.  Just take your wallet and camera is good enough."
15,5.0,"Great place! A lot of fun, its incredible that this is the first on america! Bring your hole family and a full loaded battery so you can enjoy it properly."
16,5.0,A really fun place.  We took our kids and they loved it!  Great technology makes it even better!  Would definitely go back again!
17,4.0,"The technology is better and better now.  The Trickeye Museum provides fantastic 4D app that allow taking wow pictures and videos beyond your imagination.  We did have pleasant surprises from using this fantastic app.  By using this app, dinosaurs are moving, angels are flying, pictures are blinking and more surprises going on ..."
18,5.0,Have visited this museum with my family and it was fun and enjoying. My kids like it very much and they were having lots of fun.üòçü§ó
19,5.0,it was a fun and interesting place to visit with family. My kids enjoyed very much. i strongly recommend this place.
20,5.0,Spend over 2 hour taking photos and checking the 3D animations. The mirror maze could be a challange as well
21,3.0,We had fun re-creating photographs. You can blend and interact with the paintings. The Ice museum is an extra treat.
22,5.0,"Make sure you bring camera, as there are plenty of photo ops in here for sure! Spare at least 2 hours To fully enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience. It‚Äôs 3D art and optical illusions at its finest! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. As an added bonus, the same ticket also gives you free access to Ice Museum and Carnival Street (all in the same building). It is definitely worth the price of admission!!! By subway: get off at Hongik University Station (Line #2), exit 9. It‚Äôs about a 5-10 min. walk from there."
23,3.0,Long walk from Hongik Station.  They have apps for a much more realistic picture.  You must have a companion to take your picture or bring a tripod to take your shot
24,5.0,There are lots of 3D wall paintings for selfie and group photos. The mirror maze was quite tricky and some paintings would become animated with phone application. Highly recommended
25,5.0,"It is very hard to write how much fun this place is, you enter a world where you are part of many 3D experinces its so real so when you are with dinosaurs blowing flames it is so real.We spent a couple of hours there and enjoyed every minute.Entry was about ¬£12 best value ever"
26,4.0,"We had the Discover Seoul Pass (DSP) & made a trip here after one of our day tours (most tours stop at Hongik Univ stn). Easy to find & redeem as it's one of the attractions under the DSP, together with the Ice Museum.The counter staff was not friendly as we had questions how to download the app. Service was curt & no smiles from the staff there. They appeared impatient, maybe because it was near closing time.U need the app to enjoy the museum. It's kind of small & u can get through within 1 hr.It's definitely something different from the usual 3D places, and we were happy to have experienced the fun!"
27,5.0,4 days agoloved it! Will be going back. Can spend all day enjoying the museum.My son loved it so much he kept asking to go there againüòçüòç
28,5.0,"Plenty of fun, nice and helpful personnel, creative design and good value for the price. Thank you very much"
29,5.0,"I heard a lot about this place from other people and was so excited to visit this place. Recently visited this place and jaw dropped. The three hours I spend there wee full of fun, Laughs and lot of picture taking.Their Trickeye app on your phone is the Jem and adds a lot to the fun.To all the people and foreigners out there do visit this place at least fun. one of a life time experience"
30,5.0,"The place is amazing. I would suggest you to go there for sure. You can go with you family, friends and with anybody you want. It is a complete fun place. You can do lot of activities and use different tricks with 3D effect to take pictures. The museum his own camera app, which is great. You can use the app by which pictures come out with more 3D effect. It was a complete fun!"
31,3.0,This is an interesting place with 3 attractions in one place. However please note the Love museum is for adults only not for children.
32,4.0,This is kind of one of the fun place...You can take a lot of great pictures with the back drops if you can pose and capture the right angles....
33,5.0,"Go there and get some funny photos while in Seoul. Also, like the Ice Museum next door, one ticket, you can visit 2 museum. where kids and adults all enjoy, all made out of ice."
34,5.0,"Something absolutely out of the ordinary, you download their app and you enter this magical world of illusions and eye tricks. Our 9 yrs old daughter loved it and so did we!"
35,4.0,"Place to bring teens and pre-teens who are bored of the history museums, temples, and palaces of Seoul.  Fun place for adults also.  It was 90 degrees farenheit outside but below freezing in the Ice section of their museum so definitely wear the poncho."
36,4.0,Great place to take the kids. Make sure u download the app and charge your phone. It‚Äôs kinda hard to find because it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere. Once inside it‚Äôs just amazing. The art and illusions are fun to experience and they even had a ice museum which was perfect for the summer heat.
37,4.0,This place is amazing.  The tricks your eyes play through the camera are amazing.  lots of fun.  There are 3 museums in 1 although one is adult only.  The ice portion is a great way to cool down on a hot day.
38,4.0,"Very nice place and amazing.. good for all ages .. everyone visit this museum will enjoy and fun .. .Ticket price for adult 15000 KRW and for child over 3 years 12000 KRW, Child below 3 years free"
39,4.0,"We got our ticket for trick eye and ice museum at klook. We enjoyed the different sceneries and taking lot of pictures with our camera and their APP. My android phone isnt supported for video, only pictures. At one time, my phone got too hot, so I had to let it rest while we just used our camera. But the effects were nice as well.For the ice museum, we brought our winter gear - jacket, hoods, gloves. So we were able to stay there a bit longer than others around 30mins only.It was sad that the korean costume shop in the facility has already closed. But still, we had fun."
40,1.0,Rubbish in every aspect and well over-priced! The museum is situated in an area of Seoul that is smelky and dirty. Don't bother!
41,5.0,"It's our first time to be in a 3D museum. I thought it was just for taking pictures. But in Trickeye, they have an app that makes the exhibits ""come alive"". Some of the signage where you should take your pictures to have that 3D effect needs to be replaced because some of it are already blurred."
42,3.0,A silly place to take your kids to break up the cultural stuff in Seoul. Lots of funny scenes to be photographed in. Great position for shopping and food once you have done it. A little pricy in my opinion.
43,5.0,"Amazing option to escape from all the saturated ""historical & cultural trips"". The children loved it.Funny pictures, memorable time and a repeatable experience. Definitely I will come back with my family and retake the same pictures in a few years to compare and relive our family history."
44,5.0,Fun and quick visit to this museum located in a lively neighborhood. Great to do with friends and good for all ages. Make sure you have a full phone battery and download the app in advance to save time and take full advantage of the AR offerings.
45,3.0,"It was fun and an escape from the cold outside during my visit. But, it was smaller than I thought. I was surprised when I have already reached the exit."
46,5.0,I didn't expect this museum to be this good!! Really loved all the effects and the originality of each one of the attractions!! The augmented reality app is just incredible!
47,5.0,"It is a completely different experience from any other place in Seoul, the place is just amazing, Nice Effects on the Museum app and constantly improving!, It's my second time going there and I was surprised by a lot of new effects in the Augmented reality app! I was able to spent a great time with my family!"
48,4.0,This place is a fun place for family and friends. You can spend a couple of hours taking 3d pictures. You can also download their application to enjoy the effects better. Worth the visit. This is for the young and young at heart.
49,5.0,"Itis very amazing to visit Trickeye Museum:you can try to come here and you can also do some of these things:1. you can take a photo (with trickeye application) and get the amazing result in your photo. beautiful photo with powerful motion of anime.2. you also ca get experience and know about some history from this museum.3. you can bring your child and play with him around this museum.Thank you for amazing experience, Trickeye Museum^^"
50,4.0,"I went to this museum with my family and all of us thought that was a very fun place to go. However, it was a bit crowded when we got there so I guess it'd be better if you could go as early as possible to avoid the crowd."
51,4.0,This place is worth visiting with the family. We had fun taking the 3d pictures. You could also download the app to enjoy it better. Fun place for the young and the young at heart!
52,3.0,"Kids love this kind of stuff. Situated in a bustling University neighborhood, this place is full of young people, college students and tourists. They recommend you download the Trickeye App which makes the photos you take become 3d videos.  I'd rather be sightseeing but it was nice quirky diversion for the kids. It doesn't take long to go through it, less than an hour."
53,4.0,"It was kind of difficult to find, but once we did it was amazing! Interactive pieces of art. Truly brings out the kid in you. Also the ice house is super fun be sure you bring a coat! Would definitely go again"
54,5.0,This place is awesome and is great for days when the weather is not. It is best to go with at least one other person so you may take pictures of each other interacting with the art.
55,5.0,"The Museum did not look much at the outside, but we had so much fun inside! Climbing up down the pictures or statues, swinging and walking and taking all sorts of funny pictures. Bring out the children and actor/actress in us! We look at the pictures again. They  are certainly the one of the highlight of our trip to Seoul. You really have to try it!"
56,5.0,"Fun for 8-10 year olds. Big room for virtual reality. You could spend lots of time there, depending on how many pictures you want to take. Exciting for a group of children, not just one. Requires you to download an app, to take pictures with special effects. Wouldn't be the same without the app. Staff is friendly, helpful, and speaks english."
57,5.0,We visited the trickeye museum and it was a great experience for a family with kids.  There is a free app to work with the museum but it will drain your battery. I highly recommend!
58,4.0,"Kids and adults will love this place.  Enjoyed all the AR experience except for the zombie street.  At certain stops, you need to be patient for the AR effect to appearDon't forgo the ice museum.  Has an ice sled inside which the little ones will enjoy. Word of caution... it is extremely cold inside.Do stop by the Tourist Information center for discount coupon worth 35%.  Keep the admission tickets. It has AR features too on it too."
59,5.0,Amazed by the creativity. Kids had a lot of fun posing for photos. You can download an app to add some augmented reality (AR) using the free wifi available.
60,2.0,"Not a Museum for me. It can be fun, but this is not a museum, this is a place where you go to make pictures with your kids or friends. I dind't like but maybe was because i went for myself and it doesn't have nothing to see."
61,5.0,"This place was so much fun, my brothers and I enjoyed going through and taking unique pictures. Def make a stop here"
62,4.0,This place of illusion is the ideal place to play out some fantasies. Want to strut Hollywood's red carpet? You can do it here. Want to ride a dragon? Absolutely.The app which you can download and use to enhance the pictures even more is welcome bonus.
63,5.0,My mom and I really enjoyed this place because we love to be silly and take photos. It's fun to really see the effects after and it was something new to us. Go only if you like taking pictures and are easily pleased :-) This came with a free entrance to the ice museum too but we only stayed a short while there because it was too cold!!
64,5.0,It was amazing! My daughter makes IMovies so she made one about this trip because she had plenty of pictures and videos. We stayed in a hotel for three days near it and went two of the days. Just saying  if you stay near it don't go every day. It was really cool though and now everybody in my family is begging to go back. If you haven't been there I tried not to spoil it to much.
65,4.0,Wow wat an experience  it was my first time at a 3d  museum  and u throughly enjoyed it just wanted to keep taking pictures it was so awesome.. please note you are to remove shoes here so be prepared for that . ...
66,5.0,We had such a  wonderful time here.  Only wish we could have stayed longer.   So much fun and easy to navigate
67,4.0,Price are not expensiv. It's a bit difficult to find. The woman at the ticket box speak english and explain you everything with a smile.The museum is actually 2 different museum the trickeye museum and the ice museum. You can't choose. It's better to have a smartphone with you to enjoy the special effects after downloading a free app. The ice museum was really cold and the girl at the entrance of the ice museum is even colder as she stare at you without saying or explaining anything.
68,5.0,"I took my father to the Trickeye Museum on our last day in Seoul because it was raining and the Government museums and closed on Monday. What a surprise, We Loved this Museum! My father said if he knew about this museum earlier he would have spent more time there. You can put yourself into the artwork and take a picture with your camera, now your part of the artwork. For the elderly of disabled, the downside of the museum is going down 2 full flights of stairs. No elevator."
69,5.0,"The Trickeye Museum is an interesting place to visit and it's free. There are several areas where there are distorted drawings on the floor, but when you take a photo of the drawings at a certain angle they turn out looking normal! They have a virtual ride, where you put on what looks like an oculus rift VR headset, where you can choose what type of ride to go on. I don't recall how much we paid, but our kids enjoyed it and that's all that really mattered. On the opposite side of the virtual ride there's a camera that takes a photo of your face which then crops your face into a Kpop music video on the TV next to it. We had a good laugh. We looked really funny doing the Crayon Pop and Gang Nam Style dance!  At the end of it all, we headed for the restroom because we didn't know when we'd get another chance to go. We were surprised at the images of people staring back at you while you are sitting on the toilet. It was surprisingly entertaining. This is a really cute and fun little place to visit once."
70,5.0,"Directions by subway: Take Line no. 2 green line and exit Hongik Station and walk out of exit 9. Keep walking straight for about 3- 5 mins depending on your speed, you will cross the first traffic light and you will see SPAO a big clothing store with red sign. Soon you will see Tonymoly, a beauty cosmetic store on the right corner, turn right and keep walking. You will see the vertical museum sign on the building on the right hand side in about 3 minutes. There was a horse carriage in the front of the entrance but I don't know if it belonged to the museum. Tips: 1. Must download the Trickyeye museum app before you go for maximum effect. You will not regret it. 2. Use the restroom so you don't have to come out plus there are some funny paintings inside. 3. There are small photos of suggestions of how to pose next to the props, take advantage of them. 4. Be patient as it may take more than a few tries to get the pose right. 5. I printed a coupon off the official Korea Tourism website for 12,000 wons per ticket. 6. There were probably 20 props so if you want to take a photo with all of them, it may take more than a couple hours."
71,5.0,"I had always wanted to go, so when my friends (and their kids) were in Korea, we thought we's check it out. Its not cheap (if you have a lot of kids) but when you download the app and experience the augmented reality-- wow! Be sure your phone battery is fully charged-- and preferably, bring an extra. Very cool, and something all ages can enjoy. If you can go mid-week or off-peak times, it's better with less people as you are taking turns, and people can walk in front of your camera."
72,4.0,This was a long cab drive from our hotel but worth the drive.  Plan to spend a good amount of time exploring the museum and taking pictures.  The museum was clean and well attended.
73,4.0,"A very clever display of 3d artwork and AR video imagery overlaid to make some impressive video and photos. My teenage children really enjoyed this place, especially the ice museum scupturing, though it was freezing.  Well worth the visit."
74,2.0,"not really good, repeated stuff. you can click only some picture on predefined spots. Nothing to explore or fun, just click click and click"
75,4.0,"Our family spent two hours there.  It's fun for everybody.  We got there early around 10am when it just opened.  So we had plenty of time in each spot.  It's app was downloaded at the entrance and the special of effect will pop out when you took pictures.  A small ice castle is the bonus attraction.  It's freezing inside, we couldn't bear the chill.  We walked in and out right after."
76,3.0,Interesting photos you can take. Lots of fun trying to act out the photos. You will have a lot of fun.
77,5.0,We had a good time here with our kids. Using trickeye mobile app is a must otherwise you won't experience all the great effects with fantastic creatures and scenes. The children liked it especially much. My son could not figure out why a  fire-breathing dragon or a grinning shark became alive on my mobile's screen :))) Funny photos will be a great memory about your time in Seoul
78,5.0,"A Seoul must-see attraction is a visit to Trick Eye Museum. There are so many paintings that one can pose to get the 3D effect, depending on the photographer's position and angle. It leaves to your imagination and some acting skills on how you want the photo to be presented realistically.There are sample photos at the sides you could copy to get the 3D effect. With also the Trick Eye Apps that you can download  the photographer is able to record a movie with creatures like dinosaurs, dragons moving around the subjects. He is also able to see on his phone screen special effects like moving fire, rain, bubbles, etc in the background. For only 18,000 won (SGD $23) you also get to see the Ice Museum where you see sculptures of igloos, trains, beds, toilets, pianos, bar counters, etc all in ice. By the way, it's icy cold inside, about -10 degrees C, as cold as the delivery container freezers trucks carrying meat. Not recommended for young children & the elderly. Something classic and extraordinary if you can withstand the cold. The sculptures are fantastic and realistic!."
79,5.0,"Enjoyable fun filled afternoon at the Trick Eye Museum. Wasnt expecting much but the experience really surpassed all expectation. Really had a great time taking pictures with 3D effect. The only problem is the trick eye app, it gives you unclear images compare to the phone camera. This is a must visit place for both kids and adults alike"
80,4.0,"It was fun for the kids with a great app you can download, which transforms the still artwork into animated masterpieces. The staff were great and the optical. Illusions funny. There is also a small ice museum.at the bottom which was very cold."
81,4.0,This is my 3rd visit to Seoul and my first overseas adventure with my kids! It was during December 2016 and I thought it would be good to have some indoor activities as the weather was really quite cold :p I think I made the right choice! The place is easily accessible (we took a taxi there) and there are a lot of small eateries located just outside the building. The paintings are so realistic and my kids had some much fun taking pictures! The price of the ticket also include entrance to the Ice Museum which is located within the same building but we didn't stay for long as it was near to dinner time and it is really small and nothing much in there for us to see.
82,1.0,An indoor place to take fake photos. Totally corny. Perhaps I'm spoiled having seen ice sculptures at Chena Hot Springs. These were sub par to me.
83,5.0,"Location is convenient in town.But if you play creative expression, you can shoot very interesting photos, although the moment put some action when there is a little embarrassing, because a lot of people next to see, but after returning to see The photo feels like a nice remembrance."
84,4.0,I wasn't too excited about visiting this museum since I thought it was for kids. Well guess what?! My sister and I ended up having too much fun and stayed way longer than we expected. It was a bit crowded in the afternoon so we had to often wait for our turn to take pictures. Prepare to be silly and take funny pictures! This museum is so much fun that I want to go again. :)
85,4.0,"Our 7 year old had a great time posing for all the photos, and it was larger than I expected.  There is a bit of nudity in a few of the displays, but nothing obscene."
86,4.0,The paint and artwork is so well made. You can take the funniest pictures there. Really awesome 3D attraction. We had a blast. A fun place to visit!
87,3.0,"If you have some spare time and you are roaming around Hongae around, it is a good place to visit. Typical place that you will take lots of photos."
88,5.0,"Trickeye museum is some distance from Hongik University station.  It is at the basement of a building with the love museum which is not accessible to children.   Some of the paintings at Trickeye are faded due to people touching or leaning against them.  There is no clear sign on the floor to show the photographer where to stand to take the photos.  However,  there were photos on the wall so that we could figure how we should take the photos.   There is no reentry after you exit the museum.  However you should visit the Ice museum which is part of the ticket for Trickeye museum.  Make sure you are warmly clad.  Even with our winter clothing,  it was cold.  Not a big museum but nice to see an ice living room,  kitchen and toilet,  all carved from ice."
89,3.0,Have visited other similar places before. I would say this is not the most impressive one .  The place is also quite old.
90,5.0,Great combination of visual trickery. Easy to find and cheap. At this time of the year it was empty. Told that in high season it is very popular and busy. The ice area is also quite good
91,4.0,"The Trickeye Museum and Ice museum are in the same building, and the admission tickets include both places. The place isn't big but packed with people when we're there.You can really do some cool photo/illusion pictures. We had fun."
92,5.0,"Definitely a great place not to be missed if you are travelling with family with children.  Just need to let your hair down and have fun taking all the fun shots with family members. We had lots of laughter together throughout the tour. Entrance ticket was 15k‚Ç© for adult and 12k‚Ç© for 3 to18years old, which has access to both Trick eye and Ice museum. The ice museum comes with a slide that is a small thrill for both child and adult. The room is -8¬∞, so definitely can't stay inside for too long. As we are with our children, we did not go for the Adult museum, which requires separate entrance ticket. A must try if you are planning a visit to Hongdae."

94,3.0,I came here on my first visit to seoul in 2014. It was my first experience in a trick-eye museum. Lots of funny things to do inside especially for creative people. There's also an ice museum if I remembered correctly. It was really cold inside. An activity that you might want to consider when you are at the Hongdae area.
95,4.0,Not easy to find it since it doesn't seem like a museum at all from the outside . It's inside a regular apartment building. Got some cool shots though :)
96,4.0,"Our first trip to Trickeye Museum. We went there early and there was no crowd. Hence, we do not need to wait for our turns to take pictures. The place is rather small and we finished within an hour. The cleaner lady was so friendly and she even helped us take family shot."
97,5.0,"Spent an afternoon here and fun with the kids.  If you enjoy taking pictures you will enjoy this place.  Its fun, creative and sometime even challenging as you try to get your position just right."
98,4.0,"Good fun taking pictures! It was just crowded when we initially got there about 10:30-11 in the morning, since 2 tour buses arrived at the same time. It was hard to take pictures and it was warm with all the people. Admission was 15,000KRW and you could go in the Trickeye, ice and carnival museum. Their ice and carnival museum were small, but still fun. You had to pay extra to play the games in the carnival museum. As we were done going to the ice museum, we noticed that there were way less people. So maybe it's better to go around lunch time to early afternoon. They also have lockers available for 50KRW, it's very helpful since you only need a camera and you don't need to keep putting your things on the side when taking pictures."
99,4.0,"Trick Eyes is a place that you can take your picture with 3d effect on it. It's very famous, and have lot of branches in Asia cities.The place is kind of small, but it's very fun. We have lot of laugh when taking a picture and especially after looking at the result. They have a good explanatory with pictures in how you supposed to take the picture.In admission ticket, they also include admission to Ice Museum.Direction to this attraction : stop at Hongik University station (line 2, exit 9) > go straight 150m, cross the road, and turn left onto Hongik-ro Street > go straight 120m, and turn right down the second side street (in between TONYMOLY and Holika Holika) > continue going 100m to arrive at Trickeye Museum on the right.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
100,4.0,Great fun to take silly photos.  My kids loved posing and cropping and pasting to Social feed - always get lots of likes.
101,5.0,Trickeye Museum was a fun place for us to visit and take pictures. There was quite a lot of optical illusions and other picture backgrounds for us to appropriately pose and get photographed. Recommended.
102,4.0,"Conveniently located museum, reasonably priced. Try to go early in the day, as it may get crowded later on. Many interesting exhibits and do take as many photos as possible. Can combine a ticket with the Ice museum which is located within the same premises"
103,5.0,"This was an amazing trip with a family with kids 2yrs, 9trs and a teenager and grandma.Amazing tricky way to have a unforgettable pictures."
104,3.0,"I am sure when this place opened it was great, but it seems pretty run down. It was dirty, sticky, and there were pieces of the maze that were broken or missing. I felt like I needed a shower after I left. The kids enjoyed it of course. Just bring hand sanitizer!"
105,5.0,u will love it their are 3 museums together trickeye/ love / frozenu will like all of them please bring a camera for trieye + take many pictures.
106,1.0,Tourist trap and way over priced! My 13 and 15 year old went to it and they said some of the things are inappropriate.  Might be more suited for adults.
107,3.0,"It's a fun place to make use of yr camera ^^ if you hv free time & tired of shopping, then this can be a place for u. They hv 3 museums in 1 place ""Trick eye, Ice & Love museums"" (only love museum, u must be 18 above). I hv been to a few similar museums, this (is not) one of the best to said highly recommend to everyone but it wasn't that bad either. Two big issues i find really annoying are 1. not all scene comes with ""standing spot for you to take a proper shot"" 2. A few scenes are too close to each other, meaning u hv to crop a few thing out. Anyway like i said the overall isn't that bad, i would still recommend if u comes with young kids but don't put yr expectation too high. ^^"
108,5.0,"the museum is hidden in a busy shopping street. Sometime you may pass by without seeing it. I have a good time there. Beware that lots of children in this attraction so try to avoid the peak hour during the afternoon if you would like some quiet time. Beside, i recommend that you go there a later time of the day may be one or two hour before the closing time. That way, you may have a better surrounding for your photo. One last tips, try to get the ticket online to avoid the line. I booked from TravoAsia, u may download the app or go to their web site. they have discount tickets for many attraction, but they also update quiet often on the discount, Good luck and have fun."
109,3.0,The museum is located in a very moderate location with no parking facilities and without wheel chair access. It is not a proper tourist facility
110,5.0,"Love, love this place! The illusion tend to make you giggle as you see their effect in your pictures. Recommended, especially if you have great amount of time to kill!"
111,3.0,"When we visited the museum, my son was still sleeping in his stroller thus my husband did not enter the museum as advised by our tour guide it is not stroller friendly. There is one mirror maze which stroller could not enter in the museum."
112,5.0,"This place was seriously hilarious... I went with my parents and two sisters and my jaws were aching from laughing so much. The entrance fee was 15,000 won and it took us about 2 hours or so to see the whole place. It was lucky we went early because when we came out there were crowds (of mainly students and young kids). The ice museum was ridicously FREEZING!! It was minus 11!! We literally ran round the place and took as many pictures as we could possibly manage, went down the ice slide and was out as quick as a flash. For those (like me) who use DSLR cameras or even those with compact cameras, be aware of the fogging on your lenses when going into or out of the ice museum.There was so much variety of imaginative paintings, sculptures and other exhibits that were amazing and looked great on the photos and videos. There were lockers at the entrance of the museum that costs 500 won, which was a blessing because we carried a few bags.We kind of got lost trying to find this place and when we eventually finished at the musuem and were on the way back to the subway station, we realised we took the longest detour ever. So here's the easy way to get to the museum from the subway...From Hongik University Station, take exit number 9... walk straight until you get to a big road, with McDonald's on one side and Forever 21 opposite, turn left into that road. Take the first right (next to theTony moly shop) where there's a street of shops and keep walking straight, the moment you see a colourful statue of a man in a carriage, then trickeye museum is on the right hand side."
113,5.0,"TICKETS/PRICING: 15000 for adults (18+), kids are lower.The ticket includes both the Trickeye and Ice Museums.TRICKEYE: I honestly expected only a few photo ops here and there, BUT MAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF EXHIBITS! I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep it simple- there are lots of sculptures and paintings that are amazing, hilarious, and gorgeous. There are a few inappropriate ones, so take caution when bringing kids! When I went, there were waves of Chinese tourists coming in, so I had to wait to take a picture for some of the spots (just beware if you're going in the summer). Spent about 2 hours.ICE MUSEUM: You're given a blanket-poncho before going in because this place is super cold; negative degrees Celsius. It's a small exhibit, which is okay because my family just wanted to snap a picture and get the heck out of there! If you can't handle the cold, this isn't for you! I had some fun as there was a mini icehouse and a slide. Overall, quick but fun experience.OTHER: Before entering the actual museums, there are lockers (500KRW), restrooms with multiple stalls, a bubble tea shop, a dining area, game room (like a mini carnival), caricatures (15000-25000), and hanbok dressing (20000 for renting the dress and using the background settings for photos, 5000 for hair, 15000 for makeup). Personally, I enjoyed wearing the hanbok and taking pictures!- just another touristy thing to do! My sister got the caricatures and didn't like it because it didn't resemble her, so that was a downside. Overall, my family had a great time taking pictures with these amazing optical illusions! Afterwards, you can visit the Love Museum (adults only) or go shopping right around the corner!"
114,5.0,"Good for family , solo, group travellers. Fee applies for entry into the museum and the ticket is used also for entry to the adjacent ice museum. Trick eye museum has the spots earmarked from where the photographs are to be taken to get the tricked photos. Ice museum temperatures are near to -7 deg C. Those who have  allergy to severe cold are not advised to go in there."
115,4.0,"Take your camera and get ready to have fun. This museum was fun and had quite a bit of variety for all to include an ice exhibit. The ice exhibit was extremely cold and would have been better if they had coats or at least a warning, but it was part of the fun. It wasn't too large, so we weren't cold for very long. The remainder of the museum was fun and I recommend it."
116,5.0,"My sisters and I had fun taking pictures and laughing at the same time. This museum is very creative and well thought of. I hope that they 'll create more illusions in the future :)The staff were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. Because I enjoyed this attraction/ museum, I plan to visit the other branches as well :)"
117,3.0,"It was a fun and unique experience I guess. Wife wife and daughter enjoyed it.  There are many different places to pose, take photos, etc.  There is a little mirror maze to exit.  Don't forget to check out the Ice Museum.  It was different. Ice cold sculptures and a little slide just for kicks LOL.  The girls had fun so I had fun as well."
118,4.0,The kids loved Trickeye museum and taking all the photos. Ice sculptures on the same floor was nice too.
119,3.0,Go early. We went an hour before closing time and we were not able to see the carnival museum. Fun for everyone especially kids. 3D paintings are average; its really up to your drama skills to make the paintings alive and more interesting.
120,4.0,I liked the idea of the museum it was funny tricky and we enjoyed our time but we faced little difficulty to know how to take the right photo if there is a guide or better instructions will be easier
121,4.0,This was a fun diversion! I had never been to a museum like this before but we had a ton of fun taking photos and admiring the clever 3D optical illusions!
122,4.0,Lots of trickeye photo spots.  A good hour or 2 of photo taking.  Hardest part was probably locating the building.  Its within the alleys of Hongdae.
123,5.0,I loved every bit of this museum. It was so funny and our pictures turned out to be extremely hilarious. They have so many funny 3D images inside and you can get yourself clicked at every step. Don't go there alone as you would need a companion to get yourself clicked. There was an ice museum also which was perfect to go and have a look at. It was quite cold inside so we were simply in a hurry to click the photographs and come out soon. But it was definitely worth a visit. It took us about 3 hours to cover the entire museum. I would highly recommend this museum if you are seeking for some super fun in korea. I already have such lovely and funny memories captured with me. Go have fun guys. Good luck!!! :)
124,5.0,This museum was a fun surprise. It was included in our combo ticket and we thought we would give it a try at the conclusion of the Seoul Tower (since it is located at the base of the tower). Photography is encouraged and visitors become part of the artwork. Allow 45 minutes to visit both exhibit halls.
125,4.0,Very good for all sort of age. U can have fun by taking photo that look so real. Kid definitely love this place with so much activities and fun.
126,4.0,This is a great place to visit though a bit difficult to find. plenty of photo opportunities that made you worth your while coming here.
127,3.0,"It is a trickeye museum cum ice museum. Many photo opportunities.  Quite alot of tourists.  Discount vouchers are only valid for adults, not valid for children.  The museum is not very big, we exit within 1 hour.  We find the price more expensive than Alive museum."
128,4.0,"Took the kids here after walking around all day. Got there about an hour before closing. It is not the most obvious of locations and needed to use GPS to find the building. The building is set back in a section of streets filled with cafes and bars. But it's seoul, so we felt comfortable walking around in there late at night. Once in, go to the basement floor. The fee is a bit steep and you really need to work with the comers angles to make the pictures look like its intended to."
129,1.0,"The ""museum"" is 3D selfies backdrops with a 15000 won entry fee for it and the ""Ice sculpture museum"".  Not the kind of business model that would work outside of Asia, I think.... but twenty-somethings here love it."
130,3.0,Trick Eye is a good place to kill an hour or so.  The smallish space is packed with optical illusion backgrounds.  We had lots of fun posing with these and took heaps of photos.  We also visited ice world (same building and part of the price) which was very good.  We visited Trick Eye on a cold winters night.  The street shopping in the area are awesome but it was a welcome relief to be indoors.
131,3.0,"The museum consists of many backdrops where visitors can pose and in photographs it will look like they are floating on a magic carpet or in the mouth of a giant fish.  The kids (ages 8 and 11) thought it was hilarious, but it was sort of expensive."
132,4.0,If you like to take photos & post in social media then this is the place to be!!! It's a different kind of experience.
133,4.0,"I am surprise to see this museum is quite small if compare to Singapore's, One very significant different is there is an adult trick eye museum beside it, only for 18+, other than that I would prefer Singapore's one, there are bigger and more.However children will love this. Inside there are still a lot of funs.Outside the trick eye museum is a shopping street, lots of thing on sales."
134,5.0,"You will be surprise how creative you can be to have your photo taken... this doesn't apply to kids but also to granny! I can see almost every visitors will try their very best to pose for their picture to be taken... and most of the expressions are really creative!.Ice Museum is about -10deg inside and there is a slide made of ice where the kids will not get tired nor they will feel cold as they run up again to slide down... excitement and running up the ice-stairs keep them warm :)Nonetheless, do note that they do not allow re-entry for both Trickeye and Ice Museum."
135,5.0,The package comes with ice museum too.  Print out discount coupon that offer to the foreigners. Hongik university street is just nearby too
136,4.0,It was interesting and fun place to spend time with children and young couple. Essentially it is a 3-D templates that was designed such that you can use your imagination to create interesting photos. You need a creative mind to see all the angles and how it will turn out on photographs. Few samples were given but the challenge is for you to find new angles and ideas. Overall the place provides a lot of fun times with your camera and hand-phones. It is also I think better to go as group as certain props require more than 2 person to pose.
137,2.0,"Many recommended this place but I found it fairly childish.Some of the tricks are a little funny, but most are either silly , or rude, or simply boring.I ended up walking through the place fairly quickly.Not recommended."
138,4.0,A good place to experiment with your photography and test your creativity.  One has to invest a few minutes in order to compose a shot that will look so real when viewed on the screen.
139,5.0,"Just a joyful place with lots of to try. Don't forget to bring your camera with you. It could be adviceable to prepare for a cold...very cold experience, too...if one likes to do a visit."
140,4.0,"Great place to kill a few hours in a trendy college neighborhood. Take your camera and have some fun with the backgrounds and props. When you've had enough inside, stroll through the neighborhood shops and look for trendy, inexpensive items or duck into one of the many cafes and restaurants for a delicious meal."
141,5.0,Something fun to do and take pictures. They have amazing artwork ‚ù§ make sure to take your time to look around. They also have an Ice museum make sure you wear warm clothes as it is very cold.
142,5.0,"This is a museum which is easy to find (located in Hongdae) and you can spend hours inside it.Apart from Trickeye, you can also visit the Love Museum (B1, just above Trickeye which is at B2) - but this is for adults only as it is a sexual theme museum."
143,5.0,Go as group of 3 or more as many things you meed the third person to shoot camera for the other two. One of the nice places in seoul one of the must to be seen.
144,5.0,"I LOVEDDddddd this museum. I took so many cool photos, got creative and laughed a lot. Got tired too of taking so many photos. There are two things you have to remember though: make sure you take a map when finding the place since its location is kinda hard to find specially if you don't speak Korean. Also, make sure to go there during the week. I heard weekends are crowded and you will have a hard time taking photos since it is a small museum anyway. But it worths the money. Definitely recommend it. They gave us coupons for restaurants near there too!"
145,5.0,It's way more fun when you don't need to wait a long time for each picture. It's a very fun place if you're willing to be silly.
146,3.0,"This is small museum, if you have 15000‚Ç© just laying around somewhere and 5 minutes to spare this is the place to be. Not very much interesting stuff."
147,4.0,"Didn't realize taking pics could be so much fun til I visited this place. Saw some pics like these before but thought they were photoshopped. Turned out they only tricked my eyes. However, the distance between each pic is so narrow plus the crowd made it so challenging to get a good pic. Nonetheless, it was worth visiting. 1 hour is not enough so better prepare your batteries."
148,3.0,"Fun for kids, not worth $13 for adults. Make one take them in for an hour while other adults get a break in the cool college area."
149,5.0,"Great getaway in Seoul. It's hidden away and in the basement, but what a fun we had. Two kids 9 and 10. Bring your camera. You'll have plenty pics afterwards to use for invitations or postcards back home."
150,5.0,"the museum featuring 2-D and 3-D illustrations create opportunities for visitors to take a photo their companions in wacky situations. With that, 2-D paintings on the museum walls, floors and ceilings appear to pop out of the surface and come to life. Step inside the paintings to complete a visual narrative with your creative poses. At Trick Eye Museum, you‚Äôll be creating unforgettable memories with friends and family amid fun and laughter."
151,5.0,"We were there with friends probably for 2-3 hours, very funny when taking photos out there. The museum were very crowed all the time. However we had a great great time together. P.s. After long photo trip in Trick eyes, there is a korean grill buffet nearby. That's my favourite!Tips :- Go at least 4-5 people, absolutely fun.- Do not shy to help people taking photo and ask them in return because they may wait for you to help."
152,4.0,Fun photo taking place.. but can be crowded.We took a taxi there but couldn't find the location initially.
153,3.0,"We visited the museum on a monsoon Saturday and it was fun for the afternoon. Since it closes late we got there at 4. The crowd definitely diminished by 5 but we went through with a lot of folks which is a hassle because everyone is backing into everyone else's photos. This museum is ONLY ABOUT TRICK PHOTOS, my husband didn't know that and was a little disappointed with the experience. My kids however couldn't stop the ""Mom, take a picture of me there"" bit! Some of the installations take a little thinking to figure out how to do a good photo, and thankfully almost all of them have ""sample photos"" which helps you know what to do. It's a good diversion but fairly difficult to find. Fortunately it's in a hip neighborhood with tons of restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques as well as retail stores so there is plenty to do as you try to find your way to the museum. The entrance is a small kiosk at ground level so definitely look it up on Google Maps to know what you're looking for."
154,5.0,"Being situated in Hongdae, keep a lookout for Trickeye Museum as it is located basement, and you will only see the staircase on the streets. Very interactive exhibits and they changed the exhibits from the last time (one year ago) I came. Worth coming a trip for families, couples, and friends. Lockers are available for you to keep your belonginsgs, bring only your cameras! (preferably no flash, ample light in the museum) Be quirky and expressive, keep those photos as a memory for this wonderful experience."
155,4.0,"I have visited several times over past two years and every time I go there are different exhibits. Not all exhibits were different but they do rotate a lot of them so is different each time. Best time to go if during the day on a week day. Evenings,  weekends and Korean holidays can be quite crowded, making it almost impossible to take photos. Photos of yourself and others in your group are the reason for going, so it would be pointless to go alone."
156,4.0,This place is fun for those who like taking fun photos.They also have ice museum inside so it's good place to have family outing.
157,4.0,"It's magic in photos, a camera trick! A chopped head in photo. Climbing a bamboo tree with a panda, riding a chariot without any effort...,etc. That's only a few what you can photograph yourself in. Take pictures in the right way and you can see it like it's the genuine one. Try to trick your eyes with a stunning believable background while in Seoul. It's really worth the try."
158,5.0,This is an interactive museum! And is especially great for taking photos while family members pose IN the art! Our whole family enjoyed our visit & we recommend everyone to visit!It is a bit hard to find. Its down a tiny alley that is across the street from H&M. (The alleyway)There is very limited parking so try to find a spot along the street somewhere or take the train. A MUST SEE & DO IN SEOUL!
159,5.0,This place is great. Make sure you have plenty of memory and battery on your camera/phone because you'll be taking a tonne of pictures. And the ice bit was new from the last time we visited and it was great fun too.
160,5.0,"Cool place, not terribly priced, expect 2-3 hours depending on the crowds and how much you like to take pictures... you will have those overzealous types jump in front of you or just walk right past or take 1000 pictures to get that right one. When you encounter them, just skip ahead a couple displays bc you will become frustrated waiting at every single display."
161,4.0,"Trick Eye Museum in Hongdae Seoul is an art gallery where 2D images are created to give the illusion of 3D. It is one of the most popular tourist destination & voted as No # 1 Museum on Trip advisor. There are many trompe l‚Äôoeil installations that give an illusion of 3D images. People from all age groups can enjoy this place. So bring out your funny side, smile & pose :)The museum is divided into eight exhibits based on different themes. Make sure you have enough time to visit all the sections & take millions of pictures :)."
162,4.0,"We printed out a voucher from the internet and we were able to get discounts for the entrance. We only paid 12000 won each. There was a man guiding us on how to pose and get good pictures. We had great fun posing and goofing around. All of our pictures turned out great. The ice museum was small , nice and very cold."
163,3.0,"The Trickeye museum was a good place to visit after our disappointment at the palaces.  We were there for about 1.5 hours taking pictures, some of which were pretty decent while other backgrounds were not as realistic as you would think.  Overall quality was pretty good.  The tickets were good for also the ice museum, which is a small indoor freezer that has a few ice sculptures and a slide.  Kids will like it, but it is super cold inside."
164,5.0,"Had an awesome experience clicking pictures in 3D. Each piece of work is outstanding. First of all it is located in the Hodae area very close to Hongik University, which itself is such a great place to be. Secondly, each photo that we clicked came up so well that even we were surprised to see if its real ! lol . If you are not shy posing weirdly in public, its the right place to be. Make sure you have a good camera, ample time for clicking pictures, and some warm clothes for the ice museum (its inside the Trickeye museum and quite small ). Only drawback is some cheezy people that you may encounter who just try to block the paintings and artefacts so that you dont rush in before them which was funny...but otherwise its a great place to be..even our 1 year old baby thoroughly enjoyed it !!"
165,4.0,Bring your camera to take lots of photos! There are lots of different backdrops that allow you to appear in strange places. It gets really crowded so try to go early if you can on a weekday.
166,5.0,"Perfect for a rainy day. The Trickeye Museum is fun for all ages, especially those who like to take lots of pictures. Definitely bring a camera!"
167,4.0,"It was our 3rd day in Seoul when we paid a visit  at Trickeye and Ice Museum at Hongdae. This is one attraction mostly frequented by both local and foreign tourists,.Regardless of age, this one can be enjoyed by anyone. We had a great time of having different posing at various 3D paintings, filled with fun and all were results of unusual optical illusions, indeed very amazing.That's why, we decided to come up with a photo-book out of many shots from this place alone and a truly nice photo album full of memories of the recent travel and visit in South Korea to such wonderful attraction, which we will treasure in our lives.I therefore say that a trip to Seoul without dropping by the Trick-eye and Ice Museum is simply a failure. Try and see for yourselves...."
168,4.0,we spent hours there... just to take photos at different angles...The kids love the art and ice museum is small but interesting... they even have the ice slides.. The love museum is so-so but it came as a package for the Triceye museum....
169,5.0,"lots of trickeye pictures for your to take the photos. They had a sample picture to explain which corner to can take the best picture.Would like to go to sex trickeye museum, unfortunately did not have enough time.Outside the museum, it is a shopping area. It will be less people in the morning."
170,5.0,"We were thinking of visiting the Trickeye in Singapore but glad that we did the trick eye museum in Seoul, the original home of Trickeye. Bought the tickets through Funtastic Korea, at 11,000W per person it is the cheapest i can find, www.funtastickorea.comWe went on a Saturday, a bit of crowd but not too bad, basically we have the chance to take most pictures we want without having to wait for too long. The pleasant surprise was the ice museum, sort of 'little Harbin ice carving"", very interesting. Kids love the carved ice-slides which they could physically slide down too, they went many rounds of it. Overall spent about 2+ hours including the ice museum.Hongdae is a nice place to explore, trendy and fashionable. For cheaper food go nearer to Hongik University, it's possible to find decent food offer at 3,000-4,500W; which cater mainly to local university students."
171,5.0,nice place for picture taking but its crowded. the tickets is inclusive of ice museum entrance as well...
172,4.0,Liked: It was fun and cool. My daughters had fun taking pictures.Disliked: There were no lines when you want to take pictures. It's not very orderly. You have to be very patient when others try to cut in.
173,4.0,"We went with a tour guide, who helped buy real discounted entrance fee of KRW9,000 for both museums.Upon entering the building, we felt the heat, so instantly rented a locker (KRW500) to store our thick winter clothes, but hold on, don't rent it because ice museum is so freezing cold!  Brrrr..... you'll definitely need those warm clothes!The younger ones all loved the ice slide.  It was good that we went early on a weekday, so the queue wasn't that long and the museum wasn't crowded.  There were Cinderella's carriage, igloo  and other striking structures including a pair of large wings with a seat in the middle for one to sit on, so it would appear that you've huge ice wings.Regarding the other bigger museum with the artworks and exhibits, we enjoyed ourselves immensely here.  We (3 generations) had much laughter.  Though this museum was more crowded compared to the other and no photo could be taken without some strangers inside, we still had a good time.  This couldn't be avoided since everybody wanted to have a share in the interesting artwork and exhibits.  Nobody minded the 'photo-crashing'.A word of warning:  While exiting this museum, you'd need to walk through a mirror maze.  Use your hand to reach out to make sure that it's actually a small passageway and not a mirror wall.  Why am I writing this?  Because my young grandson (4 years old) wanted to be independent to do it on his own.  He banged his head extremely hard against one mirror wall and it hurt so badly he cried for quite a while.I missed visiting Love Museum because I had to babysit my grandchildren, so no comments there.Well, for fun-loving families, this is certainly the place to visit!"
174,3.0,"We went with our children ages 7 and 9 a few days before Christmas. We payed full price of 15,000 per adult which included the small ice museum too. Taking pictures wasn't easy with so many people everywhere so the cool trick eye affect will have to be done with picture editing to get all the people in many of the backgrounds out. My kids have fun posing but it takes so long waiting for other people to finish and get far enough out of the way. My kids enjoyed the small ice museum best. It is small, freezing, and packed with people. No one was regulating how many people were in ready there and a bunch of older boys kept going down the short ice slide. My husband couldn't wait to get out it was so cold even with all our winter gear on. Kids liked pics in the car, Santa's sleigh and igloo. But again, so packed could hardly really enjoy the place.   The streets around outside are wonderful though and I highly recommend walking around night or day in that area."
175,5.0,Try to print the discount voucher online before visiting this place.Awesome for all ages. The Trickeye museum also include the ice museum. Value for money. 2-3 hrs will be good.
176,5.0,"Loved the quirky art and paintings on display. Very well done and very tricky. Deserving of the name Trickeye! Please do remember to look for discount coupons before going. It's not really worth it to pay the full amount when you can find discounts with some research. They also throw in the Ice Museum entrance when we were there. Maybe coz it was winter and nobody in their right mind would pay to go in there. It's absolutely freezing and even with our thick winter wear, we could not survive in there for more than 15mins. So for those of you going in summer, please remember to bring jackets or you won't survive more than 5 mins. It's kinda fun with the icy slide and the ice car and ice cinderella carriage but I honestly would not pay extra to go in.(Please do not ask me where to find the discounts. Research on Google. It's there for you to find if you put in some effort.)"
177,4.0,"Interesting place to visit with family. Place is easy to locate in Hongdae area. You can explore the Hongdae area after your visit to the museum,"
178,4.0,"This is a fantastic place to spend some time indoors and have some fun.  Both the kids & the adults had a great time posing for the pictures.  The exit of the museum is a mirror maze and with the same ticket, you get free entry to the ice museum where the kids had further fun sliding down an ice slide & more photo opportunities with some ice sculpture."
179,5.0,"I went before 10am to avoid the crowd and cuz of jetlag. Take the subway and get off Hongik University station Exit 9. Take a right, when you see the light turn left you will see Tony Moly shop and Tourist Info Center across the street. The museum is located in the alley street in basement area.  Trickeye museum cost 15,000 won ($13 depending on exchange rate). There were only few people inside and we follow the path to take all pictures.  They even posted sample pictures so you will know how to pose. It's a fun place to spend a couple hours.  The ice museum is included in the ticket.  By the time we were done a group of tour came in, so I suggest go early."
180,4.0,"wow, u can take so many amazing photos here~ but when i got there, so many people.... i have no place to take good photos... so sad...my advice is , u can go to other trickeye museum or alive museum, don't come in if there is so many people. or you will waste time to wait !"
181,5.0,You should bring along a tripod to take full photos. Otherwise you would totally miss out someone in photos LOLWe had been there for over 3 hours coz we took every each pictures <3
182,4.0,"It's pretty much the same like what we have here in the Philippines. All you need is a wide imagination, good camera and a photographer."
183,4.0,"Good photo taking experience with my kid. Very interesting picture poses staging, but after a while, almost similar in all the staging and my child get bored eventually. The ice museum is cold environment, for Asians I think, I overheard one Asian traveller said she can't go further into the museum and has to exit after a brief visit."
184,5.0,Lots of fun photo opportunities and worth the cost. Took us about an hour to work through the whole thing and taking lots of pictures.
185,4.0,"the visual effect is amazing, we had so much fun taking pictures there! The staff are also helpful and nice!"
186,3.0,Nothing to shout about for this place. Its almost the same as all the rest of these similar trickeye museums around the world. Not very impressive nor was it really big to shout about.. Can be a missed if you have ever been to one of these trickeye museums before.
187,5.0,You need to be at least three or more people to visit and make the most out of trick-picture taking when visiting...
188,5.0,Expect at least 2 hours to enjoy this place as you will be wanting to take back good memories along with catchy photos. people fromm all ages can enjoy themself here. Getting yourself here alone will be quite a challenge though as you need someone to take your photos and you really dont want to disturb others while they are also busy taking their own photos.
189,3.0,"If you enjoy taking pictures, then this is the place for you to visit. They have quite a bit of unusual and unique props and canvas that you will be able to create fun and great conversation pieces."
190,4.0,"Enjoyable family entertainment but can get crowded. Better photo perspective than the similar Alive Museum. Ice Museum, although small, was a hit with the kids....too bad we couldn't keep going in & out (it's too cold to stay in too long)."
191,4.0,"If it's crowded be prepared to wait for awhile to take your photos.  Other than that, it was great.  Family and friends loved the photos we uploaded later."
192,4.0,"Entrance fee is 15000 won, but you might get a discount coupon from the Korea Tourism website for 12000 won. Even if you do not go in, there are a couple of exhibits which you and your friends or family can have fun posing and taking some pictures. Don't miss it especially if you are in Hongdae. The Love and Ice Museum are there too."
193,4.0,"Lots of fun with you are traveling with teens or kids.with some imagination you can get great shots.You you travel alone.... Don't think about, as the fun is to take the photos."
194,4.0,You travel through a pathway along the unique very photographable and fun tricks to the eye.  Very family friendly.  Very busy on weekends.  A small area to eat lunch box meal or purchase quick Korean food.
195,5.0,"Amazing paintings. Very creative. Most of the pictures looked alike, while a handful just normal. Don't miss this when you are in Seoul!"
196,3.0,a great place to juz have loads of laughter and fun! Pray that the place is not packed when you go else you will have to wait around us to take the shots!
197,4.0,Went as part of a party of 6 (aged 11 to 50) and all enjoyed it. I personally thought the Alive Museum at Insadong was better but the kids thought this was the best.Well worth a visit. Lots of interesting pictures and lots of fun creating poses. Take your time with the poses and make sure the pictures line up. After we returned home I found some photos slightly out of alignment which spoilt them.The drinks in the cafe are not up to much. There are many good places around the museum and I would recommend to go for drink outside.We got there early and it was mostly empty but soon filled up once a couple of tour buses arrived. Many of the the scenes/pictures are too close together It becomes difficult to take photos once there are many people. After a while we found ourselves skipping through some areas simply because of the crowds. If I were to go again I would plan for a weekday and be at the door as they opened.The Ice Museum is a nice addition but not very big. The kids loved the slide and the ice toilet (complete with something special)
198,3.0,"This ""museum"" is regarded as the forefather of several optical illusion places that have sprouted up in Asia in recent years. As such, I thought it would be bigger than the rest. It turns out the opposite is true. The attraction is located on an underground level in the Hongdae area. While the paintings are nice and somewhat inventive, there were too few of them in my opinion. Plus, the place becomes very crowded and cramped when tour groups come in as they do because it seemed to be a fixture of many itineraries.The Trickeye Museum is a fun diversion for people who like this sort of thing and taking amusing snapshots to show the folks back home, but I would not discard some of the more cultural and historical sites in Seoul just to show up here."
199,3.0,"I got a kick out of some of the museum, but it's not worth more than one viewing and is best seen in a group or at least as a couple."
200,4.0,"The ice museum is very new to us, and also COLD to us as well. Remember to wear a waterproof jacket before you get inside."
201,5.0,It is the place for kids and adults. Photographers could love this place for taking pictures in different ways
202,5.0,looking for soemthing natural place.This is  what are you looking for.have kid(age really does not matter for this place) ?You must go this spot.i can give my word~! You will not regret.
203,5.0,Innovative painting that trick your eye to be a 3 dimension picture on your camera. Try also ice museum. You can buy one package ticket including ice museum.
204,5.0,A fun place to spend a couple of hours. Lots of 3-D photo opportunities with a variety of themes. Best to go with a few friends and family to shoot some really fun photos. The place is always crowded so allocate at least 2 hours. The entrance ticket includes admission to the Ice Museum (be sure to take a jacket as it is freezing in there!).
205,4.0,"Maybe it was time that we visitied, but way too many people in the facility to make it really iteractive as you had people walking in front of you as you tried taking pictures."
206,4.0,"It is a good place if you like taking photos.  Outside of it has around 10 free background to try.  We played the ice museum first (as part of a package).  Though it was small, my daughter played the ice slide few times.  She liked the ice toilet most.  We could only spent 15 mins because it was really cold.  After that, we headed to the trickeye museum.  It has over 50 background with different 3D effects.  There are sample photos for you to follow.  My daughter liked to put up different postures and looked at the result and retry.  It was very entertaining for her and hence we spent more than an hour there.  The exit was also surprising as we had to look for way out in many mirrors."
207,4.0,A must visit. Something fascinating for family. Tons of photographs to take. Though some are outdated. Maybe they would upgrade. The ice museum which comes as a package was a disaster. Too bloody cold. The protective sheet did not serve it's purpose. The sculptures were unimaginative.
208,5.0,"Absolutely love the 3D art here! let my imagination run wild & had so much fun posing with the 3D paintings! The museum is not so prominent though(it is located in a building basement).The entrance was right behind me & I'm still looking around for it(Hint: It's located right at the end of a row of shops).There's also a ice exhibit in the museum, kids will enjoy it the most."
209,5.0,"Fun to go! We have a lot of fun there.As you can also  go to the ice museum, remember to bring enough clothes! it is very cold inside! The blanket for rent is ugly and not warm enough"
210,4.0,Nice place. Just be alert. Very hard to locate. A must see when in seoul. Surrounding area is also a tourist spot. Lots of places to eat. Subway is just a few meters away.
211,5.0,"will see how magic is the paint over wall tricky,very recommendedthis place for simply funny, enjoy it. nothing else."
212,5.0,"Went there with the family and it was great fun! Took lots of pictures with the paintings. It's really up to your imagination as to how to compose the photos and where you want to stand, sit, lie down for the pics.Everyone enjoyed the experience greatly!"
213,4.0,Our grandaughter chose to go there.  It was a fun experience!  Probably wouldn't bother without kids unless you had tons of free time!
214,4.0,"Wow. It was incredible.  With the right angle, photos come alive in an instant.   We had trouble finding the place though, Google map brought us to the Seoul City Hall which was in another part of town.  So please bring the brochure with you if youre taking a cab.  you can also ask your hotel concierge for subway directions."
215,5.0,"I loved the ice museum even though it was really cold as we went at night. There are many great spots to take funny photos of your friends and family, well worth going"
216,4.0,Its a 3D art museum hidden at B2 of a run down building. A must see for tourist to Seoul. Plenty of photo opportunity.
217,4.0,"Great afternoon spent in this museum with amazing photo ops. Go and see for yourself, Don't forget to pose for a good one!"
218,4.0,"Not a good idea if you are coming alone, need at least 2 people to go here since the highlight is experimenting in taking pictures. I went with 2 siblings and we spent a good 2 hours having fun taking many pictures."
219,5.0,I've been to other museums but this place is very fun and enjoyable especially for the little ones.the naked eye it looks ordinary but after you take the picture you could really see the big difference in the 3d feature
220,5.0,"There are other places that you may find art tricks but I find this one well planned. It's easier to take photos and make it appear realistic. i like that this is located near a University making it accessible to students. It's also interesting that though there were so many people when we were inside, but amazingly, they were nice enough to allow you to have your space and time in a particular art."
221,5.0,It's very good art creation that ever..... you and your family can enjoy the art creation that make anybody surprise with the affect of the picture you made.
222,4.0,"Located in the Hongkik University area, the Trickeye Museum was a little smaller than I expected but also includes a trip inside an even smaller Ice Museum (I could have described this wrong but you get my drift).  And since it is located in the Hongkik University Area at least you get to see a lot in a single trip.  There is a similar ""museum"" (more like a very large room) in Lotte World, the trip to Trickeye Museum and here I would say, combines for more than satisfying pictures of 3D artistic, fun.  My mistake was to tell my children no to waste time in Lotte World's version because we were going to the Trickeye Museum anyway - I was wrong.  Note:  Since the Trickeye Museum isn't exactly a huge place, it could get frustrating when there are a lot of people.  I am not sure if the management regulates entry - they should.  Our experience in terms of the crowd and their behavior, I would say was fair to good."
223,4.0,"Great place for some fun and photo taking. Went on a weekend and it was extremely packed, making photo taking quite difficult. The crowd were mainly non-Koreans so I suspect the weekdays maybe similarly packed. The management really should impose a limit on the number of people entering the museum at any one time."
224,4.0,"I visited the museum at Hongdae. Very fun and interesting concept, a place for you to take many photos and the Ice Museum is very nice!"
225,5.0,The area to take pictures are a little bit near to each other but the idea of the place is awesome. The ICE museum next to it is already open and the tickets is included too. Get the voucher from online before you go there and you will be entitled to a discount. Do visit the Trickeye first because you'll be sweating after many vigrous shots then continue to cool down at the ICE museum!
226,5.0,"My family enjoyed this place the most among all attractions visited in Seoul. There's something for all ages & culture. There's photo beside each display to teach you how to pose for the best effects.Remember to visit the Ice Museum too, though small, kids will love the ice slide."
227,4.0,"e went there on weekend on it is super packed. So try to go on weekdays. It is fun if you go with families n friends but definitely not going alone since nobody can take pic of you. Paid 15,000 for both admission to Trickeye museum and Ice museum. Totally worth it. After we exited from the museum, I grabbed a magazine on the magazine rack  beside the admission counter. It is called ""In Seoul"", there is 3000 won discount coupon inside. Not sure the coupon is available every month or not. Oh, well, so the next time you remember to grab the magazine and find your coupon before paying."
228,4.0,"This was the pick of my 17 year old son.  We really had fun posing at the pictures.  It is setup so you look like you are part of the art on the wall.  You look like you are riding a camel, driving a car, being eaten by a monster, etc.  It is small, took us about 1 hour to tour, but we had lots of laughs.  I can image during the busy tourist season it would be hard to pose at the pictures, but we were there in January and got to spend our time with very few people there.  It is on a small street in Hongdae.  Use the websites directions, super easy to find if you follow them.  If you are in the area, make a stop and enjoy being a ""piece of art"" for a little while."
229,3.0,"Trickeye Museum is a great stop to make if you're going to be visiting Hongdae. It's not worth making a special trip to visit though. I think this museum concept is catching on in Korea because they've changing the Teddy Bear Museum to be a trickeye museum up at N Tower, too. While at the Trickeye, be sure to visit the Ice Museum and slide down the ice slide."
230,5.0,Visited the museum with my folks and aunt. The place had a lot of paintings that were great to take photos of. My dad and I took pictures with almost every display. Fun!
231,5.0,"excellent, interesting place to visit for kids and family and affordable too. Very hard to find, should have more signage..but again the locals are helpfull"
232,5.0,"Its really tricking my eye, great picture there, and have a new ice museum, so fun thereThey're really creative"
233,3.0,The place is in the basement. You will see a picture where if you take picture of it like live. Good but not spectacular. Is ok if you have more time but not must go. It's quite fun. They also have a little Ice castle.
234,4.0,"me and my family love the museum.there were a lot of people even in winter, lots of taking pictures with some camera trick, the angles and the paintings themselves but i wish for more tricks.but it was fun, shud give it a try in Seoul"
235,5.0,We had quite a blast in this fun attraction. We enjoyed the interactive paintings and took many photos. Would recommend this to anyone visiting Seoul for some light hearted fun.
236,4.0,"This is an eye opening for everybody especially for those photographers will love to try out their skills. It is designed from 2D, 3D and enjoy the 5D theatre"
237,4.0,"Pretty fun for young and old. Went in Dec, there was also an ice museum. All four of us have enjoyed the visit."
238,5.0,"Can have some interesting moments, were there for about 2-3 hrs. Those pictures spice up our album for the trip. We still laugh at the pictures when we go through them. Good to share with friends too."
239,3.0,"This place is best for those who have friends who could take '3D' images well, my aunt helped taken hundreds of pics yet only a few turned out acceptable. If you think you might take bad pictures, there are staff members situated nearby and they can help take a few pictures for you.Also, I find the museum a little bit boring as there aren't much to take with."
240,5.0,A quirky fun place that has little to do with Seoul or South Korea but a great place to take pictures of yourself and traveling companions.
241,4.0,"A different and fun part of Seoul! This makes a unique and fun outing..If you don't like crowds and pushing or if you always want the best pictures this place can be frustrating...however, if photo bombers aren't a problem take your kids, your friends, your camera and your imagination you'll have ablast!"
242,5.0,"A group of helpful young Koreans brought us to this place, when we were just asking for directions!  We were told that Trickeye was the older museum and we should go for Alive museum but in my opinion, Trickeye was the better one.  There were more variety and 3D stuff here vs Alive, which was more of arts and paintings (got boring after awhile).  We had lots of fun posing and laughing at the cheeky displays.  It was a good fun time for the young and old. The ticket price includes the Ice museum ... it was freezing cold inside but the kids loved the ice-carved slide. Trickeye was near the Hongaik Uni area.  Stay in this area for lunch, walk around and feel the vibrance of the area after visiting the museum."
243,5.0,"It's our 4th day in Korea in autumn, but our memory card is  almost empty as the kids are not so keen on taking photos. Not here. They gamely posed for photos, and even retaking shotswhen they're not satisfied. We had so much fun taking each other's pictures and I have discovered that my daughter has a penchant for photography, directing her little brother until she gets the perfect shot. It was a good break for my son who's not so much into the palaces. perfect for sharing at home too.Entrance fee is not cheap for 15000 won but definitely worth it. We presented the discount voucher printed from KTO website so we paid 12000 each. One voucher is good for 4."
244,5.0,it was like my second visit here but I have still enjoyed taking pictures. It has new illusions and an additional ice museum in which you can enjoy the cold breeze and slide.
245,5.0,Had the most amazing time with my mum and daughter.  WE took great photos and laughed so much.  What a brilliant idea..... would recommend this to anyone visiting Korea... bring someone with you so you can take photos of each other!!!
246,4.0,Very entertaining and some very memorable photos. Great for families with young children or teenagers.  The only disadvantage is that it was very crowded when we were there (weekday) making it very difficult to get a good photo opportunity.  The ice museum is also very entertaining but it is very cold that you cannot really spend too much time in there.
247,5.0,"a very intresting place to visit. many pictures captured in 3D painting....some are very funny painting. you have to follow the guide to take the picture otherwise the picture wont look 'real n lively'....my niece really enjoyed being here....for three people we paid won30000 .although it's quite difficult to find but the help from the tourist guide, we finally found it. we spent nearly 2 hours there....."
248,5.0,This is really great value for money. There are various different 3D looking paintings on the wall and you stand by them and have your photos taken and it looks like you are part of the picture.It was really busy when we went and the locals didn't seem to understand queueing they tended to push past you and take their photos. So I suggest either go first thing in the morning when its not as busy or don't stand back waiting to take your photo.There was also an ice gallery here as well which was small but fun to look around and a great way to cool off.We paid ¬£7 for the two attractions.
249,5.0,"Funny pictures can be token, worth spending a morning there. But the location is difficult to be found, should give clear directions from the metro station."
250,4.0,"Never expected such a attraction where it uses perspective to create loads of fun. Remember to bring your camera as you put on your creativity hat and have loads of fun posing for pictures. We visited on a weekend and therefore its filled with locals and tourist. Therefore i recommend to go during the weekdays so that you have more space to take photos. Also the ticket comes with the Ice Museum ticket and you get to go inside a negative 4 ice container/fridge with a lot of beautiful ice sculptures. There's even a ice house with living area, bedroom and kitchen, all made of ice! There is also a ice slide that you can slide down! Really fun and worth the visit !"
251,4.0,Spent a about 1-2 hours there.located at a building's basement in a small road tucked away from the busy street.the pictures came out really fun and funny! may take quite a while to get a perfect shot with kids running around.good time filler if you have a short morning or afternoon to spare before you leave seoul
252,5.0,"Bring your camera! You'll take lots of pictures and have lots of fun ! We had a lot of fun taking pictures, posing and playing with the perspective art pieces. There were a lot of people as we went during the weekends so i'd recommend to go during the weekdays so that you have more space to take photos. A lot of people were crowded in an area and we had to excuse ourselves to take photos. Also the ticket comes with the Ice Museum ticket and you get to go inside a negative 4 ice container/fridge with a lot of beautiful ice sculptures. There is also a ice slide that you can slide down ! Really fun and worth the visit !"
253,5.0,"Well you need just 2 hours at maximum but you will thank me. It is nt one of those big lofty museums. It s just a small exhibition kind of thing that gives a lovely little amusing experience, so donot miss it"
254,5.0,"Lots of fun and interesting moments going through all the tricky path from start to finish. Enjoyable, fun and tricky experience in Trickeye Museum, Seoul, South Korea  2013"
255,5.0,"We've read about the Trick Eye museum in Hongdae while looking for some cool places to visit in Seoul. Good thing we are also staying in Mapo-gu where the crowd is mostly students. The museum is also near the Hongcup chicken which is a must-try. Prepare to spend more than an hour striking poses and taking pictures with the cool and tricky portraits and rooms. I like the one with all those confusing mirrors in it! So, make sure you have your camera ready with adequate memory space! :)"
256,4.0,"This place was really hard to find!! I got lost and asked some people, no one had any idea. So take good directions! To get there, take the subway to Hongik University (Line 2, Exit 9). Walk straight then turn left at the first intersection. Walk until you reach Starbucks on the left. Cross the main street on your right and go down the alley next to Holika Holika. It takes about 10 minutes to get there.This place is really fun (if a bit expensive 13000 won), it takes an hour or so to see everything. And make sure you go in a pair at least so you can take heaps of photos, or ask the staff, they are happy to help with poses and photo taking!"
257,4.0,The art comes to life.  it's a great little museum to take elementary school aged kids.  Is small but fun enough to keep you entertained for about an hour to hour.
258,4.0,It's a nice place to enjoy with family members. Quite difficult to locate as it is located within the basement of a complex. You need to be a kid again to enjoy this place. If you are too serious then you will not be able to act and have fun with the trick eye photos. have fun and lots of laugh...
259,2.0,Funny but overcrowded and tiny. 13000 won for a 20 min is a shame. I would like to tell you more about this museum but...there is nothing else to add.
