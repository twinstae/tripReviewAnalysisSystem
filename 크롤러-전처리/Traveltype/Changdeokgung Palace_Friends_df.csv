0,5.0,"Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty.  It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding.A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof.  There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views.The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace;the Changgyeonggung Palace;the Deoksugung Palace; andthe Jongmyo Shrine."
1,4.0,"It is not original building,  it was destroyed and rebuilt. Actually,  it is not one but series of buildings. I recommend going there with a guide."
2,5.0,"very good place to visit and learn history. I have been there twice, second time is for the  secret gardon, different season has different view in this gardon, it's worth go there many times."
3,5.0,"Historically palace, if you wearing hanbok , you get to enter for free because Koreans care much about their traditions. Very impressed."
4,5.0,"The palace covers a large area. So be prepared to walk in comfy footwear. There are many sections of the palace to explore and a conservatory / green house and a lake. Need at least a day to cover most grounds which we ran out of time as we were busy taking photos at every turn (almost!).There is a map of the palace located in various section so you know where you are going. In total about 15 sections. The autumn scape is of vibrant and fiery red as the maple trees / leaves change for the season. Very colourful and scenic. Worth a visit. You can also hire the traditional attire - Hanbok from nearby shop. We bought rented our Hanbok via an app for 4-hour and it only cost us US$15 each, and also get free admission in to the palace. If you are in Seoul for a few days try this experience!"
5,4.0,This tour includes a guided tour of the palace grounds at night plus a performance at the end if the tour. We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap. It would have been nice if we were given some traditional Korean sweets instead of the soap. Try the moonlight tour if you want a different experience but do note the price is much higher than the day ticket.
6,4.0,Secret garden for the Palace is totally recommended for a visit during Autumn. The scenery is captivating.
7,4.0,"A beautiful palace, ine of the nicest in Seoul. There are many events and weddings going on on premise with traditional clothing."
8,5.0,I hired the traditional “hanbok” dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos. This place is perfect for photos and the architecture and history is beautiful. Wearing the traditional dress made it more surreal and it really felt like you were there. It is a huge place so bring water and get as much photos as you can.
9,4.0,"Sure this is a beautiful place you need to visit when in Seoul.Nice palace a garden normally plenty of tourist, but quite large to breath."
10,5.0,"Great palace. Even better if you rent a hanbok from the shop opposite the entrance for around W15,000 - free entry into the palace if you’re wearing traditional korean dress (doesn’t apply for the secret garden)"
11,5.0,Lovely place filled with history. There is so much to see. We did t have time to do the secret gardens. It was a very good visit.
12,5.0,It is like a mirror that shows us how this developed world emerged from its unique history. Soldiers make a morning show for visitors.
13,4.0,The Gyeongbokgung Palace was packed and a very long queue of people so taking a TripAdvisor's suggestion we came here. Beautiful buildings and a calm atmospher so happy with my choice.
14,5.0,"If you rent the typical Korean clothes, you can enter the palace for free. Otherwise you need to pay for a ticket. There are many stores that offer the Korean clothes for rent. The gardens and the palace itself is a half day visit that is really impressive."
15,5.0,"I visited this palace as part of a Seoul City Tour company tour.  It was very helpful to have a tour guide explain this palace to us. This palace was used for mainly residential purposes.  The palace is huge with many buildings as well as a garden.  It also is on the Lonely Planet's Ultimate Travel List, and it has a Traveler's Choice award. I was surprised that this site was not very busy.  This is an important part of Korean's history and culture."
16,5.0,This palace is small than Gyengbokgung but very beautiful with traditional architecture. There is a way links to the Deoksugung which have a lake and very unique glass house. It might take 2 hours to visit this place.
17,4.0,"The structures tell stories and the value of the people residing in them. Although there are some sad stories behind the Palace, still it is amazing to know that Koreans preserve their heritage.Read the landmarks placed in every area  so that you'll appreciate more of the structures, the rooms, the gates.The secret garden is a different ticket but it is the most relaxing part of the tour.. You can sense the peaceful vibe of the nature and the calm effect of the ponds near the study area.. There are stories behind every location and it is good to know them also.. You'll learn about Joseon dynasty and how princes and kings walked down the relaxing lane of greenery, and partly of their beliefs and traditions during the tour if you listen well to your guide. English guides have time slots so make sure you know the schedule and be there on time.Old doesn't mean dull, but it is rich in history, and beauty.. If given the chance, I would still go back here.. (on another season.. =)"
18,5.0,It's a wonderful place to add in your Itinerary to have a glimpse of  Korea's rich history.  Enjoyed walking thru their courtyard and the huge structures that they have in the grounds.
19,5.0,Must see part of any visit to Seoul..in fact the main attraction. Many Asian and Korean visitors hire traditional dress for the visit which adds to the spectacle. There is a guard changing ceremony you can view at around 10.30A.M so time your visit...lasts around 15 minutes. Leave max two hours for a good tour around and as always best to visit with a guide to get the most of the history. Very modern and clean restrooms on site as well as a decent cafe. Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop.
20,5.0,Visited this place while wearing Hanbok and hence got a free entrance. It is smaller than the Gyeongbukgung palace but it is also very well kept and maintained. One of the highlights of this palace would be the secret garden tour which is highly recommended! Do remember to book/reserve the tickets online prior to visiting the palace to avoid disappointment as it can get very popular. Would advise going earlier in the day to avoid the sun and people to get good photos :)Tour was fun and we saw the harvesting festival with Koreans dressed in the traditional costumes celebrating the harvesting season. Definitely worth going!
21,5.0,"We were glad that we were able to join the guided tour in English of the Secret Garden at the back portion of this palace and to learn more about Korean History and life of royals, and how the palace was used. It is nice that Korea was able to preserve this for people to visit and appreciate."
22,4.0,"Palace is just nice and interesting, but the walk in the secret garden is value added to it. In reality, you can enter only with a guided tour but you can after first longer stop take your own route!"
23,4.0,not too bigyou can spend a time for 1-2 hour to walk aroundthere is a garden that you have to go with tour guidein autumn it may very beatiful
24,4.0,"It was not so crowded as I went on weekday. Too bad the main entrance ticket didn't include entry to the secret garden, so didn't go in."
25,5.0,It's the secondary palace used during the Joseon Dynasty and the Secret Garden is a must to visit as it's open at limit time for visitors only.It's worth to visit and understand the information provided by the guide. It's a good time to explore during Spring from my view as the weather is great walking around the palace as I have great interest in the history of Korea.
26,3.0,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result. If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it."
27,5.0,We visited this this palace on a rainy day but this didn’t take anyway any of the beauty only some of the crowds! A big palace with some beautiful buildings to explore. Our highlight was the Secret Garden tour. We reserved this early as we heard it gets booked up fast! The tour is 90 minutes but so worth it. The gardens are so peaceful and well preserved and our English tour guide gave a thorough history and 5-10 minutes at each stop to wander and take our own pictures. We would definitely recommdend a visit!
28,4.0,"If you only have time for ONE palace, choose this one. It is more expansive -- has more trees and more structures. Better to book the secret garden tour ahead (esp. if you prefer the English tour) so that you plan your visit accordingly."
29,5.0,One of the most fascinating and well preserved royal residential palace from the Joseon Dynasty. Another UNESCO World Heritage site in Seoul.
30,5.0,"I visit during peak autumn and bought a secret garden entrance ticket..to my expectation, its was worth the money! the scenery was extremely stunning! you can see the leaves from green, yellow, red and dark red scattered around the palace and the architecture is also gorgeous!"
31,5.0,The history of this place is incredible.  It is massive and we had a wonderful English language tour that gave us some extensive information on how the royals lived over the centuries.  It is hard to believe that the palace was occupied until only 30 years ago.  The palace is well worth a visit and I encourage anyone visiting to take the time to join a tour to really learn how the Joseon lived.The grounds were glorious in the autumn.
32,4.0,"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough. Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul. Enjoy."
33,5.0,"Wonderful palace with much to see and do, and with a multitude of photo opportunities. Beautifully kept grounds."
34,4.0,A group of eight from young old to elderly having fun in admiring the spacious and tranquil palace. As we didn't have enough time  so we missed the famous Secret Garden. However we love the architectural structure and the special atmosphere.
35,5.0,It snowed the day we went and it went on quite heavily the whole morning. Secret Garden of Changdeokgung was completely covered in snow. It was a beautiful sight though VERY COLD. Our tour guide was wonderful and patient in explaining the gardens and architecture. Completely worth the visit. Especially the snowy landscapes!
36,5.0,This historic Palace is a must see. You feel like you are being transported back in time. The changing of the guard ceremony is not to be missed!
37,5.0,Spend the few extra dollars to get the secret garden tour.  Our guide Kim was awesome; she was funny and complimented our Korean.
38,5.0,"I like this much better than Gyeongbokgung, especially because of the Secret Garden tour. And I think it's just the right size to walk around and appreciate each structure."
39,3.0,"This is a good place for a walk on the beautiful grounds. Fall time made for nice colors in photos. the buildings are nice, but the real interesting part is the changing of the guard on the top of the hour. it's free and nice to see."
40,4.0,Beautiful and stunning palace with the autumn leaves! Go with tour guide to the Huwon and learn about the history of the palace. Nice place for a stroll!
41,5.0,"It was created in mid 1300. The secret garden was a place intended to allow royal family members to relax. The venue was used for a wide variety-of entreatment activities, including-archery contests. Te secret garden is about 69% of the entire venue. Beautiful place home of a 350 year old tree...it is place to visit more than once not inly because it will enrich your soul but because the nature is full of wonderful details difficult to capture all at once."
42,5.0,"Since most of the palaces are very similar, this is the one to pick because of its secret garden. You need timed tickets to get in to the secret garden and its mandatory to have a palace tour guide for the garden. It's actually a summer retreat mini village, and there are many charming buildings to explore in the secret garden. The palace buildings are beautiful, always remember to look up at the elaborate painting on the ceilings. You don't need a guide for the palace proper. The raised walkway going in was reserved for the king, while the lower left paved part of the walkway was for the military only, and the lower right paved part of the walkway was for the court ladies only, who numbered about one thousand. We did hire a guide for the day who also took us to Joygesa Buddhist Temple, and we were glad we did. The big aged brass buckets that are near buildings were actually fire extinguishers of the day. They were full of water at all times, holding about 20 gallons. You will be warned endlessly that the secret garden is very physically challenging which I would disagree with. There are hills, but the climb is gradual. I have bad knees and had no trouble with it. This was the second of the palaces built in Seoul, which happened every time the shaman felt bad luck was on the way, so they would build a new palace to escape misfortune. Very beautiful place, and definitely the one to pick if you only have the time or inclination to visit one palace."
43,5.0,"We came here as a recommendation from a local. The Secret Back Garden is a must visit, additional entrance fee. The fall foliage makes the garden so picturesque. Worth a morning visit."
44,5.0,I paid 8k won for both the palace entrance and secret garden entrance which comes with guided tour. The garden is a UNESCO heritage sight. Definitely worth a visit... remember to wear comfortable shoes as some parts required going up slopes
45,5.0,"though smaller than its main sister, the Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace can hold its own. In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot."
46,5.0,Couldn’t get over the colours in the palace Secret Garden! October is clearly the month to visit with stunning foliage everywhere. You can also do special self guided tours at the moment so you can explore at your own pace. My favourite palace that we visited!
47,5.0,You should visit all the palace. all are special in there own way. Gyeongbokgung is ofcourse the bigest and the one you shoud do for sure when you are in Korea
48,5.0,Stroll through Changdeokgung Palace and soak in the awesomeness of the place. We wore authentic Korean dresses while strolling through the grounds.
49,5.0,"I love this place. I learned a lot about their culture. In fact, the scenery inside there is so great."
50,5.0,"It was truly beautiful. For free entry to the palace, rent a hanbok (₩10,000 for 2 hours, ₩20,000 for 4 hours, ₩30,000 for the whole day and an extra ₩5,000 for accesories). The secret garden is a wondrous place. A bit of a walk, but not too difficult (had one guy on crutches in the walking tour). ₩5,000 entry into the secret garden if wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean dress) or ₩10,000 normally. All in all, a splendid venture into the history of South Korea."
51,4.0,"We had a nice guided tour with a good English speaking guide, very interesting history and amazing blue ceramic tile roofing"
52,4.0,The temple is a beautiful place to see in Seoul. Make sure to visit the secret garden. Make a réservation before you go
53,5.0,"Great,Second visit were more interesting.If you want to know more about Korean history you shuld visit"
54,4.0,"I would recommend the secret garden tour, but there’s steep hills and stairs so don’t take the elderly here! Don’t expect lots of flowers but more serene forested areas with native trees which are also nice"
55,5.0,"You need to visit this place and walk around for at least half a day to fully appreciate the grandeur of Korea’s royalty and rich history. Make sure you visit the Secret Garden but plan the timing as you need to join a guided tour. It’s 10,000 Won for the full package and it’s worth it."
56,4.0,I really enjoyed Changdeokgung - it didn't feel as crowded as Gyeongbokgung and the Secret Garden Tour was such a treat! Definitely worth going into if you want a more relaxed atmosphere of exploring how the emperors and empresses lived!
57,5.0,After visiting Changdeokgung Palace have a stroll inside Biwon the forbidden garden in the park (check the time as only guided tour are allowed)
58,5.0,It was nice to see the palace closely and see the area of the king and the queen and how they were separated for work purposes Our tour guide helped in explains a lot of things around Nice place to visit ManalOman
59,5.0,"Definitely book the private guided tour (if English, they only run on certain days at certain times so go there early enough to secure a spot on the tour).  This is the only way to see the secret garden!  Tour guides are excellent."
60,4.0,"Not to big, but a nice park for a morning walk to see traditional Korean architecture and to learn some history. Less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace and it is great with combination to visit the Bukchon area.If you rent a Hanbok, you get the entrance for free. Be prepared to meet a lot of girls in traditional clothes, especially in the weekendsYou have to pay extra to visit the Secret garden."
61,3.0,"Entrance to the Changdeokgung Palace costed 3000 wons, but the Secret Garden could only be admitted by joining a 5,000 won tour at the entrance.  Tourists are only allowed to tour the garden with the Guide. We visited in July and joined a Chinese tour at 12:30pm.  The Garden is not big and with just a few buildings/attractions inside, many of which did not allow entry.  The tour can be completed within 30 minutes.  However, the guide prolonged the tour to more than one hour.  It was very hot on a summer day with lots of mosiquitos, and no fun to stand in front of a lily pond for 20 minutes listening to the guide chatting with tourists on topics unrelated to the palace or the garden.  In fact, relevant historical information provided was minimal.  The tour ended up being a boring torture and I would advise skipping it."
62,3.0,Worth having a look at.  Not a lot to see.  You can buy a ticket which allows you entrance to all the palaces here.  The main attraction is the secret garden.  Not really what I would call a garden but a walk through a forest with a guide which was quite interesting.
63,2.0,"My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great.The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors.The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear, so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It's not a botanic garden with flowers and plants, rather it's a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So, with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn't find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb, so not easy for elderly.I don't recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking."
64,5.0,It was really cold the day we went but it was worth it. Would like to go back in the spring season to see The Secret Garden again. A must see if you like history and seeing such a peaceful place among all those skyscrapers.
65,4.0,Must see at least one of the palaces when visiting Seoul. This one is pretty huge. Not too crowded and the audio guide was pretty informative.
66,5.0,Visited during autumn. Very memorable.. Didn't expect it to be a small palace but worth taking a stroll and looking at the beautiful autumn leaves and lake. There is a truck selling red bean cakes outside the palace.. So delicious!
67,4.0,We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session.I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior Citizen'.It's the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge.Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them.
68,4.0,"It is worth booking ahead to do the secret garden palace tour. As has been mentioned in other reviews, it’s a relatively hilly landscape so I noticed that older attendees didn’t complete all of the walk. The palace is large and pretty and the gardens lovely (it was just approaching cherry-blossom season when I visited). It was nice to get some context – the tour itself lasted around 90 minutes and the guide was very good. The tour comprised a very large group but given the vastness of the gardens, the crowd did not overwhelm.Afterwards, enjoy a cup of local tea at one of the cafes and take in the surroundings. Lots of people visit fully clad in traditional outfits, so it is worth taking a moment to people watch and appreciate the traditional vibes. (I believe there is a discount for entry / it is free if people dress-up!)"
69,4.0,"This palace boasts a forest garden where pavilions, buildings and resting spaces are all integrated with Korea's forest plants. The garden is only accessed via guided tours, which is understandable in a way, since you don't want visitors picking flowers or dabbling their feet in the pools, but it does take away some of the charm of this garden.However, even with that caveat, it is still worth visiting as a place of peace, beautiful scenes and great photo opportunities.Be prepared to walk a long way - in summer hats and water bottles are a must."
70,5.0,"I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home. Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places nearby, very reasonably priced, and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also, free entry if you do so. Whilst here we were approached by people (I want to say high school students?) who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this, but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other."
71,4.0,"Amazing palace with beautiful architecture. Entry was free with the discover Seoul Pass. We had just come from Gyeongbokgung so this place seemed smaller compared to there. The palaces looked similar on the outside but the decorations here were a bit more colourful. This place also has tours to the secret garden, the tickets are extra to the entrance ticket and located near the entrance of the garden. We had just missed the last English one for the day so decided to go to the next place instead."
72,4.0,"There are many stores around that will rent outfits to complete the adventure and take pictures in this impressive place with an appropriate attire. The Palace is just like any other palace in Asia, which is not bad but not necessarily something to look for if you've been to China and Japan."
73,5.0,We love it so much. Especially ceremony of guards must to see. This palace have a colourfull nature!
74,4.0,"This is much better to take pictures rather than the main palace. The building here has more character and not that many tourists. You have to go here early in the morning to enjoy the place without too much tourists. Btw, I'm just lucky this is walking distance to my accommodation. 😍😍😍"
75,3.0,"Take a couple photos from the outside, peer into the dark rooms but many you can't enter. Tour the garden which is just azaleas and ponds. Not much to recommend it as special"
76,5.0,i was felt in korean history dramaromantically for couple and familyi amaze with people who using hanbok even its in crowded its still good view for your eye.
77,5.0,Behind the palace lies the 78-acres garden which was originally constructed for the use of the royal family and palace women.
78,5.0,"You can wear Hambok it will be ur free tix to every palace, and make a reservation of the tour especially the Secret Garden!!不會害羞穿韓服很多宮都免費入場，CP值還不錯👍 記得上網預約秘苑導覽，非常美！宮內景色美就不用多提，四季都有各種風貌，有趣的是很多穿韓服的觀光客，讓這個古蹟增色了不少，有點衝突，但美麗。"
79,5.0,"If you ever visit Korea especially Seoul.and plan to have a sightseeing their palaces.you can buy a package for only 10,000 KRW for enter 4 different palaces and you manage to get Secret Garden ticket in changdeokgung palace.They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket.for me its pretty good deal.I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to.Changdeokgung is massive palace, but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung.But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time.and must be guided.it even got secured by 2 security personel.I got here only 2 hours before closed.So I didn't get much around the palace itself.We straight to secret garden entrace, and thank god the guide wasn't there yet.after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden.don't worry the guide was speaking english, also there is a chinese tour for certain time.the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself, other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission. so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden.the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide.Its like went inside another world, its not like seoul..when you enter you can only feel peace.the air is different, even though the city just right upon you. I just want to stay there as long as I could.But I could not because the guide only give us 10-15 minutes spare time for each site we visit.wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1-1,5 hours.and there quite few hills.my friend just went under surgeries last month and can't take the hills very well.security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour.for me if you visit seoul and have extra time.do visit this palace and secret garden for certain."
80,5.0,"This is the palace what actually most used. Not that big as Gyeongbokgung but it well organized. If you have time, I recommend to take free guided tour first and look around alone. Need extra time and payment for Huwon. It worth it!! Some people visit Changdeokgung for Huwon. Must visit!"
81,5.0,"Go for guided huwon trip if you have ample time. It's very beautiful and tranquil. However, might be challenging for small kids or elderly as it involved quite a bit of walking."
82,5.0,"Changdeokgung is the second palace of Joseon dynasty.  It was built on 1504, 10 years after the Gyeongbokgung palace.  If I choose the one building to see at Changdeokgung is Sunjeongjeon(선정전, 宣政殿), the office building of the king.  Only this building has the original blue roof tile(青瓦) which was made on 17th century."
83,5.0,"I totally fell in love with all of those Korean Palaces.Indeed, when you have a walk there, it is so relaxing, so calm. The nature there is beautiful and the palaces are so well-designed. It’s like entering a new world inside a city."
84,5.0,"This palace is a wonderful historic site with lots of see. There are plenty of smaller buildings as well as the large, central palace structures. You can rent traditional Hanbok clothing from nearby shops and wear the traditional garb into the palace for pictures. Prepare for a lot of walking!"
85,5.0,"This palace is a must see for anyone who enjoys beauty, architecture, history, nature, or a peaceful afternoon. The Secret Garden tour provides many interesting details about the buildings and surroundings. Meandering around the grounds you see people of all ages and nationalities enjoying the beauty, and photo opportunities."
86,5.0,Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden are special treasures to see when you visit Korea. We were here during the Lunar New Year so there were many people in traditional dress taking pictures and it made you feel like you had gone back in time. I think even in wintertime when the plants are not in bloom it is still nice to see the palace grounds. Put this site on the top of your list when you come to Seoul.
87,5.0,"Grand, massive, beautiful and peaceful. Well preserved. An interesting view into Korean history. Worth a visit."
88,4.0,"We all know that the winter in Korea is harsh and bitter. The temperature outside was minus 17degrees centigrade. Everything is so cold you could barely hold anything. An intense feeling of numbness permeates my hands while holding my iPhone to take pictures. The freezing cold did not stop us from visiting the Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul Korea. It is a look of a true Korean beauty. It was built in 1405 as a Palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was consisted of so many halls most of which were huge and spacious and were used for the most formal state events, coronation ceremonies and receptions of foreign envoys. A beautiful secret garden Is situated at the back of the Palace which enhanced the unique architectural structure of the pavilions and was intended as a place for relaxation of the King and his royal family. It was also used as a venue for various activities to include sports  competition most notably in archery during those days. To better appreciate the history of the Palace there is a guided tour in English for a minimal fee. There is also a small fee for admission to the secret garden and the main Palace itself."
89,4.0,Typical palace in Korea. Have similarity with others. Most visited palace. Nice place to know more about Korean culture.
90,4.0,"Aside from palaces, they also have a secret garden. They too offer variety of korean restaurant however, the vietnamese resto was perfect for a hungry stomach."
91,4.0,"For me, Changdeokgung is the prettiest palace I went to. I've seen Gyeongbukgung, Deoksugung, and Hwaseong Hanggung. The area is compact and landscape has a lot of beautiful plants. Best season to go would probably be spring and autumn. Also tried the Secret Garden tour. I takes a bit of physical activity to go through the garden. I was quite a hike. I didn't expect it so we took a longer time touring this place than what we planned."
92,5.0,"Visited this palace with two of my friends. There weren't many people when we were there.The place is interesting, although it is not as large as Gyeongbukgung, it is just as beautiful!"
93,4.0,"Nicely preserved/renovated buildings, impressive from the outside but not too much left inside. While you are free to walk around in the palace grounds, the Secret Garden can only be visited with a guided tour (5000 W, ca 80 mind, 2-3 English language tours per day). Various ponds, landscaped gardens and side buildings. Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke very good English. Recommended tour even in Winter."
94,3.0,"We paid the first 3000 Korean won for the main entrance admission. We explored a few areas, and found it a bit underwhelming because it kind of looks similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace. We then went on to the next area, the secret garden, where there was an additional fee of 8000 won to enter. I guess it will be kept a secret because we opted not to enter. We were probably ""Palaced out"" after we thoroughly explored Gyeongbokgung Palace."
95,5.0,"Many thanks to my friend Soon Nam who suggested a visit to the palace as it was in Seoul city.  Its easy to get to the Palace  either by bus  or taxi...for us tourists :-)) .. .I wanted to learn more about Korean people, their history and interaction with other Countries, how Korean culture developed and Korean loyalty and steadfastness..I  visited the Palace in mid November 2017 , it was cool with a light breeze ., Inside the grounds it was quiet and tranquil and we walked through my friend explained what the different buildings were , why they building [wing] was built, for whom and when it was built.  .We joined an English-speaking guide who guided us  through and explained why and when the smaller buildings were built and  how the buildings were heated during the cold winters. .. MANY THANKS to the guide.. she did an excellent job of explaining in detail.. her English  with an eastern-American accent was easy to understand .. At a  small hill there was a lake and stream that flowed to the lower part  and a building where the Imperial family performed annual rituals to honour the planting and harvesting of crops...i saw others were dressed in colourful  traditional Korean clothing.. later I found out that these were tourists who had rented these..After about three hours I left the park to return to modern Seoul and found a wonderful place nearby to have lunchon Weekends  more people visit the Palace. A delight to be able to have a glimpse of a long-time-ago  Korean   palace."
96,4.0,Changdeokgung should not be missed if you are in the area.  Worth to buy the palace package tour as these are next to each other
97,5.0,Spring and fall is the best season for visiting here. Especially the secret garden is a real hidden gem of seoul. Recommend booking in ad. Otherwise you will have to test ur luck! I waited 30 minutes in line and lucky to buy last tickets for 15:30  in the morning :) but it totally worth my waiting I was touched by my city. So much history in it and such a beautiful garden. It is different style from China and Japan. Focus on nature itself  no artificial no frills very natural!  It calms my mind!
98,5.0,"We visited the palace in autumn when the leaves were turning, making the Secret Garden a magical tour. The ginkos and Japanese maples were in full fall color. The buildings are beautiful and the history of the palace and grounds was fascinating."
99,5.0,A must see for all visitors. I love watching Historical Korean drama so seeing the actual palace in real life is so majestic!
100,4.0,We only went for the guided tour around the secret garden (best to book online). We bought the combined ticket at 10000 won which includes entry to all 5 palaces and the secret garden tour. We walked around part of the palace on our own. The palace looked very simple but the gardens were beautiful. There are some steep walks around the secret garden so wear comfortable shoes. The guide stopped for a few minutes at each stop to allow us to rest or take photos.
101,5.0,The most beautiful palace among the 4 main palaces in Seoul. Admission fee is 3000w (building area) and 5000w for secret garden. You have to join guided tour for the secret garden and please take note on the time.
102,5.0,"The palace is simply but the secret garden is very beautiful, good to have a walk. There are stop place for relax and reading book. Very beautiful in autumn time"
103,4.0,We took a half day tour to Changdeokgung Palace and it was an amazing experience. The guide was great and narrated the Korean history beautifully. The most enchanting experience was the garden tour... lush green garden with lakes and waterfall. Recommend every tourist to visit this place.
104,5.0,Another great palace.  It truly is a treat to see.  History in this city is amazing going back for thousands of years.  All fo the palaces are very impressive.  It is a good walk and may experience hills and uneven ground.  Make sure you have good shoes.
105,5.0,"It's a big complex area. They have museum inside the complex. And If you really want to know the story of this palace and how korean lifestyle during the era, hired a tour guide. You can also walk around this palace using Hanbok traditional korean outfit, I think they are gorgeous."
106,5.0,"If you are going to this palace, make sure you have the Integrated Pass. The Secret Garden is included with the purchase of that pass. The Secret Garden may only be accessed, however, by joining a group tour organized by palace management. Better check on the tour schedules. I didn't bother and got stuck with the Korean tour group. I have zero Korean language background aside from the usual hi, bye, and thanks. So, I couldn't really appreciate any information from the tour as it wasn't in English.  Aside from the Secret Gardens, what makes this palace unique is the collection of reconstructed imperial government offices in the grounds. It is a maze in that area. Picture-perfect opportunities also if you have your traditional Korean costume on. Now, if only it wasn't raining heavily when I was there..."
107,4.0,Came here to look at the palace late afternoon but ended on the guide tour which was quite interesting..you get to know more history of the palace plus the history of the Kings that ruled the country with its historical times.
108,4.0,It's a nice temple to go to with lots of nice views and different things to see.  It's also next to another temple and surrounded by a wooded area making it really pretty. In that same area there is also the secret garden that you can see. Nearby the shopping and not too far from gunbokgung temple as well.
109,5.0,"We went there last November. Despite the cold, the palace is a must if you have not been to Korean palaces. The Royal garden is also interesting with ponds, pavilion and good landscapeing. I made advance reservations for entrance with English  guided tour online. There is a special web site for booking. The guide was informative and friendly. I plan to make another visit there in Spring to see the flowers."
110,5.0,"This palace is less crowded than some, is well restored and interesting. But the big attraction is the Secret Garden, which is hardly secret but is a gem. Very hard to remember you are in the heart of downtown Seoul when inside. Don't miss it!"
111,4.0,"A lot of old architecture to see if you appreciate the history, every pillar on roof comes with a FORK alike item that is to prevent bird from nesting around, such a intelligent design since old korea age"
112,5.0,"We had a beautiful morning for our visit to Changdeokgung Palace, all the better to take it in at an unhurried pace. Changdeokgung was originally built as a secondary to the main, Gyeongbokgung Palace, which I have toured on several previous occasions.The main difference about Changdeokgung Palace is that it was built with the full intention of integrating it into its natural surroundings. So while the buildings may appear strange, they are intended to harmonize with the topography according to ""pungsu principles"". The palace structures are all situated to the south, with the immense ""Secret Garden"" at the rear and to the north.Although the original buildings of Changdeokgung were destroyed by fire, the reconstruction are said to retain a high degree of authenticity. Anyway you look at it, it's immense and gorgeous! You do have to hit the timing right to visit the Secret Garden (w/ purchase of a separate ticket), as tour groups go at different times, in different languages.A charming new tradition we noticed is that many shops nearby the palace offer Hanbok (traditional dress) rental. Many groups of beautiful, young (mostly Japanese, it seemed) women were everywhere in Hanbok & pretty, flower-laced, hair-do's, happily taking selfies. We thought them all quite adorable & a nice addition to the feeling of stepping back into a page in history!"
113,5.0,"The palaces was very ornate in detail. Free tour guide provided was very knowledgeable and has excellent command in English. It is definitely better than the more touristy Gyeongbokgung Palace, especially considering its status as World Heritage Site (while Gyeongbokgung is not).If you have time, you can opt for Secret Garden Tour with an additional cost. I did not do but I heard the secret garden was the ""must-see"" part of Changdeokgung Palace."
114,5.0,"Do not leave Seoul without visiting this Palace that is absolutely the best!Huge inside l, it was the ancient traditional residence of the king.If you are lucky (I was there at around 2pm) to find the change if the guard don't miss the show! The best one ever seen with traditional band and guards dressed up with the traditional clothes. Around the Palace are roaming young girls and boys wearing typical costumes, they are very friendly and you can take pics with them.There is also a nice bar inside serving traditional food and teas.Visit the museum also it's included in the ticket price."
115,5.0,"I find this place to be more authentic than the one in Gyeongbukgung. Although the architecture is quite the same, the arrangement of the palace which follows the contour of the land makes it unique. The secret garden although limited from time to time is also recommended!"
116,4.0,"Another jewel in Korea's crown of superb historical sites. We took our time to enjoy it all and spent enough time in each section. Magnificent collections of Korean antiquities, art and historical pieces. Such beauty! We were lucky that it was Korean special holiday, and all the locals were visiting dressed in their traditional national outfits. We really got a great opportunity to enjoy and be immersed in Korean culture. I was so happy to have had the opportunity to photograph a group of beautiful and giggly teenage girls dressed in their beautiful national costumes. See photo below. Just lovely!"
117,5.0,"Good and fun to have a historic tour now and then. There are different themes at certain times of the year. I missed the night tours, so will definitely be back!"
118,5.0,This palace represents the korean people they reallt preserves their culture and tradition even up to this days. Nice palace and very clean probably you may have pictorial of your Prenup.
119,5.0,"I recommend ""one day hanbok"" as the place to get your hanbok for both men and women. Wearing hanboks makes all palaces free for you! This palace overall was a good experience and make argue to buy a secret garden pass to see more beautiful scenery"
120,5.0,"We were here in October when the leaves were just starting to change. We went along with our Korean friend and his girlfriend, and joined the tour (which he said was mandatory), but we got sidetracked taking photos and sort of wandered off from the group (which didn't seem to be a problem). Our friend showed us around the rest of the area and still knew enough to tell us a bit about the palace, so it was all good. We spent awhile walking around the grounds taking pictures and had a nice afternoon here. It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you like visiting palaces and enjoy architecture."
121,5.0,This place is a feast to the eyes even on a summer day with all the lush greens surrounding the palace. Too bad we were in a hurry that we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden. Oh well..
122,5.0,We went here because we bought the package tickets for all the palaces. I would say that it's worth seeing once.
123,5.0,"Great palace to visit, just one subway stop away from Gyeongbokgung, admission is also free if you are wearing Hanbok. Secret Garden is definitely a must see. We went there in June, but the most beautiful views can be seen in Fall."
124,3.0,"Unimpressive palace that looks like a newly built movie set. The gardens are also boring and lacked imagination. Have seen much  better and memorable historical sites at other Asian countries than this. e.g. Japan. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this."
125,5.0,"I really enjoyed the Secret Garden Tour even if I was not physically prepared for it. My friends and I didn't know that it will be a hike and the guide was too fast that we can't keep up. But regardless, we still enjoyed it. I liked it because it was a different experience from the usual palace tours I've joined before."
126,5.0,"Well worth a visit, gorgeous palace and grounds plus gardens. Not sure if we hit a special occasion but lots of young Koreans dressed in traditional costume made the visit so authentic. Don't miss it"
127,5.0,"Entrance fee is only 3,000 Won making it super cheap. You also have the option of having a guided tour, not sure what the costs are. The palace is beautiful especially if you've never seen something similar. Within the palace grounds you also have the option of seeing the secret garden, however, this has to be guided and costs 5,000 Won, takes about an hour. Its not really a garden, more a forest that has hidden spots within it. Beautiful and worth the time."
128,5.0,"We love 昌德宮，every  where like check point for take photo. Here, We dressed Hando and take beautiful pictures."
129,5.0,"I had a literal 24 hours in Seoul on a stopover and I was able to tour this beautiful palace with a local friend. The English tour was very informative and I learnt so much about what life would have been like at the palace throughout the ages! The architecture is gorgeous and the interior paintwork is like a mosaic of colour. I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent. They had a useful luggage storage locker facility, which was good as I was hauling at lot of gear.I fully recommend visiting the palace if you are staying in Seoul, whether for a ridiculously short time like I was or for a longer time."
130,4.0,"This place is a good example if you want to see Korea in the past. You will  see the design of their houses and gardens. Prepare yourself to walk around the hilly landscape. But, if you feel like to shed some pounds, enjoy walking."
131,4.0,Good example of Korean traditional architecture. Don't miss the thron hall and the hidden garden and walking aroundn
132,4.0,"This is a nice place, enjoyed going there, but could also have missed it.  But I guess you should always visit one Palace when you are in Seoul."
133,5.0,Changdeokgung Palace is so beautiful. Very peaceful and a wonderful place to explore; the grounds are very pretty. This is definitely a must visit when in Seoul.
134,5.0,"What I really liked about this palace was its gardens and the famous ""secret garden"" consider that you can only access that one with a guided tour booked on-site. Beautiful place under the cherry blossoms."
135,4.0,"I'm sure that it would be awesome when there is a festival or something going on. Even though it was just a walk and look at the architecture, it was a pleasant walk through this massive state. The palace hall was beautifully kept and the buildings go on and on. Very inexpensive at 1500 won. (US $1.40)"
136,5.0,"There is much history here on these grounds!  Changing of the guard was amazing and very colorful!  The Korean Folk museum was very interesting to spend a few hours out of the hot sun!  Beautiful gardens, ponds, and well manicured trees and shrubs!  Fantastic background for professional looking photos!"
137,5.0,"Visited changdeokgung because we wanted to see the secret garden. Missed this in winter so we're back in spring and wow, it does require advance booking if you wanna see the secret garden.. slots get booked very quickly.The tour was informative and led by a professional guide. The secret garden was beautiful! It was raining but that didn't hinder us. Recommended :)"
138,5.0,"My friends and I decided to have a hanbok experience. We rented our hanbok from one of the rental shop nearby the palace. Our rental was only for 2 hours, so we decided to hurriedly explore the palace. When wearing hanbok, the entrance fee to the palace is FREE! It's better to come early to the palace ground to beat the crowd!I didn't get time to enter the famous secret garden, but i believe it's beautiful. The palace ground itself is really beautiful. Showing the grand and elegance of the Jeoson dynasty. Some of the king's collections can be seen. Also, we can see interesting side of an actual weatern bed that the king used at the end of the japanese occupation in Korea."
139,4.0,"We missed the English tour and you can only tour the secret gardens as part of one of the palace's official tours, but we had a great private tour guide who sweet talked them into letting us join the Korean language tour. We would have had a great time enjoying the sites with a regular guide but our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the site (she used to work there) and the colour and history she added really makes all the difference in understanding the structure, the design and history including impacts of the Japanese occupation - don't cut your experience short, a good tour guide really makes all the difference."
140,5.0,We actually stumbled on this palace by accident I wanted to go to the main palace but this closes on Tuesdays so said we would go to this as we were on our last day- the secret garden is a must- try reserve a tour online before you go (day before) as we were not able to do the tour but luckily got tickets to wander about ourselves. Stunning.
141,5.0,"Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul.  While Gyeongbukgung is more famous, it has been altered more.  I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit, there are usually 2 or more a day.  The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings, but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens, ponds, and summer retreat palace buildings.  Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens.  If you only have a couple days in Seoul, I put this high on the list of places to go.  It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung, Insadong, City Hall, Myeongdong, and Namdaenum."
142,3.0,"went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March, the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour, as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour, very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session, so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed. Tour guide recommend to visit during full blown spring, authumn and winter (with snow covering the land) to enjoy the place true beauty. perhaps 1 day will revisit again."
143,5.0,This palace is simply breath-taking. Take a scroll at Huwon & enjoy the beauty. Required lots of walking & stairs thus need some stamina. Must do booking online if you want to go to Huwon.
144,5.0,It is beatifull-especially when all other palaces are closed like Tuesday.and this one is open.they are coming a lot of people in Hanbok and you can enjoy beatifull scenery of UNESCO site!
145,4.0,It's another palace that is located in Seoul city center. Lots of Cherry trees and this facts makes the best time to visit stout April when the cheery blossom is at its peak.
146,5.0,You can go any season but each season I think evokes a different ambiance to the place. It's a very relaxing place.Go for the guided tour. It will greatly help.
147,5.0,"This was the second palace I wisted, the design and style is so Intricate, wonderful place to wander around and feel the essence of korean history."
148,4.0,"This lacks the grandeur of Gyeongbukgung but I liked the serene feel of this palace, especially if you go for the Suwon. The area open to public is quite small, as majority of the land is within the secret garden tour. Actually, you can't explore the whole place even with the secret garden tour but it was worth the extra pay."
149,5.0,"Very relaxing, interesting place most especially if youre familiar with korean series ( traditional korean series theme). The secret garden part was mesmerizing. You could only imagine what was life before aged in Seoul. How they managed to restore those Korean architecture."
150,4.0,"The palace is rather grand to walk around, with many halls scattered around the large compound. Initially it was quite interesting, but after a while, the subsequent halls look quite the same. Still a great visit to explore the history of South Korea."
151,3.0,"I went in March and in the fall. I preferred it much more in the fall with the colorful leaves. This time around, it was deserted and quite sad looking. I also went to the Secret Garden and did not enjoy it during March. Go there in the spring, summer or fall. Don't waste your time and money in the pre-spring season."
152,5.0,"The pity thing is that we came there on a cold rainy day. Anyway, we still really enjoy the beautiful peaceful scenery of Changdeokgung Palace. This place is huge, make sure to follow the guides, otherwises we will get lost.We were there in April, so there're cherry blossoms blossoming. There're many other beautiful flowers in the palace too. Great place to enjoy peace, nature and take photos."
153,5.0,"Overall it was a great experience. Take a lot of photos!! If you're wondering whether or not you should pay the extra buck for Secret Garden, do not hesitate- do it. I visited in the winter and Secret Garden was the highlight of my day. Enjoy beautiful views and architecture while you listen to the tour guide's explanation of why each section of the palace existed :) but it does involve a lot of walking and climbing up some stairs, especially during the winter it could be a little harder for older visitors. We spent more time there than originally planned."
154,5.0,"I chose to go to only this Palace since it's on the UNESCO heritage site list and it also boasts a very beautiful Secret Garden. On the day that I was there, it rained before and as I was leaving the Palace. It's a very beautiful place to go even if just for the garden. I liked that while there were many people there, it wasn't crowded. I bought a ticket for the Secret Garden so there would be a guided tour. The guide wasn't very proficient in English so it was difficult to grasp what he was trying to say. It is easy enough to enjoy the Garden without a guide anyway."
155,4.0,This is a historically significant and beautiful palace to visit during a trip to Seoul. We saw this palace along with others on a tour for people associated with the American military and their families. It is beautiful in the fall and offers many great photo opportunities.
156,5.0,"The palace has a garden inside that is so beautiful. It is only available to ticket holders who are in a group tour. It is possible to reserve tickets in adavance for the garden tour, and I highly suggest doing so since it will likely sell out. I think they offer tours in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. I've only been on the English tour, and the guides were so helpful and provided unique and interesting facts both times I've gone. I really can't stress enough how lovely this place is. The garden tour is a bit of a walk though, and it does go up and down hills and stairs quite a bit. Just be aware that you'll walk a bit on the tour, but it's worth it."
157,5.0,"I went there on a very cold day -7c with my friends, the palace is full of stories for visitors to relive again, our Tour guid Ms. Kim was very nice and very smart, she made sure that all of us are enjoying the tour."
158,4.0,"We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit, but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been, but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment."
159,4.0,We had a great time exploring the palace grounds with a tour guide who gave us the detailed history. The Changing of the Guard ceremony was interesting to watch - a colorful spectacle of traditional drums and march set in the main courtyard. Definitely a site to see if you visit Seoul!
160,4.0,"Tourists from around the world at the ceremony changes imperial guard. Changing the Guard, accompanied by drums and parade in traditional costumes with military equipment and flags. After the ceremony, walk along the complex imperial palace."
161,4.0,"It was my first time to visit Seoul and apart from the Food Tour, I haven't been to any historical places. This was located by a main road in the city so it was easy to access. The place is not crowded, very spacious inside and will provide you with a lot of understanding about the Buddhist way of life. This good be done through a tour guide who can  provide valuable insights as you visit one site to another."
162,5.0,"I have been to Changdeokgung for many times. It is the best place for maples.If you want to enjoy autumn blaze maple, you definitely cannot miss the secret garden. Please make online reservation in advance."
163,4.0,We also join The Secret Garden tour with english speaking guide. Really worth it cause the garden are beautiful and serene. I think may be  during autumn this palace will be more beautiful.
164,4.0,"Although this palace is smaller than gyeongbokgung, but it is well preserved and lesser tourist here. The structure and design of the palace are pretty similar as Gyeongbokgung. I would prefer this palace than Gyeongbokgung."
165,5.0,"Fell in love with this Palace, specially with its Secret Garden.The admission fee is 3000 KRW and 5000 KRW for entering Secret Garden.I went there 2 times because on my first visit I didn't get the ticket for Secret Garden. And worth to come back ❤Please use comfortable shoes."
166,4.0,"If you are traveling alone or you need places that are private, you can go here as you can enjoy the views of Korean palace by yourself. This place is less crowded so it will be easy for you to get into the history of Changdeokgung easily. Wearing hanbok is also free here and you can get some relax."
167,5.0,"If you have time for only one palace in Seoul, go here and do the garden visit (guided tour only and quite long). The palace itself is nice, same architectural design as many palaces and temples in Korea. The gardens have a great serene atmosphere and allow you to see really nice parts of the palace complex."
168,4.0,"It's good place but not great . Very peace and all almost inside is similar everywhere . If u want to know about Korea , you may visit."
169,3.0,Autumn trees were beautiful. There is a secret garden tour which requires a little bit of walking. The tour group seems a little too big as well
170,5.0,"Tip: You can book the secret garden tour a week in advance (I suggest you do so as it's limited to 100 per slot). The English tour starts at 11.30am. Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10,000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces (including Gyeongbokgung) and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine."
171,4.0,This palace is one of the most famous a-must visit place in Korea. It's still beautiful even it was burnt during Japanese invasion. Its history has remained faithful. You should have come visit this place.
172,4.0,This palace is amazing and it was very easy and felt safe to access even with the recent protests nearby.  It is huge so bring your walking shoes. Check the daily activities schedule so you can catch the guard show.
173,3.0,"Lots of walking and steps so not for elderly, mobility impaired or small children. The gardens were to be ""beautiful"" but we went in November and there was just dirt and barren trees. Overall, not that interesting..."
174,5.0,We had a lovely afternoon out here while visiting Seoul and the entrance fee is very reasonable. We bought another ticket inside the grounds to visit the gardens. Well worth a visit while in Seoul and we were there on a Thursday which is not as busy a the weekend
175,5.0,"I enjoyed this Palace very much, it was a sprawling beautiful location. We missed the cut off for going into the garden, but I will just have to go again. It's very affordable, especially if you get the special discount for the multiple locations!"
176,5.0,"A must visit with beautiful architecture, walking paths and informative tours. Do book ahead for the Secret Garden Tour -- wear good walking shoes! Love the Fall foliage at this time of year, not sure how the garden looks during other seasons though. One UNESCO heritage site ticked!"
177,3.0,"Beautiful nature, very relaxing walking, good place to think, to write, to admire the nature, to take pictures, and be in contact with yourself."
178,5.0,"Impressive! Whole palace complex is big enough for at least 1,5 hour of walking around it. For me - it looks amazing. Just like from old kung-foo movies but it's real. There is plenty of tourist information in front of every pagoda so you can really learn a lot about the place.You can have a cup of traditional tea inside and I strongly recommend to have one."
179,4.0,Basically this palace has been reconstructed from the ground up which signify the importance of history of this place to South Koreans. There are many volunteer tour guides to guide you the significance of each building.
180,5.0,"It's a great place and it's well preserved. It remains intact and is situated in front of the Blue House, and behind the statue of King Sejong. If you want to know more about South Korea's history, this is the way to go.It only took us a 3-5 min. Walk from our guesthouse, (Guesthouse Korea). There was a performance for like every 20 mins or so? Where performers dress up as the way that people dressed before and did the rituals etc. To depict the old times. At the end of the ceremony, some performers stand outside the palace and station there where you can take a picture with them (Proper manners and gestures should be observed. They'll feel violated if you get touchy with them.)Inside, I can say that the overall palace is well-maintained. The comfort rooms are also great. Once you get out, you will see the front of the Blue House, you can also take a stroll in the side walks to enjoy the streets of Korea while enjoying the views of the falling leaves of the tree's"
181,5.0,"According to UNESCO, this biwon or secret garden situated within changdeokgung is a treasure because the landscaping is a natural occurrence. The park is built to preserve the natural landscaping in this enclosed area. According to the tour guide, the palace is a smaller place built strategically for emergency purposes. In case of plague, war, fire or any disaster, Changdeokgung is a backup."
182,4.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is a very nice place for a taste of Korean history. If you love to wear a Hanbok, this place is also a must visit to take nice photos with you wearing the traditional attire of Koreans. It's kinda hot so going in the afternoon is highly suggested. =)"
183,4.0,This palace is designated as a world heritage cultural site for good reason. Take the tour to find out how it became designated as such and for added pleasure go to the Secret Garden.
184,5.0,"This is such a beautiful palace, and it's secret garden is just extraordinary. Take the guided garden tour which transports you back to the time of the king and his family. You could imagine the royal family strolling in this wonderful garden. The fall colors just started during my visit. Can imagine it's exquisiteness in full fall colors. This is also the only palace where they let you sit inside some of the palace building and enjoy the serenity of its surroundings."
185,5.0,"This palace is nothing short of amazing, great phototaking views all around. It's an approximate 2.0km walk from the Gyeongbokgong Palace so you can choose to do palace-hopping if you're in the mood (don't go on Tuesdays though as Gyeongbokgong is closed). Furthermore, if you're in a Hanbok, admission is free!"
186,5.0,"This palace is the larger of the two in central Seoul. It has enough ground to take up a few hours walking around. The secret garden area is also a great visit and worth the extra money. It is incredibly cheap to visit the palaces in Seoul, so seeing at least one is a good idea."
187,4.0,"Well preserved and the main draw is the beautiful 'secret garden' where the Royal family members go to to relax and entertain. The ponds, pavilions and trees come out beautifully in photos. If you intend to visit more than one Palace it is best to buy the Combination Ticket of 10,000 won as the fee to enter Changdeokgung is 3,000 won and another 5,000 for entry into the secret garden."
188,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace that you are free to explore at your own pace for just $1. The buildings are well maintained and there are several styles to see. Don't miss the concubines area to enjoy some different designs. I couldn't get into see the secret garden as a tour needs to be booked (It takes more than an hour to see it). Even without the garden, it was a lovely place to stroll. We spend an hour or so, and it was enough time. Theres a small coffee shop/gift shop which is a great place to get a drink (we had ginger ice tea and loved it) and then sit inside or out and just enjoy this peaceful place."
189,4.0,"One if the main ancient temples in Seoul. Very cheap entrance fee. Good location in Seoul, not far from other temples."
190,5.0,"This palace is not as big as the other one in Seoul but is as nice or better.  Walk in to the palace and its grounds with a nice lake, it also hosts a nice museum."
191,4.0,We visited Changdeokgung palace on a Sunday around 10am and the crowds have fully yet to arrive. A great time to be there since there is very little shade to beat the heat or cover you from the rain. There are several palaces as you continue to walk inside. There is a small fee to get inside but you will be greeted with a relaxing lotus pond towards the end of the palace.
192,5.0,"This is a beautiful palace, very easy to visit if you are in the insa-dong/bukchon area. It closes at 5pm (I believe) so make sure to check hours before visiting. There's many places around the palacs that will rent you traditional Korean clothing (hanbok) which makes for a fun and memorable photo opportunities!"
193,5.0,We arrived at 9am to ensure we had a place on the 2.30pm Secret Garden Tour (only 50 places per tour available on the day). We then spent the morning at Bukchon Village which is an easy walk away and definitely worth the visit. Palace & Gardens were beautiful and the Garden Tour was a welcome relief from the afternoon sun as it is mostly shaded. Our tour guide was very informative and spoke excellent English. Definitely a must when visiting Seoul.
194,4.0,This palace is great and less tourist packed than Gyeongbokgung Palace.Should be visited along with Gyeongbokgung and Bukchok Hanok village sinse they are all close to each otherIf you really are someone who likes to walk I would recommend the following route.Start from Gwanghwamun station (or City hall station and pass Gwanghwamun gate) -  Gwanghwamun Square -Gwanghwamun Gate - Gyeongbokgung Palace -The folk museum of korea - Bukchok Hanok village - Changdeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream - Gwanghwamun station.
195,5.0,It sits on several acres and contains over 11o buildings.  I was blessed enough to get the free English tour.  A MUST SEE.
196,5.0,"Changdeokgung seems like a smaller version of Gyeongbokgung. As a secondary palace, it pales in comparison to the grandeur and majesty of Gyeongbokgung. However, what sets it apart from the main palace complex is that enclosed in it is Huwon or The Secret Garden. For me, that gives you enough reason to add this to your must-see attractions. Don't miss out on the guided tour specifically meant for Huwon. It's quite lengthy at 90 minutes and involves some trekking but the captivating serenity of this garden; and hearing anecdotes about the Korean monarchs who frequent the garden would make it worth the trouble!"
197,3.0,"If you have limited time.. Or even just don't want to walk about alot, just visit Gyeongbokgung palace. This one is similar but Gyeongbokgung had more to offer."
198,4.0,"the palace was amazing and magnificent ,we took a photos all over the palace ,you need at least 3 hours to see the palace details ,it was good experience to have a look for the Korean historical place"
199,5.0,"If you'd like a real life behind the scenes glimpse of the royal palace's gardens, I highly recommend purchasing a ticket for the Huwon Tour (5000 won for an adult). However, you must first purchase an entry ticket for Changdeokgung itself.I was late to the free Changdeokgung tour, so after buying my Changdeokgung+Huwon tour tickets, I quickly looked at the palaces in Changdeokgung and then hurried over to star the Huwon tour.Very lovely and well maintained, and it's fun seeing that even back then, the royals appreciated nature and art."
200,5.0,When you're in Seoul you should see this palace. It's in the heart of Seoul and close to many other things.
201,5.0,"We visited the Secret Garden, and we had the most loveliest guide, Ms Yoon! We chatted a lots after the tour and she was very interested about our home country and our view about Korea. Secret Garden tour is included in the palace pass, but you need to get a separate ticket before entry at the ticket counter near the gates. This is because the tour holds only 50 people at a time and there are language options (English, Korean, Chinese and if I remember correctly Japanese). Palace pass (tickets for all 5 main palace areas+Secret Garden) is 10,000 won."
202,3.0,"I went there after visiting the Gyeongbokgung palace and for me they look very similar. I can't even distinguish my pictures being taken in both palaces. Maybe the secret garden would have been more interesting, but the ticket for the garden was a  little bit too expensive. I was really bored walking around this palace and took about 10 pictures. I think i needed less than 1 hour.If you have already seen one palace, you can skip this one.The same thing i had to criticize about the Gyeongbokgung: You can never enter the rooms or make a good picture from the intererior."
203,5.0,"This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea, I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also, It was much better to take pictures/hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent."
204,4.0,The place is one of the few historical monuments in the city. It' s pictoresque and if you get beautiful weather it' s a pleasure to walk in. Do not miss secret garden which is the most beautiful and interesting part to visit. Guides in typical korean ancoent costume.
205,3.0,"We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay, nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day. Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by."
206,4.0,First thing when you get there....prepare your energy....very big palace with the beautiful secret garden....This place is easy to found...near angguk station n insadong street....Quite place for relax.....😉
207,5.0,"We visit the palace for the secret garden, it's a must visit if you are here. Join the garden tour, the story and explanation is interesting and meaningful to learn about Korea's culture and history.The garden area is big, everywhere is pretty scenic and serene, surrounded by greens. The atmosphere is just lovely, I bet it would be beautiful during autumn with the fall colors. The tour goes through some slopes and hills, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes for walking. Tour guide was really friendly and is willing to answer all our questions.After the secret garden tour, we visited some other buildings in the palace, there are very similar with other palace, so nothing new for us."
208,5.0,"Please book secret garden tour there,main attraction in the palace. Very quaint place in the middle of the city"
209,5.0,"Do not miss the secret garden tour! It's a must! Very close to the metro station, the English secret garden tour was excellent!"
210,3.0,"Came here on a hot day to try and get in some cultural experiences.  Was an interesting place to walk around and appreciate the historic architecture, but we didn't realize that you have to book inside tours in advance.Worth the quick look, but wouldn't make a big deal of fitting it in if your schedule is full."
211,4.0,"A friend and I took the Secret Garden Tour (1.5 hour tour) and it provided a satisfactory perspective of Korea's history - from its early beginnings to today. Our guide spoke very easy-to-understand English and used an amplifier so that everyone could hear her. I was amazed to see her wearing a traditional hanbok in the heat and humidity!The gardens are very beautiful, feature several water fixtures, and wind through a seemingly endless supply of architecturally beautiful pavilions. It does not feel like you are in the middle of a busy city with all the green trees providing shade overhead.With that said, the tour can still be a little tiring. There are numerous hills and you will walk a fair distance. I would recommend bringing water and insect repellent. There is a cafe at the entrance to the palace and a souvenir shop near the large pond in the Secret Garden Tour. You will find different souvenirs at each so if you see something you like, buy it, as it may not be at the other shops. I purchased a collection of Korean stamps!There were some neat looking trees on the property - one that is believed to be at least 700 years old! There were lots of photo opportunities and the tour guide was good a maintaining a good pace - not too rushed!Recommend if you want to see a palace."
212,4.0,"This was my favorite palace, and was recommended by a local as theirs as well.  It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC, as it was really hot!!!!"
213,4.0,"The two times i went to South Korea, I went to this palace. The reason for the second time was because I was not able to catch the Secret Garden tour and I was with a different set of friends the second time i wentI'm not sure how this palace is compared to the other palaces but i't definitely good for picture taking and it's near the bukchon hanok village :D The first time you arrive here you'll be thrilled by the giant ark at the front. I am not sure how long we spent just to get a perfect picture there. When you go inside, the doors and the koreanovela feels will hit you!(if you are a fan :D). After a while it will feel kind of boring as the palace is very big haha and i'm sure you'll feel tired! But despite this i would definitely recommend this place and the huwon tour i would recommend on autumn or spring because the trees are dry when we got there. After this you can go straight to bukchon hanok for more of the koreanovela feel. :D"
214,4.0,"The great place to visit. Great memory, so the UN heritage site.Should spend 2-3 hours to relax and absorb the atmosphere."
215,4.0,"No, we didn't wear Hanbok to go in but we saw a group of people wearing Hanbok. Latter when I read from Internet said that if you wear Hanbok to visit castle, you will get free entrance. What a waste for us! Imagine wearing Hanbok with the castle as your background! This castle is huge, we took our leisure to walk from one room to another. Each room has explanation on the function in multiple languages. Feels like being transported back to centuries ago in Seoul 😂"
216,5.0,so cultural and explorative i really love wearing hanbok! hahahah it feels like im one of the queens
217,5.0,"This royal palace was much nicer than kyungbok palace.Kyungbok palace was a nice palace but I was much more impressed by this palace.If you have time, You need to visit secret garden of this palace.It's worthy!"
218,5.0,"For me, this is my favorite palace in Seoul. Not as grand as Kyong Bok, but charming in it's own way. Stunning architecture and landscaping. The secret gardens are well worth the extra ticket. Visitors are allowed in small groups of about 50 people at a time. In the Secret Garden (Beewon) you can see magnificent ponds, smaller intimate scale buildings made for the royal family and unusual sets of buildings intended for the royals to ""experience"" a rustic village. The area for poetry writing and drinking is well preserved."
219,4.0,"The palace is very nice but keep in mind it's been rebuilt after being destructed by the Japanese. The palace itself is cozy and not exhausting, interesting to see the layout, but the secret garden is the major attraction here, so please make sure you visit it! It's spread on a relatively wide surface but the alleys are very pleasant and it conveys peace and calm, it's a definite must. You hand to join a tour in order to be able to enter, at specific hours, and it takes about 1.5h but it's totally worth it and the guide was very gifted to transport us in the mood and the stories of the time."
220,4.0,The palace is reachable by subway. Near Mt Namsan. Love the guard changing ceremony. Great place to enjoy the architecture and nature. Great place for a wedding photoshoot is they allow it. Not sure
221,5.0,Very appealing and loaded with history. Stay for the changing of the guard. Beautiful ceremony!  Easy access bu bus and by train. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing. Read ahead and enjoy the history as you walk thru.
222,4.0,An occupied palace fir over 600 years with amazing grounds. The maintenance must be huge but this place is kept in good condition despite the small admission fee. The English secret garden tour at 130pm was great. It's up and over a couple of hills but you see some tranquil and beautiful sights on this tour. Allow a good couple of hours to do it justice.
223,5.0,"If you will visit only one palace, I recommend this one. This palace is smaller than the main palace but still quite large. The palace has a ""Secret garden"" but note that you will have to purchase a separate ticket for that because you may only visit in a group. Perfect for a hot day because in the garden the trees will make a cooling shadow over the paths. The place is very quiet even though it is almost in the heart of Seoul.They sell water in the garden tour with a reasonable price."
224,5.0,It is recommended for you to visit Changdeokgung Palace after you have visited the Gyeongbuk Palace. Don't forget to join the trip to the Secret Garden in the palace as well.
225,4.0,"I went in July which was very warm and humid so if you are going at this time make sure you have plenty of water and sun protection. The visit would have been nicer if the weather was cooler. The entrance fee is 3000 but I would advise you to get the Secret Garden tour which includes the entrance fee at 8000. For a 1.5 hour tour they bring you further inside and you get to see more. The palace is peaceful and beautiful but I was a little underwhelmed. Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace, she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead."
226,5.0,Beautiful palace with rich historical background. Good to wear comfortable walking shoes. Recommended to join guided tour to understand the history. Will do this trip again.
227,5.0,"If you are going to Changdeokgung, secret garden is a must-see. I heard there are limited people allowed to go in the secret garden at one time, so what we did is reserve the slot online. There are several slots of guided tour in Korean, Japanese, English and Chinese. Expect hilly roads so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. But all the breathtaking views make every steps worthwhile to be able to witness with your own eyes and capture inside the memories and photos."
228,5.0,Took the guided tour of the Secret Garden in the palace. Guide was very entertaining and knowledgeable of the history of the place. Approximately 2 hours tour but the area covered is vast and the secret garden really is beautiful.
229,5.0,"There is a secret garden in the palace. In order to get in the garden. You need to buy a ticket which cost 5,000 KWN. You'll go through the garden with a guide."
230,4.0,a very good friend recommended to visit join a tour in the secret garden . but english tours were fully booked and korean tours were still available. we took the korean tour.didnt appreciate much what the tour guide was saying but i admired what i see. very nice view. nice to have photos taken as well. but going uphill or taking the stairs is very tiring. recommended only to those very athletic one
231,2.0,"The palace is considerably smaller than Gyeongbok Palace but this was expected since based on the review I read, it is not the main royal palace.One of the reasons my friend and I went to Changdeok Palace was its Secret Garden, as it is one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. The way it was advertised was that it is a very splendid and romantic place but the reality was far from it and in my opinion, it is not representative to be a royal garden. Even worse was that we had to pay separate entrance fees for the palace and the garden and that of the garden is more expensive."
232,5.0,Allow plenty of time to visit this palace is you are going to do the Secret Garden guided tour (recommended). Bring water and good walking shoes!
233,5.0,"My guide book said this one is the smaller and less impressive of the two imperial palaces. I disagree. The ground seemed bigger, more buildings and a ""secret garden"". The garden requires a separate ticket but worth the money. As with the ""bigger"" palace, there are many building that you cannot walk into, just look into. There grounds are more landscaped, even outside of the ""secret garden"" . If you only have time to go to one palace, go to this one."
234,5.0,"It was a rainy day but we already booked a tour in the Secret Garden. The secret garden tour was totally worth it. There a lot of hiking and walking so wear comfortable shoes. If you are wearing hanbok (can be rent from a shop opposite the palace), you can a free entry to the palace (not the secret garden). It is the best location to do some photoshooting as well.There are only one place where the toilet is in the palace and another one in the secret garden."
235,4.0,We booked in advance for the Palace and Secret Garden English guided tours. Both guides were informative and engaging. It was a hot day and we were quite exhausted after 2.5 hours but nonetheless a interesting break from all the shopping in Seoul.
236,5.0,Great tour...very interesting history. Our tour guide communicated some very interesting facts. Covers alot of ground and the decor was beautiful.
237,4.0,I went their in May 2016 from India. The place had an temp of around 24 degree Celsius. for me it was like waaoww... Nice palace in mountains with a beautiful scenery around. it is a small half and hour drive from Seoul city and an ideal place to spend your evening.
238,4.0,"The best part if this palace that distinguished it from the others is the Secret Garden. When we went there, the Secret Garden is only accessible via group guided tours and we are not allowed to wander off on our own in order to ensure the garden is well preserved. We booked for the guided English tour online before we flew to Seoul. Our lady guide was excellent, her English command is very good and at each place she would tell us the history & story behind the spots that we visited. Normally every year during Spring, they would also have night tours to the garden. Do note that the guided night tour is only open for foreigners an only available on 1 day or max 2 days per month ( I think they chose the nights with full moon). Among the 5 palaces, I would recommend this palace to visit other than Gyengbokgung."
239,4.0,"Visited on a Saturday morning, a little busy but not overwhelming. Excellent guide, good English. First tour takes an hour around the main palace. Visit the secret garden,it is well worth it. Tour takes an hour and a half. No food allowed but you can buy water half way round. It is a bit hilly but worth the trek. Make sure you leave enough time for your first tour and the secret garden. You reserve as specific time for the secret garden. Also the traffic was bad so if you are travelling by taxi leave enough time. Well worth the visit, a small piece of history in the centre of this modern city"
240,5.0,Great palace to show how old people are leaving with fantastic place I went there by a taxi from myeongdong around 6000kw ( $5) and you can walk to there around 1.8 km The tickets 3000 kw and if you want with secret garden 8000 kw There time table to visit secret garden for foreign and it take 1.30 hours only rounding in secret garden
241,4.0,"The palace itself is disappointing, but the secret garden is amazing. The garden is extensive and the tour is available in English. Personally found the tour to be a little crowded. Would have preferred to spend some quite time in the gardens instead."
242,4.0,We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.
243,4.0,"Due to various korean soap operas that I've watched, I was really interested in these special castles. It is a huge symbol of the pure korean or far east architecture. Fantastic garden in shape of a jungle with an awesome lake in the heart of it. Totally the environment is unbelievably soothing and relaxing. The main problem was its accessibility, public transportation is not really around the area and it took 30 minutes for us to get there from a subway station."
244,5.0,"Changdeokgung Palace is huge! When entering the palace, you would get the feel of the Jeoson era. You could imagine the Royalties walking through the corridors of the palace dressed in their royal garbs. Inside Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden, only accessible for when you join a tour. I would suggest to join the tour as it would give you more insight about the history of the garden and why it's given a special place."
245,5.0,The garden in the palace is natural and beautiful. Felt so relax and could easily spend half a day strolling around myself. We did the walking tour which was great to get some insights on the history.
246,5.0,"My friend and I thought that this palace was closed, but because of their celebration of experiencing to meet the palaces (Sorry I forgot the terms), we were able to see a different attraction since South Korea has a lot of palaces. We visited the Secret Garden. If you bought a Combination Ticket (worth 10,000 KRW), there's a different attachment for voucher in going to the Secret Garden. If you want to have the tour of the Secret Garden and you bought the combination ticket, go to the ticketing office first to convert the voucher to a ticket in going to the said tour. We had the 3:30 English tour and it ended at around 5 though what my friend and I was we went ahead of those who had the English tour and savoured the moment of taking pictures of sceneries and ourselves. But I'd say it's nice to also listen to the pieces of information that I heard from the tour guide about the Secret Garden since the curiosity of knowing why it is the Secret Garden is explained in the tour."
247,4.0,A must visit in Korea..You cannot tell that you'd visited Korea if you hadn't paid a visit to this place --- July 2013 and March 2014
248,5.0,"The official Seoul tourist map suggests that this palace is above and the other one is close to the metro station. Yet it seems to be a bit different and I got really confused as I thought I was in the other palace. The main gate (from the south west corner off the park, next to the metro station) will get you to this Palace. The other one is more on the east of the park. You can walk from one palace to the other without getting out from the park. Both of the palaces are really nice but lots of open space thus on sunny day make sure you have a hat otherwise you'll end up with a mild sun stroke."
249,5.0,"I love this palace much more than Cheongbokung Palace. This is more interesting, near secret garden and Hanok Village. It is very easy to go by MRT or Airport Bus limousine."
250,4.0,"Worth a visit if you are a history or nature lover. Changedeokgung Palace is one of the UNESCO World Heritage, which was built in 1405 by the king of the Joseon Dynasty. The architectural style is simple and frugal.  Behind the palace, there is a Secret Garden which was intended the use of the royal family. It is a beautiful and spacious built landscape. The ticket center staff could not speak English well. Please be prepared it may take longer time than expected to buy the ticket. As I visited during the windy day, part of the Secret Garden was closed.  Remember to check before you go."
251,4.0,"Great gardens all around this palace, lovely colourful  azaleas while we were there in April. Nice little oasis away from hustle and bustle of the busy city. Free entry if over 65 and no ID proof required"
252,5.0,I booked the secret garden tour and the guide is very funny and nice. He explained a lot of things in a fun way.
253,5.0,when I.pass here they got celebrationcan wear the traditional costume for.free so niceehopes next time will get.this.chance also
254,5.0,"A perfect palace to visit if you have only limited time. Entry price includes a tour at set times for various languages. Well worth it. If you can spare the 1.5 hrs for a Secret Garden tour, the other tourists say this is well worth it. Well maintained and lovely grounds with a rich Korean history."
255,3.0,"The second most important palace in Seoul, still worth a visit. Can't say I noticed anything special about it when I was there, it's less crowded than Gyeongbokgung."
256,4.0,Not a bad place to spend an hour although it lacked much to do once inside. Some good restaurants close by though! Worth a visit if bored.
257,5.0,"Have been to Seoul a few times already but this time was the first time I had visited this palace. We opted for the additional Secret Garden tour. I am so glad I did, as the gardens were truly beautiful. The gardens can only be viewed by taking part in the guided tour. It was conducted by a quide who's english was clear and easy to understand. She was quite humourous and informative throughout.The only thing I would say is that the tour lasts for 1.5hours and involves some inclines, so comfortable walking shoes are a must. Definitely worth a visit."
258,4.0,"I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before I came here. We could walk there, but we used the Gyeongbokgung station to Anguk station instead, from here, we walk along Bukchon Hanok Village, then straight to Changdeokgung. (we bought combination tickets for 4 palaces and Jongmyo Shrine, and I was surprised these include the Secret Garden in this palace, otherwise we need to pay extra 5000₩ for the tour)I think it is more well preserved than the Gyeongbokgung palace. I love this place more, you can walk along the path of the ancient people of Korea and the Royals used to walk. Personally, it was an amazing experience for me. Some of my friends got tired easy though, I guess it's not for everyone.Lots of picture taking activity."
259,3.0,"This palace is not as big and extensive as Gyeongbuk-gung palace but has a lot of charm. It is part of the Secret garden complex that can only be seen with a tour group (at the palace ticket counters about W5,000) There are both korean and English tours but they do sell out fast over weekends with good weather."
260,4.0,"We went by the place very quickly on our way to the Secret Garden. The garden was pretty and it was interesting to see where the royals relaxed, entertained guests and where the prince studied. The garden would be more beautiful during the fall foliage or the spring/summer bloom. The tour was 90 min and require quite a bit of walking and some stairs. Would not recommend for those with difficulty walking. The guide was quite knowledgable and shared some good information."
261,4.0,"One of the important palaces in Seoul, and a UNESCO world heritage site, this is surely a must-visit! Take some time to walk around the palace grounds and see the different areas of the palace."
262,4.0,Only spend less than 2 hours as it was pretty rushed for time. Visited some of the prominent attractions and there were sakura trees in sight at this point of the year as well. Probably need to spend one full day at this attraction in order to give a more accurate rating.
263,4.0,"This is more Korean style palace. That is, it is built according to the nature. The other one - Gyeongbokgung - is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn't cut down on hills and trees. So it's pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays, but the secret garden - something more famous - must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group, there usually are some tickets available at the spot, but I wouldn't risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes."
264,4.0,"This place is fantastic.  Took me 2 hours to see it all, it's a very big property with the palace, hall, queens room, secret gardens and lake park.  Built in the 1400's, take a moment to read each plaque so you know what you are looking at."
265,4.0,"The castle was okay but not mesmerising for me. If you are into castles and history, China will be a better country to visit."
266,3.0,I recommend this place to dress up and get some Korean style pictures on a sunny day. The old palace is the perfect setting for some great compositions of memorable pictures
267,3.0,"After visiting Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is nothing too grand. The Secret Garden is the highlight of this place, so make sure you make your reservation online (no booking/admission payment required until ticket redemption at the booth). They are very strict with the timing so do arrive 20 minutes before the tour time. We were 10 minutes earlier and we had to join the next session. It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn't bloomed so the secret garden wasn't at its prettiest. The place is very mystical, scenic and calming, ZEN. Our tour guide was super sassy, entertaining in a way. There'll be alot of walking so make sure you're in proper walking shoes!"
268,5.0,"Though not huge like the castles and palaces in Europe, the palace grounds were tranquil and spacious. The Secret Garden is a must see, with its beautiful pavilions and ponds. The hilly terrain is not recommended for those with knee problems though. Our tour guide was Kim, who was beautiful and eloquent. I wish I could spend more time here, it was probably the highlight of my Korea trip."
269,5.0,"Visit this place and buy the package. The place is  worth the visit. Look at it in the perspective of history. We went here in winter but there is a bit foliage,"
270,5.0,ENjoy the ceremony of the changing of the guard where real Korean's are the actors dressed in their ceremonial garb.
271,5.0,If you go here purcahse the tour it is well worth it. We had the greatest time. When someone explains everything to you it is better!!
272,5.0,"Changdeokgung is not as big as Gyeongbokgung, but this palace is more quiet in terms of tourist flow than Gyeongbokgung. If you come early on the morning, you hear the birds singing and hear the nice sound of the wind, so if you are a nature lover this is your spot. The entrance admission is 3000 KRW (3 USD), so it is the same as Gyeongbokgung.Overall, this is my favorite Korean palace, not only because it is a World Heritage, but because it has a good blend of being for tourists and locals. Also, the architecture is more trendy and the palace itself has a more clear path to look around.Good location, located around 5 minutes from the Anguk metro station.TIP: Closed on Mondays. It may get busy on Tuesdays, because Gyeongbokgung is closed on that day."
273,5.0,"Should pay a visit to the palace, the only one palace in Korea that has Western architecture, and make your time to observe the gate exchange session as well, very happening & nice cultural experience."
274,5.0,창덕궁 a/k/a Changdeokgung is a magnificent palace property.  It's been well maintained and is a fantastic historic UNESCO site.  The Secret Garden is a must and is stunning.  Our visit was actually in Oct. 2014.  I'm looking firward to taking my daughter and granddaughter.
275,4.0,"This was a nice Palace, we were fortunate as there was a ""changing of the guard"" ceremony going on that was entertaining(and free)."
276,3.0,"This palace occupies a large tract of land like all palaces of importance should. What you find here is only the empty structure, suppose the secret garden would have made this more agreeable, but we were have no intention to wait for guided tour, and additonal cost to visit."
277,5.0,"If you want to indulge yourself with historic events when you travel Seoul, do not forget to include Changdeokgung Palace in your itinerary. It is surprising how they preserved the Palace after hundreds of years. The vibrant details of the roofs, the cornerstones, even the passageways remain the same as it was before. The place is so huge you'd get tired to tour around it for just one day, but it's definitely rewarding if you do. Let your imagination play the game while you are in Changdeokgung Palace!"
278,4.0,The Palace highlight is its Secret Garden. The Architecture was great but the Garden stole the show. Magnificently quiet and calm. It will give you a glimpse on how the Korean royals spend their time inside this beautiful but enclose structure.
279,5.0,The highlight of the place is definitely the tour to the Secret Garden. The other parts won't be anything new if you've already visited Gyeongbokgung.We visited the place in autumn and the garden was simply amazing.
280,5.0,Place time and art are amazing. In this huge modern world peace of history is standing and waiting to be explored. Palace is amazing garden looks wonderful and show was breathtaking. Worth going
281,5.0,We went here after we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace since it is close to each other. Its very similar with the Gyeongbokgung Palace. They also have an entrance fee of 3000 won and also offers guided tours. It is also on of the UNESCO heritage site in Korea I guess if you are into architecture and design this is a place to be visited.
282,4.0,Best way to explore is to join a free English tour of the palace.The guide introduces the history of the palace and walks you toward the most significant building!
283,5.0,Cater more time to walk about in this palace. Do stay for the hourly change of guards ceremony at the entrance to the palace. This palace is huge and there are a lot of parts of this palace to be explored.
284,5.0,"Plan a few hours in here, the grounds are huge, and there are many nooks and crannies to visit. Best if you bring a guidebook that tells the story of what each section represents. From grandiose main palaces to servant quarters, take your time to soak in the history and beauty of the ancient times and gardens"
285,5.0,I loved it such a nice walk around the grounds and see the cherry blossoms around. very nice local history and full of surprising stories
286,4.0,"You can take a subway to this place, or if you stay near Jongno-gu, you can walk. I recommend to visit this place in the morning as there are not many tourirts, and you can experience a peaceful time"
287,5.0,"Best of the palaces within Seoul and easily combined with a wander round Bokcheon village. Don't miss the BiWon ""Secret Garden"". It is an extra W3000 but well worth the guided-only tour. Don't wait for a specific language tour since the tour guides are very dry and just spew endless dates and facts, just take the nearest time to your arrival.  I have been more than a dozen times with friends and family and it still impresses"
288,4.0,When I went I got to see the changing of the guard ceremony.  It was very epic and took about 15-20 mins to complete.  Got some cool photos and videos.  The guard where traditional ceremonial warrior garb and stand motionless and still out in front of the entrance to the palace.  It's pretty cool that they still carry the tradition.  The palace is very impressive.  It's so big you can barely take a picture of it.  Definitely check it out.
289,5.0,We visited Changdeokgung Palace because the other Palace was closed.  It was quite a surprise to see the many different buildings and their uses especially the heating system under the flooring.  The Secret Garden was the highlight of the garden tour which I would recommend to visitors.
290,5.0,"Rich history & beautiful architectural design! The grounds are very clean, however, I'm concerned the inside of the palace are exposed to the elements."
291,5.0,Don't miss the secret garden. An extra ticket but well worth it. We were there on the peak foliage week and the trees were magnificent.
292,5.0,This was my favorite palace. So beautiful and full of nature! It's a great place for taking photos on a sunny day.
293,4.0,Secret garden is a must when you visit this palace. The scenery is very beautiful at the secret garden but a lot of walking to do with 1and half hours of guided tours.
294,4.0,This charming palace is UNESCO heritage sight. Make sure you pay extra for guided tour. This palace is located right next to other attraction such as Hanok village which will only take 15 to 20 min. walk.
