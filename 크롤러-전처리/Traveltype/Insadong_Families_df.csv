0,5.0,I wish we had a lot of time to spend here. We were in a tour and had a limited time to go around. Lots of food to taste. A lot of things to see. A lot of stores to shop. I'll come back for sure.
1,4.0,Nice area to buy nice stuff for our return... Handmade or tourists ones but that's OK 😊 for instance we bought sets of Korean metal sticks and spoons for a very reasonable price which we did not find elsewhere.
2,4.0,"Another shopping area close to Gyeongbokgung palace. This street has a lot of cafes and souvenir shops. Sampled a few types a tea in one of the newer establishments, however there are a lot of traditional tea houses to explore. Lots of good restaurants in and round the by lanes."
3,4.0,Went from the train station to the running man attraction and then up and down the street trying to hunt for trick eye museum. Also went up to one restaurant on the second floor to have dagarbj with cheese and octopus. To cap it off it was snowing gently that day. Beautiful
4,3.0,"This old area of Seoul is well known for tea houses and there's also a handful of lovely old restaurants.For us, it was a visit to Ssamzie-gil to get our family caricature done. A must when you are there."
5,5.0,"Visited in mid December. I prefer this area more than Myeongdong. Lots of eateries, and lots of shops selling souvenirs. There are also shops selling cosmetics. So, if you are not a hardcore cosmetic person, you can actually shop around this area too. Ssamziegil is also a place worth visiting. It consists of little boutiques, stores/ shops selling cute little knick knacks. Just about opposite Ssamziegil, there is a toy museum and a tea house/ cafe. They have some pretty yummy looking desserts. We’ve only tried their green tea ice cream, so i can’t comment on their other desserts or drinks. There is also a huge shopping mall near Ssamziegil."
6,3.0,Walked pass this street on the way to The Runningman Thematic Experience Centre. Did not strike me as exciting or there is much to do. Visit only if you are around the area.
7,4.0,"If you are going for a relaxing holiday, this is the place which you can find a lots of cafe.  There are some street foods as well."
8,5.0,Nice vivid street almost without cars with a lot of interesting shops to look and buy topical Korean stuff. Lots of street food as well
9,4.0,"When you come to Seoul you can experience different shopping experience based on which market place you visit. Insadong has it's own nuance when it comes to shopping.  If you are in to masks, you will see lot of shops not only selling them but you will find some shops where you can watch a mask being made. Just like any other place in Asia, one should be able to bargain"
10,5.0,"Staying in MyeongDong, it was a fun and healthy walk over to Insadong to see the modern buildings and restaurants, plus see the great heritage site with local tour guides! They were awesome. The food here is spectacular for everyone with an Asian hankering .. and of course we arranged a must see DMZ tour the next day.. Seoul is 1st class!"
11,4.0,"You want to experience Korea, visit this area.Souvenir shops, korean restos, korean neighborhood, antique shops are the things you will enjoy here. If you want handcrafted bags, ceramics, arts then this is your place. But i find the commodities more expensive than in myeongdong. We stayed for 2 nights in this area and its quiet and exciting due to lots of restaurant nearby. Its just next to each other. Restaurants are the one you see in korean novelas where there are individual rooms for every guest. The area is close to palaces, airport bus station and subway ."
12,4.0,"We took almost an hour of train from Gangnam's Handuk station to Anguk station.  Took the exit 6 and Insadong's main street is just 200 meters away. The street is filled with restaurants local and international, shops selling souvenirs, cafes, tea house, etc. In the heart of it is a building called Ssamziegil with its spiralling floors. You may want to pay the Ddong cafe aka poop cafe a visit.The main street will be branched out to many gil (Lane) in Korean. In those gils you will find mainly restaurants. Few of the popular ones we visited are in 12gil (bbq),8gil (sujebi noodle), 9gil (dumplings) .It's gets livelier during the evening around 6pm to 9pm. Overall this is a place where you wouldn't want to miss when visiting Seoul."
13,5.0,"Worth to come. Because many variety of souvenirs in here. Price not so expensive,, i recommend this store in pic, because she gave us so many bonus for my kids haha"
14,4.0,This place is a place to buy souvenir where you also can find unique mall called ssamziegil. Best to go is in weekend noon to evening.
15,5.0,"We traveled to Seoul and we couldn’t find better area than  Insadong. Here you can walk and visit the best palaces, villages and more, you can also shop and have a great meals.Definitely convenient area with good transport connectivity bus and subway."
16,4.0,Interesting area full of shops and restaurants. You can find normal gift items to rare find art items. Go through the little alleys and find some of the best restaurants.
17,3.0,"To me, this is an area that doesn't worth revisiting. Restaurants are expensive but not yummy at all. The shopping centre is not fabulous either. It's a quieter and more traditional area. Visiting once is enough."
18,5.0,"Located in easily walkable distance between the palaces and Myeongdong, this small area should be visited for cheap souvenirs, also must visit the fun mini shopping arcade called Ssamziegil."
19,5.0,A series of old school fashioned shops and tea/coffee houses.  Certainly worth a look.  Had a fantastic relaxed time at a tea house there.
20,4.0,"Originally there were many of traditional shops and tea cafes prviously but it turned morden style a lot but still many things to see and take a picture for insta. In the small alleys there are old resturants what you can enjoy Korean traditional food not only Bulgoggies but also Korean rice wine. You can reach on foot from Kyungbok palace, Changkyung palace,  Hanok village, Jongro and so on. You can walk 10,000 steps easily."
21,4.0,"If it’s hot this is an awesome place to cool down, with a shared bowl of shaved ice cream with condensed milk you can pour over that really brings out the taste of the shaved ice whether you start with chocolate or mango or any of the other multitude of flavours."
22,4.0,The town has different look from Seoul which has tall building forest and is crowded. The town has lots of low ceiling stores. You can see Korean traditional goodies or restaurants in the town. It’s an interesting place. Prices seem a bit overpriced through.
23,4.0,"I like it here as I am into culture. Beautiful lanes with beautiful structure. It was a nice stroll going down the lanes. Saw some tourist dressed up in the traditional outfits, beautiful indeed. Spent sometimes browsing the souvenirs shops.  I truly enjoyed this place."
24,2.0,"I’m not sure what we expected, but this tourist-street wasn’t it. We did have a decent lunch in a side alley off the main drag, but the whole area just felt a bit fake and touristy. Possibly not, but the rest of the week in Seoul, we barely met any non-domestic tourists, and Insadong just felt a bit like a Western tourist hub. There are far nicer to see Korean traditions than here."
25,5.0,"It was so pleasant walking around every street.  So many restaurants and shops everywhere.  It's not as crowded as Myeongdong and prices are much better as well.  Nice, quaint shops and food was really good."
26,5.0,"Well, you know how these places usually are. Same things over and over, with prices varying two-fold. Stuff made in China... You know what I'm talking about. All this can be found here, BUT to much less extent than you would usually see. Quite a few unique hand-made artifacts, lots of ""art galleries"" along the street and further to the sides. Quite reasonable prices as well. The must if you are after something local to bring back home."
27,4.0,"If you’re looking for a place to buy local souvenirs this is it. There are a bunch of local shops catered to locals more than tourists. There is also a buda temple near by. There is some street food too. Not far from the palace, it’s a short 5-10 minute walk."
28,5.0,"Great location to buy gifts for tourists to bring back home.The prices are reasonable and you get the feeling for Korean made goods and its culture.There are places to eat along the beaten path. Its a quick walk and worth spending your time here in the evening before you go to get your gifts.Its not easy to find off the metro, as there are many exits to the street from below and depending which one you take you have to walk a bit to get to the district.The prices range from inexpensive to fairly expensive. Bring your wallet and walking shoes."
29,5.0,"I love the feel of this place...traditional and modern at the same time. It's a nice area to shop here as there are so many shops, souvenirs and cafes."
30,4.0,"We went there to eat and found there were multiple alleys and that each alley had several restaurants. We didn't know this and immediately chose a restaurant on the first alley we entered. We thought of buying trinkets from Insadong to bring home but because the shops on the main street are more of artisan shops showcasing handmade crafts. We waited till we got to Namdaemun market to buy cheap goods instead. (Stingy, I know. In my defense we bought in bulk so it wouldn't be cost effective for us to buy exclusive items.)"
31,5.0,Not cheap though but very nice place. Also family friendly. You can bring your kids and do shopping.
32,5.0,"Awesome street. It’s a mixture of Korean culture and everything else. Shopping for traditional stuff and modern items for gifts or personal use. Locally made and imported items. Hanbok rentals, cafes and restaurants for all tastes. And, of course, the street food. Nice people there too. On 2 stores I bought some items in, they gave out some free stuff. Maybe I was just lucky, but ut did give me a good impression of the neighborhood. One can spend a whole day there. Also nice for people watching, specially at this time of year (spring)."
33,5.0,Insadong is a charming street to walk through. Lots of artsy stores and souvenir shops. Small eateries give you great food choices.
34,4.0,A good place to spend an afternoon here walking the shops and having tea at one of the teahouses especially the old traditional types.
35,5.0,"We took a stroll down Insadong, visiting various stores along the way. The scarves, pottery and traditional paintings on fans and wall hangings were fun to look at and peruse. We picked up some treasures but enjoyed the opportunity to experience this colorful street of arts and crafts."
36,2.0,"Lovely street with art , calligraphy, paper, Pottery shops. K-pop stores- BTS , black pink merchandise . Many cafes and local Korean cuisine"
37,4.0,"This is an charming place where old but precious and traditional goods are on display. There are alleys on each side of this charming road. Within these alleys are galleries and traditional restaurants, teahouses, and cafes. A must visit while in Seoul."
38,3.0,"I have 3 daughters, 1 son and 1 wife... They shopped for 4 hours while me and my son waited in 2 coffee shops. I just loved the street food and watching people spend all their money shopping! Haha"
39,5.0,"Insa-dong provided us with many souvenirs, treats, and fun experiences! We enjoyed walking, eating and shopping our way through Insa-dong and would recommend you visit if you are looking to find Name Chops, the Ddong Cafe, or dragon candy."
40,4.0,There are lots of nice shops with handmade items and a few restaurants but definitely the place to come for cheap trinkets to take home for friends and family.
41,3.0,"I just go there for photostop. Need only 1 hour to explore Insadong. I dont like Ssamziegil. Here we only see the traditional house, people are wearing hanbok and some souvenir shops."

44,5.0,This place is a walking distance from our hotel and every night I’ve walked around to this street to buy street food. It’s also the street where you can find bargains. There’s also a restaurant on that street that specialize a braised beef ribs that it’s so delicious. We ate at the restaurant 4 times and ordered the same thing all the time.
45,4.0,"December is peak season, so the streets, food stalls and stores were busy, but still pleasant enough to enjoy.Not as big and exciting as Myeongdong Street, but has its own vibe.Look out for Ddong Bread. Weird but must be tried."
46,5.0,The kids totally enjoy the craft work at the basement of insadong. Good to have more unusual craftwork there available for kids.
47,5.0,"If you want a quiet place to shop minus the crowd, we find Insadong is a good choice. Also sufficient restaurants around to satisfy your empty stomach too."
48,3.0,"Mostly souvenir shops with restaurants and coffee shops in between. If you’re looking for more shops with a wide variety of merchandise and tax-free goods, better go to Myeongdong."

Of course, there are many souvenir shops and eateries, the latter of which you should explore the little lanes and alley ways and you will find many of these eateries, some of which are packed. The mall Ssamzigil is Aldo worth a visit, as it is made up of many stores selling very unique items."

64,5.0,"Insadong area gives you surprises as some of their shops, I can say most of the shops are selling unique stuffs which we enjoy going into every shops to check thing out, really worth to walk around and spend some time in this area.

Every small shops in there carry their own products and we spend like hours to check every single one out."
65,5.0,"We stayed in Insadong - I loved it. It was filled with lots of eateries in alleyways that had a lot of locals - that is, for us, a sign of a good local resturant.

70,3.0,I imagined the main Insadong area being much larger and was slightly disappointed. The area is very nice however with tree covered walking areas and helpful information center staff. Area has a large amount of private art gallery and supplies stores. Some very good family-run restaurants are located here in the many narrow alleys!
71,4.0,Insadong street is the place to be for artsy people ! I must say that this place offer really unique art pieces and you can also enjoy traditional tea houses that offer varieties of Korean tea and Traditional korean snacks. I bought some of Korean souvenirs for friends back at home and I must say that the prices are pretty cheap (you can do some bargain at some of the souvenirs shop). Really recommended to visit for those who are looking for Korean Souvenirs or those who enjoy arts.
72,4.0,"Great street with various shops - juju tea, art & craft, fashion, galleries & plenty of traditional restaurants.But try not to go in the weekend as it gets very busy!"
73,4.0,We stayed near Insadong Street.  By walking distance one will be able to access to many tourist spot and Metro Station. Good place to recommend tourist.
74,4.0,Went in February. This is more the artistic side of South Korea. You can wear traditional korean costumes and no one will bat an eye. Apparently the only starbucks in the world with the logo in another language is here. A definite tourist location.
75,4.0,"This is one of the most well-known touristic streets in Jongro. Especially for foreign tourists.There are many average souvenir shops, fancy cafes and restaurants.So, visitors need to study in advance to avoid tourist traps and to get real good ones. Or spend some time to hang around.I am a bit disappointed to hardly find affordable tea houses, though."
76,3.0,There are plenty of restaurants and shops that sell traditional pieces/artwork. The street is not very long. You can tour the whole place in an hour or two.

78,4.0,"We decided to visit Insadong on our first day. We took subway line 4 to Chungmuro and transfer to line 3 Angguk Station. At first we were a bit confused with subway system but help of kind Korean people (oppa and unni) we were able to ride the subway without worries. Due to heavy rain, no stalls were set up along the road when we arrived at Insadong. We decided to visit the Ssamzeigil. Then, we went to Ohsegyehyang (vegetarian restaurant) for dinner, however the kitchen did not provide us with many options of menu. Noted that this restaurant was a traditional restaurant, the clients had to open their shoes and sit on the floor. We only had choice to eat bibimbap but the dish was delicious and full our stomach. The tourist centre at the entrance of Insadong was very helpful in showing us the direction and gave us maps. This place was nearby to Hanok Village and Cheongyecheon stream."
79,5.0,Nice place for tea and bingeing.The lady is very friendly and do not visit this place in the weekend.fully pack
80,3.0,"Insadong as an area looked to be pretty touristy and gimmicky. The Insadong PR and Tourist Info center was good for hanbok pictorials (only $3 per person). The Jogyesa Temple was a calming place to catch your breath. I would go here again to try out the teahouses in the area. Ssamzigil mall has a lot of touristy gimmicks: if you have time to spend, you can check those out, but if not, I'd recommend steering clear."
81,5.0,"Located in the Anguk area which has several tourist attractions around this metro stop, Insa Dong is a traditional Korean market street with pottery, books, artefacts and other cultural things like wooden containers on sale."
82,4.0,This place you get to see a little side of old Korea.. Of course you can find lots of souvenirs and food place..
83,5.0,Nice area to walk around. Small interesting places to eat and shop. Friendly shop keepers and not bery crowded in morning. Many shops did not open until 10am. But maybe that was because it was summer.
84,4.0,"Very beautiful, lively and colourful. Perfect place to buy unique souvenirs. A long walk. Unique keychains.. Korean handicrafts...bright colourful pouches."
85,5.0,"Ok - this is the street for ""non-tradiitonal"" Korean shopping.  AKA a tourist trap.  Well, we went to several other traditional markets.  Those are interesting experiences, but we didn't really find any good gifts to bring back home.  Plus they are crowded and have several unfriendly vendors.In Insadong, we found many friendly shops filled with different gifts at good prices.  Jade bracelets, artwork, cartoon socks, hand fans, jewelry boxes...I think the subway requires a transfer and some walking, so we just took taxi for $10 each way from Hongik Univ"
86,5.0,This was one of our favorite places. There are several Korean Tea Houses and Korean Barbecue places to eat at. But what is nice is no cars are aloud it is pedestrian only. The shops are mainly hand made by the korean people. Great place to buy gifts. I am a hat girl and bought 7 hats to take home with me. Fun day here for sure.
87,4.0,"This is a very lively area with lots of shops selling paintings, souvenirs and other handicrafts.  There are also interesting little shops and traditional restaurants in the smaller side streets."
88,3.0,"a great place in the city to pick up souvenirs like metal bookmarks, key rings, magnets, chop sticks, handicrafts, mother of pearl jewelry/display boxes as well as more unique keepsakes. There is a Hanbok photo place at the Tourist Information centre if you just want to put one on and take a photo. Picked up some lovely jeweled for cheap here. Lots of little places to eat off the street in little laneways. We found a tiny place doing Mandoo (dumplings) which was fabulous, a really authentic feel. The cart selling cocktails amused us.Pick up some cash on your way here. I ran out and it was hard to find an ATM, let alone one that took my card!!"
89,5.0,If you are looking for souvenirs that’s the place not to miss in Seoul. Plus there are a lot of Korean traditional restaurants. Don’t miss out the shop that is dedicated only to tea from Jeju island. Unfortunately I don’t remember the name but surely it will be hard to miss as it’s always crowed. They sell and serve delicious green tea deserts and different tea drinks. Just amazing. We went there second time after a few days just to taste something else before we leave.
90,5.0,"Insadong is a ten minute walk from myongdong.just across from dongdemun.went to a lovely cat cafe there.ate at little India cafe, it the curry was just ordinary,trust me I’m a chef myself.but at least it was meat.lovelt casual area for soeveneirs and shopping."

Its made from fermented honey and corn flour with peanut& sesame filling. They have chocolate flavour,green tea,almond and plain. All the fillings inside remains same only the outer part flavour changes. They make the candies right in front of your eyes."
100,5.0,My family and I paid a visit to Insadong in the afternoon. There were many shops in the area as well as some rather interesting tea houses. We visited 2 of the tea houses where we enjoyed our afternoon tea and snacks. Overall it was a wonderful place to spend a lazy afternoon.

Got to try Korean dumplings (Mandu) and Korean Dragon's beard candy."

113,5.0,"Insadong is a small shopping street filled with souvenir shops and interesting food joints. I visited almost all the main shopping areas in Seoul, but enjoyed Insadong the most for souvenirs. Its also a very nice place to walk around window shopping as well.

115,5.0,"Nice place to shop for traditional Korean items. The shops pretty much sell the same items, some are expensive than others, you really have to go to atleast 3-4 stores to get an idea of price on items you like. There’s restos yowards the end of the street, PooPoo Land is here, they sell poop emoji- shaped bread with chocolate filling... lots of small crafty shops and boutiques"
116,4.0,It’s a lovely place to get art and craft items for souvenirs. I got handcrafted hanbok cards and magnetic memo pegs for gifts at reasonable prices. Just browse at the shops along the Main Street. We also visited the Poop cafe on the top floor of Samsziegiel and enjoyed the novelty of it.
117,5.0,I love the street so much! It’s so relaxing walking there with a lot of antique shops around. The street is not that busy and peak as Myeongdong and other shopping street.
118,5.0,"I’ve been living in Insadong for over 8 months now and can confirm the area is a “must visit” in every season. Probably 80-90% of tourists never leave the main shopping street, Insadong 9-gil, which is lined with art supply shops, galleries, hanbok rental places, traditional clothing boutiques, pottery shops, tourist shops selling trinkets and k-pop paraphernalia, traditional tea houses and other places of interest to visitors and locals alike. The famous Ssamzie-gil mall is fun to wander through and it has a great selection of small boutiques run by craftspeople - don’t miss the rooftop “poop cafe” for their instagrammable latte served in a toilet mug!Do yourself a favor though, and take a turn in any direction off the main drag and wander down the back alleys. Don’t worry, this is one of the safest cities on earth so you won’t be mugged or harassed in any way! Wandering down the dark and twisty back alleys of the area, you will discover a whole other world of funky old hansik (traditional) restaurants, makgeoli taverns, street art, traditional tea houses, tiny independent shops, and surprising discoveries of all kinds.Grab lunch at one of the local restaurants specializing in old-fashioned Korean specialties that are hard to find in other countries like Sujebi (a light, nourishing soup with strips of rough pasta dough and mussels), jjimdak (chicken stew with carrots, potatoes, and glass noodles available in mild to spicy), mandu (korean dumplings), sweet soy beef ribs, samgyetang (delicious whole chicken stuffed with rice and stewed with ginseng until it’s falling off the bone), and delicious jeon (large fried pancakes made from scallions, mung bean, kimchi, seafood, or potato) of various kinds. Leave room for hotteok, Korea’s astoundingly delicious version of fried dough - this one is stuffed with honey and cinnamon and deep fried. Skip the long lines at the stand at the corner of Insadong 4-gil and instead try the one near the corner of Jongno-ro at the far southern end of the shopping area - their dough is much lighter and puffy and absolutely addictive! Beware the center is like liquid magma - you WILL burn your mouth and get sticky hands but you will have no regrets at all!Insadong is very lively and touristy by day but tends to shut down almost entirely by 8-9pm, when the action moves to other nearby areas like Jonggak’s “Avenue of Youth” and uber-hipster Iksondong or further afield to the party/club areas of Hongdae and Itaewon."
119,5.0,"DISCLAIMER: I am a huge fan of arts and craft and anything locally made, so this was like heaven for me.Our hotel Concierge recommended us to visit the district of Insa-dong as a sightseeing destination for the 'older part of Seoul' and the 'it' place to buy local souvenirs. I'm so glad she made this recommendation. Insa-dong is a large network of alleys of modern art galleries, tea houses, souvenir shops and arts and craft stores. The main street is a great place to start looking for mainstream souvenirs to take home such as Korean-style kitchenware, old traditional books and handmade paper, haboks (traditional Korean garments), dining utensils, figures, and all round handicrafts (magnets, purses, anything with the Korean flag on it). Traditional tea houses and authentic Korean restaurants are aplenty as you explore the alleys, and before you know it, you would have spent a good hour or two just easing in and out of every corner of Insa-dong.Loved the ambiance and it worth a visit if it is your first time in Seoul!"
120,5.0,"""If you're looking for some souveneirs for your loved ones & friends, insadong is a place to consider,there's a long lane of stores selling korean items/goods you can choose from & priced just right"""
121,5.0,"We were looking for a place where we can get cheap souvenirs to take home for our friends and my dear friend suggested Insadong. Its a very good thing that we went because not only were we able to buy cheap shirts (they gave it at 3shirts for 13000w) which is cheaper than the price in Myeongdong (5-7000w for one shirt). And thats nit the inky pleasant surprise because when we walked and kept looking for a place to eat, we chances upon this nice restaurant (i can not pronounce the name, just look at the pic) where we had one of the best meals we had in Seoul. Insadong should not be missed, not only for the souvenirs but also for are lovers because there are a lot of galleries exhibiting works of young Korean artists."
122,5.0,Insadong is a more tradition feel then the rest of Seoul. Shops are a lot of times in old Hanok (traditional Korean house) style buildings. This neighborhood is very photogenic with a whiff of history in the air. Traditional Korean snacks made by little old ladies are peddled in the streets here. Cafes and crafts rule this area without being outrageously overpriced. It can get crowded here but generally it clears out quickly. Insadong is very charming with a local old Seoul feel.
123,4.0,"Insadong is actually very touristy! That is reflected in three prices. However, if you come with limited time and you would like to get something considered typical Korean -> this is your place/ street/ area. Very crowded on weekends.Do not simply stick to the main street, rather stray a bit of into the little alleys left and right. Beautiful cafes and restaurants can be discovered there."
124,4.0,"Since I live near Seoul I go to this area very often with my family. Although nowadays it is losing its original identity and attractiveness little by little, it still is the place any foreign tourist should visit when in Seoul. There are many small galleries, hard-to-find gift shops, antique stores, old-fashion tea houses, and authentic Korean restaurants. During the weekend, there are many traditional Korean and Western performers to make your visit more enjoyable. Make sure to check out small shops hiding in the small alleys. Now you see more and more chain stores replacing old shops, but it still is a one of kind area in Seoul."
125,5.0,"We had a lot of fun shopping and sampling the street food, particularly the gyeranppang (egg bread), dbongbbang (poo bread), and the waffles."
126,4.0,"In Insadong we found shopping, restaurants and the kimchi museum! A must do. We also had fun visiting a temple and walking the streets. Seoul is more hilly then I expected so wear comfortable shoes."
127,5.0,"The wide, car-free street, awesome dumplings down a side ally (sorry, not sure how to describe location... Just ask) and lots of souviner shopping make it the perfect place for out if tien guests."
128,4.0,We went here to get some local souvenirs and found plenty with great bargain too. Not as many things to eat but they're different from your usual Korean food. Lots of weird stuff to eat and see too. Worth a trip away from the usual KR stuff.
129,5.0,This trendy neighborhood in Seoul  pays homage   to the past by its use of very old building exteriors that have been completely gutted and redone inside in  charming ways. Hanok alley is here and is full of trendy bars coffee shops and restaurants contained within an alley maze. The kimchi museum is here and there are several art galleries and musical instrument stores as well as artist supply stores. It's not far from one of the palaces and a university so the neighborhood has a very lively feel. It maybe too well discovered by now as it feels more touristy than it did last time I was here.
130,4.0,In Insadong there are a lot of shops. You can buy there good presents. You can find there many restaurants. Insadong'dan güzel hediyeler almak mümkün. Ayrıca çok lokanta ve mağaza bulabilirsiniz.
131,5.0,"Insadong is a great place to go if you want to see art and collectibles. There is paper art, pottery, masks, miniature collectibles and more. There are a few restaurants around as well. I recall stands selling fish cakes, dragon beard candy (which is cool to watch the process of it being made), Tteokbokki and more. There is a trick eye museum, a city escape activity, and a place that sells poop shaped snacks."
132,4.0,"This street is filled with souvenirs and all kind of local things. Either window shopping or buying things, visiting Insadong is a must. Don't forget to visit café or Ssamjigil while you are in Insadong."
133,5.0,"If you're the type who's in for a good bargain, from fashion to goods of tradition, make sure to visit this street!"
134,5.0,Insadong is a great sight for family shopping. All kinds of economy price products and foods. Lively shopping streets! Many tea cafes to take a rest and observe beautiful local culture of modern Korea. You can start shopping from 10 am until 10 pm.
135,4.0,"Insadong was the first place we visited in Seoul. We liked the old style neighborhood. One main street with lots of foot traffic and small stores, back alleys, small restaurants and charm. Insadong is more authentic and traditional than many other parts of Seoul. It's small and one probably doesn't need to spend more than a few hours there to get a feel for it. But compared to Myung-dong, Apkujung-dong there's more character to the neighborhood. It's also easier to spell...Nice tea shops, arts and crafts, souvenir shops. In the back alleys there are traditional restaurants."
136,5.0,"Nice arty shops along with souvenirs, and some local fashion - wide boulevard pedestrian areas, easy to get to."
137,4.0,it's fun to buy souvenirs here as you can see unique items from cheap to expensive ones. you can also bargain depending on the number of items you will buy from one stall
138,5.0,"We had great fun watching the honey candy being made into 16,000 strings (Dragon's Beard), and the candy-makers are so hilarious.  It takes less than a minute for the candy string to reach over 16,000 strands, so be sure to watch it.  The candy is really delicious with a nut filling wrapped inside. Isadong has lots of little shops and stalls, and we had the best lunch there as well as a memorable time watching the candy being made, and bringing some home.  The photo that I included is of the hilarious candymaker who asked where we were from, then told us facts about each of our cities (San Diego, Seattle)."
139,4.0,"This place was near to Bukchon and as usual, all the beauty shops were also all around the area. Somewhat similar to the other shopping districts so it did not make much difference to me. I felt that it was less crowded in Insadong so there was less hassle."
140,5.0,"Trendy, smart, young. Explore  Insadon alleys and you will find great cafes , antiques and hip coffee culture everywhere. Interesting renovations of old houses made into cool designer shops next to noodle shops with lines of young beautiful people waiting for a bowl. Take a afternoon and explore!"
141,5.0,Best area to find cheap but excellent qualitysouvenir items. Each stalll has different items to offer so better not stick to 1 store only.
142,4.0,"There are many traditional activities that you can partake in Insadong, like korean craft making, kimchi museum and traditional tea tasting and also lots of traditional snacks.A lot of the food items here are handmade compared to those in other areas which are usually already in packets."
143,5.0,The best place to find unique souvenirs in reasonable price. Somehow the souvenir sold here isn't sold anywhere else.
144,3.0,"Insadong is a hyped up shopping district, no thanks to those Korean tv shows like Running Man.  In reality, its really an ordinary looking place with its various shops selling antiques or quirky curios. The street performances light up the atmosphere occasionally, but this is not a must-go if you are tied for time."
145,3.0,"Insadong is closed off to traffic on Sat (2pm-10pm) and Sun (10am-10pm).On the Sat we visited, we saw a protest group saying no to dog meat trade.  Interesting!There were also a few performances, and I especially enjoyed the one by college students (farmer’s music and dance) at the end of Insadong-gil (near Tapgol Park).As I am not an artsy type, I didn’t spend much time browsing the galleries and souvenir shops.  Had planned to spend a couple of hours.  But left pretty soon as one souvenir shop is almost the same as another.Went on to Hongdae which I found has better vibe."
146,3.0,"Came here on our first day of arrival, fascinated by its creativeness amidst the tradition and modernisation. Absolutely a good start for our exploration in Seoul. 3500 won ice cream was one of the best here!"
147,5.0,A lot of Art on this street and have many restaurants that you must taste if you come here its call Mundoo (만두).
148,4.0,We found a few unique shops here but the majority of things could be found elsewhere cheaper. Poop Cafe was cute with the top level having discs with devotions of love written out and tied to the railings.
149,5.0,Insadong is the place to go to get all of your Korean souvenirs. They have tons of deals and offer inexpensive Korean made souvenirs for anyone to take home. Make sure you walk down all the side streets to see what they have to offer.
150,4.0,This place is one of the places you should visit if you want to buy lots of souvenirs. They have a lot of options and they’re sold at a cheaper price compared to Myeongdong.  They also have a lot of nice restaurants in here.
151,4.0,Nice place to stroll through and browse different shops and experience different tastes. Nice and relaxed and usually not too busy !
152,3.0,"I come to Korea to enjoy the local culture, not western culture. therefore this is really a place not for me, a short term visitor. However I would presume there are more expats over here than anywhere else in Seoul. I agree people here speaks better English than other parts of Seoul."
153,4.0,Would totally visit and explore this place again in my next trip to seoul. So many unique stores and souvenirs to see. Loved the atmosphere of this area.
154,5.0,"Small narrow maze-like streets, full of old houses and beautiful stores selling handmade accessories and many quality products (bought gifts for friends here). Food sold was great and I enjoyed dumplings and gelato. Oh, coffee was very good too (seems qualified barista working in this area)"
155,4.0,A shopping haven for those intending to buy souvenirs. Shop around first before buying as it is cheaper when you are deeper in the alleys than outside.
156,4.0,We came on a Monsay at about lunch time and we didnt expect a traditional marching band was performing because it was a week day. We were just lucky enough that we were there at the right time and got to witness it.
157,5.0,"We found this area on our first day, it was fantastic, packed with little specialist shops, hand made crafts and all sorts of interesting things to look at. Loads of restaurants of all sorts. Check out the tourist information where they have a place to try on traditional Hanbok outfits for a nominal fee, they will even take photos for you."
158,3.0,"We were there especially for a cat cafe, other than that too touristy for me. Too many people and shops sell traditional souveniers which we were not interested in buying"
159,5.0,"Great place to buy original korean made items, we bought our cortile bags here, can't be found anywhere else"
160,5.0,"I love insadong! You can find any traditional stuff here. Nice shops, nice food! Very crowded during weekends. If you prefer a quiet enjoyment, visit during weekdays. However, traditional street performance only happens during weekends."
161,2.0,"We visited on Sunday as the Main Street is block. It was supposed to have singing, dancing on the street. We were there in the morning at 10 am. No activities going on in the street. There were not many people walking either. Nothing exciting accept the stalls sell different things compare to down town Seoul."
162,3.0,"This art strip offers reletively good eats easy on the pocket. To look out for is the small kimbap eatery and the dimsum place tucked in a small alley.must try here are their beef balls and leek dimsum. Souvenirs are priced well but not as cheap as in Itaewon.Lining the streets are RTW shop of local designers as well as art galleries featuring local artists. You can also score traditional/ Buddhist artifacts here. But as far as authenticity is concerned, I've no idea.Overall, Insadong should be part of a first-timer's itinerary in Seoul."
163,5.0,"Souvenirs in the thousands at reasonable prices in any shape and size, Lovely shopping and dining area with tea houses and bordered by a palace and Buddhist temple"
164,4.0,"It is a pedestrian strip with shops selling souvenirs and some traditional Korean products only. However, there are alleys / side streets with many authentic Korean restaurants. some with many years history worth visiting."
165,4.0,"This shopping area is older when compared to Myeodong district. However, there are still plenty of things with reasonable prices to bargain for."
166,5.0,"Im really glad that our Tour Specialist brought us here though its not part of our itinerary. I would have missed hanjeongsik lunch and other stuff that can be bought here at a cheaper price compared to myeondong though i didnt check out the cosmetics shop (if there was any). If you would prefer more food trip and shopping, this place is highly recommended. Too bad didnt get to stay longer due to time constraints."
167,3.0,"The street is lined with shops selling crafts, souvenirs, cafes.  Pleasant place to spend time at (abt 1-2 hrs).  There is poo poo land and poo- related cafes and snacks for those interested.  Easy reach with subway (anguk station).  Not a big area, but it's close (walking distance) to Bukchon. Hanok Village and Samcheong-do, another two tourist attractions."
168,3.0,"suitable for those who wants to buy decorations, souvenirs and art. I am not much of a souvenir person so Insadong wasn't that interesting for me. There was not much clothing stores to shop. Unfortunately there was not much restaurant open when we were there because it was Chuseok. Still the place was crowded."
169,5.0,"We fell in love with Insadong the moment we saw the street lined with amazing local art, quaint museums, hip fashion stores, beautiful tea houses, and traditional restaurants that gave you a feel of being transported to another time in Korea. The vibe too is amazing. It's fun, very eclectic, friendly and casual. Ssamzeigil, a mall along Insadong featuring a pretty unique open layout design, features shopping for every age with different price range. There's something for everyone here, and even if you're just there to feel the vibe, it's definitely worth the visit."
170,5.0,"There are so many Korean food and interesting small performances like making king’s dessert which was really good. Especially with tea,would be betterFor meals and souvenirs,I recommend this place"
171,4.0,"We went here to buy souvenirs like shirts, fans, and ref magnets. They sell quality items at a cheaper price. They also give free items when you buy a lot. What I liked about Insadong is that it's not very crowded when we went there and it's clean."
172,4.0,"Tis is a beautiful and safe shopping area. We discovered wildly varying prices for the same items, so shop around and THEN buy. Carry cash because not all places take cards."
173,4.0,Very cool location to palaces city hall and markets. Many interesting restaurants and shops with local flavour. All of th above are within a reasonable walking distance but thee is good access to the great subway system to be able to visit other parts of Seoul.
174,4.0,Get the authentic Korean feel here in Insadong. Lots of restaurants and cute small shops in the small alleys. Try some Korean dumpings or noodles to end your perfect afternoon stroll.
175,4.0,"This place is full of shopping and food shops. there are also many side vendors selling everything from electronic fans, to ice cream and oreo filled pastries with honey."
176,4.0,Very pretty area with excellent restaurants.  I got a feeling though that they may have different prices for tourists versus locals.  I only bought from those whose prices are written on signs so that I know for sure that they are not changed because I was a tourist
177,5.0,"Said to be the cultural place of Seoul. This place is the best place to visit during the weekend. One is able to see some old Korean traditions. Street foods are available. If you are lucky, you are also able to see the cultural show on the stress."
178,4.0,"My family stay in Insadong over night so that we can go to Gyeongbukgun the next day. It turn out that we made the right decision. The street was clean and full of shops and restaurants and well within walking distance to the palace.  We were a bit surprised to see how few street food/night market type eateries there were, however. It wasn't a big deal given how many restaurants there were. Note: almost all the restaurants were Korean. My kids were asking for pasta, but couldn't find any...  Will definitely go back again to experience a different season/scenery."
179,4.0,"We must have spent at least about an entire day here. This area has a lot of shops which are mostly geared towards tourists and general shoppers. You can find all kinds of stuff here from local paintings to jewelry, clothing, antiques and of course small souvenir shops. My favorite here was the food. They have a variety of restaurants and you actually do see a lot of locals eat here. Their food is really good. We tried traditional Korean food here which was good. At the restaurant we went the food was really good but the attitude of the owner and the servers was not very good. The owner of this restaurant did not speak English very well and she was also very abrasive. She did not like people waiting inside the restaurant and instead of politely asking guests to wait outside she would plainly point guests to outside and say outside. My wife has food allergies to soy and Gluten and was asking the server if any of their meals has no soy and is gluten-free and that did not go well. The server first took order from three of us and finally when my wife was asking a few questions the server did not wait to take her order and walked away to greet other guests and never came back and placed the order for three of us with the kitchen and never came back to take my wife's order. My daughters and I ended up eating here and my wife went to another restaurant to get served. When food was brought to table there was no chop sticks and we waited around for at least 15 minutes and finally I got up and went up to the server and asked can we have chop sticks to eat and the server pointed to a small drawer under the table which had all the chop sticks inside and we ended up eating our food a bit cold. Remember couple of things at least from what we have seen, one most Korean restaurants have their chop sticks hidden in a drawer under the table and also you always pay on the way out at the cash register and normally they don't collect payment at the table."
180,5.0,We visited here to get some good food and buy some great souvenirs.  This place is clean and service around this place is great.  It is little touristy but it's worth it.
181,5.0,"The real traditional Seoul culture. You could spend hours or days just wandering the alleys and streets of Insadong and see traditional art, paper, calligraphy and culture."
182,5.0,"We stayed in Insadong and found it was the best location to walk to attractions plus it was the best neighbourhood for food, souvenirs and handmade handicrafts. Food ranged from restaurants to street stalls - the best! I would highly recommend anyone to stay here - we stayed at the Orakai Suites - fabulous!"
183,5.0,"Lots of shops and art galleries. Higher quality stuff than other shopping streets and more handmade art, etc. Beautiful setting and people watching as well."
184,3.0,"If you are the kind of person who loves to buy "" souvenirs"" and some things from the place, this is the place to go.The street is picturesque and you could find many ""celadons"" and little things to  buy. A place  where one could spend one or two hours."
185,4.0,Found this area much better for shopping then Myeongdong.  More traditional goods and so may great little places to eat.
186,5.0,"Lots of things to see and buy. Mostly frequented by tourist but just the same, some prices here are cheap if you are able to compare to some areas if not cheap, just the same"
187,5.0,Sick of cheap crap or expensive shops you get in every city? Then Insadong is perfect for you. Lots of artist shops and stores with quality good as well as your ubiquitous tourist shops and excellent restaurants. It is our favourite shopping area in Seoul. It remains me of Portland with small shops selling select items. Fun to wander through.
188,5.0,"i love the teahouses and small restaurants in the alley ! very cultural place to visit...recommended !! must walk into those alleys to find those traditional teahouses & guaranteed you would feel so different , away from the bustle of the main street !"
189,4.0,"After visiting the palace, we used Google map to guide us to Insadong. You can also print out a map before your trip if you prefer something bigger than a phone. :)The walk was about 15 minutes at most. There is a tourist booth with college students to answer any questions. We walked down the street on one side and walked up on the other side so we won't miss anything. There are many souvenir shops which was something we were not able to find in Myeongdong or Dongdamaen. The prices are more or less all the same, I know because I went in every shop to compare prices lol, for the same keychains, small hand crafted coin purses, bookmarks, and letter openers. The price difference is so minute it's not worth your time comparing. I did try to bargain at the few stores I made purchases from, and was successful. The discounts were small but better than nothing. :) Many restaurants or snack shops , tea houses, pharmacies, arts and crafts stores. It was not as crowded, a nice little break from all the sightseeing and shopping. Get a drink or popsicle, sit down on the bench and enjoy !"
190,5.0,It's a nice place with quaint shops where you can buy Korean products. Nice strolling around the area and watching how Dragon beard is made
191,4.0,It's a mix between modern and old.  The side streets and steps are great to explore while the Main Street has a mix of modern and old.  Great place to eat and the metro stop is right there it's worth a few hours or more to explore
192,5.0,I would like to walk around for shopping. You can find many great stuffs here. There are so many restaurants hid inside ally. Don'ts forget stop at lovely tea cafes.
193,5.0,Insadong is a mixture of old and new. It is a charming street including the many side allleys which can have cafes and boutiques side by side. There are shops which can rent out hanboks and also those which sell clothings with contemporary designs. The many art galleries make this place a must for those interested in paintings.There are many shops selling souvenirs and silver accessories. There were many designs which I didn't see in other places like myeondong or express bus terminal.Insadong is worth taking the time to stroll along and enjoy the sights and sound of old and new korea.
194,5.0,"If you can only go to one market this is it! We actually went twice we loved it so much. Fun people, great shopping , great food. It was wonderful"

196,3.0,"When you are looking for a nice place to buy korean souvenirs go to insadong.Try also the poop waffle like bread, its very chewy and not sweet. A lot of souvenir items can be bought to this place you can spend 1 hour to 2 hours max at this place"
197,3.0,"If you're looking into the different arts and crafts, you can find it here! - I had my 'dojang' or korean seal made here. It's 30,000 KRW but it's definitely worth it! I made them write both my korean and english name in the seal. You can also get it 15 minutes after having it personalized. - In the insadong street, you can find different stores with korea items you can bring home to your families.- There are restaurants but they are quite expensive, so make sure you find one that fits your budget!- There are girls who roam around wearing the hanbok or the traditional korean dresses, which YOU can also rent and wear around!- highly accessible to 2 main streets!- there are smaller streets you can go into that have different stores (restaurants, pot/ceramic stores, wood stores etc.) that you can go around to."
198,5.0,"This place is pretty interesting as there are plenty of souvenir shops and also modernised hanbok dresses for sale. And not forgetting hanbok rentals. There are plenty of cosmetic shops too and also there is an interesting shop that sells korean handmade scrubs. This shop also sells cute nut crackers and are not very expensive as souvenirs. Its really near where we rented our airbnb stay, probably 6 or 7 minutes away."
199,3.0,"Crowded, lots of street vendors. From Korean fashion to antiques. Had difficulty finding a public restroom."
200,4.0,"Primarily an arts and crafts street but with multiple shops selling the same thing or offering the same service. However, there is a hidden awesome bingsu shop in this street."
201,5.0,"Having been both an artist community and market for centuries, Insadong is a must see in Seoul.  There are many shops with hand made crafts of different varieties, as well as tea shops, clothing shops, stamp shops, simply lots and lots of shops. My son found works of art to bring home with him, I found souvenirs for my friends and there were many more options. In many of the small shops, you can look inside and see the proprietor working on a piece of art. I do wish I had more time to shop for clothes; the clothes shops were enticing. The restaurants in Insadong are less expensive than some other areas of Seoul and the food leans toward locally owned Korean tea houses and noodle shops. Another plus in my opinion. Don's miss spending at least a little time in Insadong. Do check out the side streets as well as the main pedestrian street."
202,4.0,"We spent an afternoon wandering the shops in the insadong markets. A good mix of ""real"" shops and tourist shops. Good souvenirs and house wares can be found, along with ornaments and many others things you can take home.There are street food stalls, but I wouldn't say the good is the main attraction here."
203,2.0,Not sure why people who come to Korea will go to this international town. It's basically the same food that you will get in Europe or US for a lesser price. Better off eating Korean food than the expensive food here.
204,4.0,Insadong-samcheongdong-gyeongbok palace-gwanghwamun can be grouped together. They are all walking distance from each other.
205,5.0,"I LOVE INSADONG. Heralded as the Art Capital of Seoul, this area is probably my favorite landmark out of all the places we visited last week. This area is quiet without being boring, and is lively without being rowdy. People aren't pushing you, and you don't feel any pressure to buy anything. Walk around and simply enjoy the ambiance of this perfect mix of old and new. And it truly lives up to its name as the art capital, because there are art galleries, calligraphy shops, and other art supply stores EVERYWHERE. This is also a great place to buy souvenirs for friends and family, because they offer the same things as other highly commercialized places for cheaper prices. Street food is also great too! 1000-2000 won only!!! Must-visit is the Ssamziegil Mall, which is half mall half boutique stores. This place is a HAVEN for Instagrammers, millennials, and anyone generally looking for something interesting in Seoul. (Tip: The infamous Poop Cafe is here, as well as the Wall of Love in the top floor) Other things worth getting here are the 16,000 strings of honey wrapped around ground nuts like mochi cakes (we bought our box from 2 very entertaining brothers!!!), and art supply materials if you're into painting and calligraphy."
206,4.0,"It's a great place to get souvenirs for friends and family. There are lots of little shops along the way that will sell keychains, bookmarks and Korean style chopsticks etc. Do visit the little alleyways by the main street, there are locals restaurants and traditional teahouses hidden in there. Have a cup of tea and a traditional Korean snack in the teahouses before you leave."
207,4.0,"Discover many things are cheaper here, compared to Myeong dong. Quite enjoyable.  I have green tea ice cream at a famous green tea shop there."
208,5.0,"having my korean mother and family living in seoul, i love to stroll in insadong and buy souvenirs, traditional korean paper  items and seal with name (you choose the stone and they engrave your name on it straight away). As i understood, Koreans do not have the notion of touristy. For instance, my korean mother was scared in Venice when we went for a stroll and there were so few tourists on the street ! As an industrialized country and OECD member, prices are in Korea (and in Seoul) generally very similar at the level in Europe !"
209,4.0,European style shopping area with lot of designer stores . Nice walk as well. Good place to stroll and do some shopping

212,4.0,"A simple and short street with traditional and non-traditional handicrafts, cafes, and snacks. Traditional costumes can be rented here as well and is within walking distance to the grand palace. Nice place to chill away a couple of hours."
213,5.0,good place to go and experience some tradition stuffs and can also try wearing tradition Korean dress hangbok.
214,4.0,"Insadong is not only a street but an entire area with many interesting places to visit. Primarily a shopping area with many many modern and traditional shops where you can find everything, from the last fashion to beautiful Korean ceramics. You can also see all the people around, particularly in a week-end when a lot of Koreans go to the area for shopping and have fun. A part or the shops there are many art galleries, all of the presenting outstanding artworks in very stylish buildings; and several restaurants where you can eat all kind of food at different prices. Not to miss if you visit Seoul."
215,4.0,"Everytime when in Seoul, we will visit this place (Insadong), like it because is nice, with shops and café, we always visit Innis Free café."
216,5.0,This street if filled with old traditional Korean items that's just perfect for souvenirs and gifts to bring back home. Many items are over priced and there's no bargaining but it's still very fun to walk through. I especially like the old book store where you'll find many candies and toys from back in the day--70's and 80's. The street food here is pretty tasty as well and cheap!
217,5.0,"Consisting of a main street with several side alleys, this area has a good vibe.  Lots of  art galleries, shops selling lovely paintings, pottery, and other korean items.  Plenty of restaurants and cafes too. Easy to reach by metro, get off at Anguk Station and its right there."
218,1.0,"We've been here a couple of times before to the main shopping strip and been unimpressed both times. Store staff are pushy and goods are way overpriced. It's crowded on any day. It's saving grace is it's close proximity to Bukchon village, Myeongdong and palaces."
219,4.0,We walked around through a lot of shops and street vendors prior to attending the Buddha festival. The kids enjoyed it and so did we.
220,4.0,This is a street  that sells  just about anything and everything.Interesting  walk along this  street with all kinds  of  street food and also can watch the stalls  making the dragon beard candy
221,3.0,"I was not impressed with Insadong.  At first, I taught this is a great place to stroll, but my expectations was wrong.  Although there are a lot of goof cafe's and hidden restaurants, the place lacks interesting things that would appeal to a variety of interest."
222,4.0,"I grew up in Korea in 60's and early 70's.The street vendors reminds of my good old days eating very traditional sweet and laying games, but never wore Korean dresses. Nowadays so many young people rent out the Korean traditional dresses ($10+) and walked around the Insadong very impressive and beautiful. Long walk checking around old houses village  and shipping area."
223,5.0,"Insadong is the perfect place to look for souvenirs to bring back home as well as for arts and crafty things. You can also find hanbok rental shops here, which costs four times cheaper than the hanbok rentals near the Gyeongbokgung palace. For Muslim travellers, there are a couple of halal Indian restaurants in this area."
224,5.0,"This is the best place to find souvenirs from Korea! This place is cute and happy, and fun to window shop in!"
225,4.0,Everyone visiting Seoul should take sometime to stroll through Insadong. Many of the merchandise here are local made & you can pick up nice gifts or souvenirs in the many shops here. Enjoy the walk and if you can also rent a hanbok to wear.  The atmosphere is nice specially in spring time when the air is cool and fresh.
226,5.0,i prefer this street / area compare to Myeongdong street.i still can found some herritage building in this area.
227,5.0,"Insadong is a great place to stroll around and explore paintings, souvenir and eat some great food like the poo cake that you can sample right at the entrance. The basement offers another hidden away gem though. A big room with different craft workshops (making leather bracelets, knotting bracelets, nail art (creating a pictures with nails and string), and designing pots, plates and other pottery or designing Russian matrooshkas. You have to pay for it (around 15-25 Euros depending on what you want to do) but it's worth it, both of our kis kept wanting to go back (my daughter actually did 3 nail art pictures. The staff speaks English and will happily take the kids for a couple of hours. So you can enjoy Insadong and look at the cute artsy shops in the mall or enjoy tea or green tea icecream on main street."
228,5.0,This charming area in the middle of Seoul has kept some of its old world village ambience. If you visit on a weekend you will be sure to see young Koreans dressed in the traditional Hanbok clothes. Great place to pick up some crockery and souvenirs.
229,4.0,We went here during our last day in Seoul. It has a lot of restaurants to choose from and a lot of souvenir shops also.
230,4.0,Many souvenirs and arts stores along the whole Main Street. Famous for the Poo pancakes and toilet cafe. On one of the side street we found a good Korean restaurant with nice hot stone bibimbap.
231,4.0,"Great walk around the area, best linked with a visit to GyeongBuk Palace and the King Square as they are all within a good walking distance with great transport links to Dongadaemon after insadong (if your legs can cope!), if interested I hopped on bus 7205 - approx 6 stops and your Dongdaemun. Shoutout to the tourist information centre .Area is crafty and mainly for souvenir shopping. Possibly good photos along some of the alleyways .Not so great for shopping, as most shops sell the same thing, and noticed some of the items are over priced compared to other areas.But def worth a visit if you link up a cultural day around Seoul!"
232,5.0,"Loved browsing the shops, very inexpensive with great variety. not too expensive even though it is aimed at tourists."
233,5.0,This place is great if you want to buy gift to take home best prices and the store owners are nice and some of tgem give you a gift after you buy from them. We also found an awesome restaurant were you can actually sit on the floor and eat plus it was $20 for the three of us and it was a lot of food.
234,5.0,"Beautiful historical place.Best antiques, artwork and souvenirs shopping place.Really amazing, one of my favorite shopping places.Visited in Summer of 2015"
235,5.0,"If you want find and feel the Korean culture and souvenirs, you must visit this place. Really they have tons of traditional souvenirs with a reasonable prices. While you're walking down the the street, easily you will find very traditional performances to look and participate with. Why not, the typical gourmets also!"
236,4.0,"If you're a collector, this place may be suitable for you..there were really great handmade crafts for you to buy...i was there to just walk around and had a cup of tea and bingsu.."
237,5.0,"Remarkably well priced goods and restaurants for an essentially tourist strip. Plenty of art galleries and stylish clothing and jewellery. Plenty of restaurants and casual eateries, with emphasis on Korean food. We stayed at Oralia Suites, which was briallantly located to explore this suburb and nearby attractions."
238,5.0,I guess i found here the tastiest food and budget friendly in Seoul. The food is very authentic which I and my parents love most too.
239,4.0,"Even on a cold February day the streets were crowded and the smells intense!  Many many small eateries and one aisle shops.  The shopkeepers are many and try to entice you, but they are polite in their efforts.  Be careful...there are cars and motorcycles/scooters on these streets!"
240,3.0,expected more as most of the stuff they sell is mostly junky clothes from China and things you probably won't buy
241,4.0,"I enjoyed Insadong more than Myeongdong as the goodies were more diverse. Myeongdong is mostly cosmetics, clothes, and food. Insadong had arts, handcrafts, and lots of knick knacks. We walked its whole length, and went all the way to the Myeongdong Cathedral, and was able to compare both sites in one day. I wouldn't say prefer one over the other, its more like, visit both. Highly recommended!"
242,5.0,This is a great spot to pick up souviners for the family and to try some local street food. Insadong is really close to the Anguk subway station so the location couldn't be better. Plus it's also in the heart of Seoul.
243,5.0,Loveee this place. Its a good place to shop for souvenirs. You need to bargain tho. Dont forget to bargain.
244,3.0,"This is a touristy street known for selling arts and crafts, antiques and souvenirs.We got here around 7pm and many of the shops were closed already.Most of the small and interesting  Korean restaurants are located in the side street."
245,4.0,"At here you can buy souvenir cheaper, variety beg only 10,000 won each, handcraft, your own stamping name in korea 15,000, local dessert. Please try the squid bbq, 😋"
246,4.0,"This little suburb is full of traditional Korean souvenirs and shopping items. There are many traditional activities to see on the weekend, like rice cake making. With many restaurants and many snack stalls (particularly poo bread (sweet bun in a shape of poo), it is a fun place to visit!"
247,5.0,Insadong is the place to go if you want to buy Korean sweets as souvenirs. It is a long stretch of shops. Look out for a shop that sells korean cotton sweet.  It's not cotton candy but some sort of cotton sweet.  It's white in colour.  The price is about 7000 won per box. We bought 7 boxes and no regrets buying them! It's really good. You should buy the seaweed too. Very tasty. There is also a fancy shop that sells tea. The price is actually quite reasonable.  They also sell chocolates. Overall a good place to buy korean sweets.
248,3.0,"This place is very near Anguk station. Quite touristy. You can get lots of tourist trinkets and gifts here. But beware, many are made in China. I read about pottery, and ceramics in this cultural zone but was quite disappointed to see many were made in China too. Of course, there's still some Korean products, but just be careful to check. Some of the items are quite pricey, so check a couple of shops if you want to buy. I bought a wooden spoon from an old lady for ₩1000 but one of the street carts was selling it for ₩2500! There are many eateries and restaurants in the area. You will be spoilt for choice. Check out the alleyways as they have many interesting shops or eateries too. We went to some galleries which we chanced upon and had fun looking around. We also found a Korean dumpling shop which was crowded with locals. Turned out to be a popular North Korean style dumpling which had been in business for decades. Not bad. It's a place for both young and old as there are some newer shops and cafes that attract youngsters. Nice to spend an afternoon here."
249,4.0,"Lots of local shops selling modern fashions and cosmetics, with plently of Korean restaurants interspersed. Best to go after 16:00 as then the outside foid vendors appear and it is amazing to go from one to another tasting the various fare."
250,5.0,"this is the place where you can look for a nice affordable BBQ, you can also have a walk around the street to sightseeing"
251,5.0,"Insadong has markets and you can walk along the individual shops that you could find really nice souvenirs for your friends and family. We dropped by the most famous stamping and calligraphy shop that had been visited by Obama, Queen Elizabeth, and all others. I almost got one of it myself but was quite costly to me. So, we decided to go on our walk. Relaxing and many little handicraft to look at. There's an art center and you could find really nice crafted mother of pearl souvenir for friends and family. Mostly, key chains and local made either on the street or in the shop. Flowers really beautiful and handkerchief truly nicely made. Hand soup with decent scents and arts stuff. Don't forget to try the Dragon Beard Candy of Korea! This is totally different taste from others! The owner can speak a little of all languages and they will demonstrate how they do it. Well, if you have tasted Chinese / China Dragon Beard Candy, go for this one and you will taste the different! I love it!Get more time here to explore as we were just popping by before our next itin bring us to!Enjoy another market visit with trends, local feel, art sense and eating little food."
252,5.0,"For walking around, eating, shopping, this is a great neighborhood. We've purchased  celadon ceramics, books, Korean crafts here. Close to Jogyesa temple, Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon Village, Jongno Tower, it has a neighborhood feel. Great restaurants."
253,4.0,Insadong is the prefect place to go shopping for souvenirs! The place is also filled with good street food and restaurants
254,3.0,"Place to visit to get souvenir, mostly selling same items with some restaurants. Price almost the same as well. We were there during winter and shops closed mostly around 8pm by 9pm only cafe and restaurants are open. So if you want to shop, suggest that you shop first and eat later."
255,5.0,"A place to shop for souvenirs, do compare the price and you might get a great deal. Some nice street food but it’s not cheap. Beautiful ginkgo tree along the road. Unique and pleasant visit."
256,5.0,"the experience to walk in this district was amazing. you feel to be in a warm place, not only arrnaged for tourism."
257,5.0,"We are very familiar with all of Seoul, yet we always go to Insadong to eat at least a few times while we are there for a week.  The back alleys of Insadong have wonderful ""hole in the Wall"" type of restaurants with authentic and delicious Korean foods!  We are always taken to these restaurants by Seoul residents so I afraid I am unable to give directions or even names.  Just get off the main street and explore the alleys and try any restaurant that have lots of people inside.  Don't forget the second floor restaurants too.  Tea rooms will most always be on the upper floors so look up and see where it looks crowded."
258,3.0,"If you have never been to street market, this is probably a good place to start. Street market in Asia is super crowded and Insadong is definitely much less crowded. It's a good place to take a stroll while enjoying a little shopping and street food. But there is also restaurants to eat a full meal.Its a great place to grab Korean souvenirs: Hanbok, eating utensils, pottery. There is a mix of modern shops as well and Korea's many cosmetic brands can also be found. Pro: Less crowded, makes it easier to shop in peace. Cons: Communication can be hard as not a lot of shop owners can speak English. Not all Korean cosmetic brand is available."
259,5.0,"Our hotel was right by Insadong. We had so much fun taking daily trips to the market for dessert and shopping. My daughter had a fun time in the market with my husband. She enjoyed eating the ""j-cones"" of ice cream that they sell and looking for a new hanbok and souvenirs for her friends."
260,4.0,"A nice outdoor market area to visit if one wishes to buy Korean traditional crafts as gifts for family and friends. Some interesting street food stalls and restaurants around the area, good for visitors to recharge before resuming their shopping."
261,5.0,"Comparing with Myeong -dong, it has less jam of people traffics and noise, but with more shops for design, accessories, antique, and local feast of dinning. You could not find those skin care shops as flooded in Myeong -dong, and shop owners also seemed more relaxed, polite, even you just looked and went away. The street is not long, but just for pedestrians, safe and calm. If you visited pearl and jewellery city, just spend you 15 minutes walk from it, and surprised you with a relaxed atmosphere."
262,4.0,"Stayed in a hotel nearby, and enjoyed this area since there are many good local restaurants and plenty of souvenir shops. Good for family travel"
263,4.0,look no further than to this place to look for cheap and nice souvenirs to buy. There are lots of restaurants and shops with good food too
264,4.0,Lots of stores to choose from and restaurants to eat. Although it is quite hard to look for a comfort room/toilet. However you may enter some shopping establishments to use their restrooms.
265,2.0,"I was quite bored in Insadong. Not much to see, and the souvenirs most stalls are selling are more or less the same. There was a building which supposedly have more interesting items and locals crafts, but it failed to intrigue. I feel that if you don't have much time in Seoul, this is one street that you can skip. Perhaps I haven't read up sufficiently on the interesting thing in this street..."
266,3.0,"Insadong is an area where there are lots of places to pick up souvenirs.  There are some restaurants and clothing stores here as well.  We decided to come here out last night in Seoul to get some souvenirs before leaving.  However, buyer beware, there are a lot of stores selling the same items for different prices.  We discovered this about 10 stores apart, 2 were selling the exact same magnets, but at different prices.  Also, there are tonnes of beauty masque stores in Insadong.  Seems like almost every 5th store is. Same deals too.  Gets boring after a while.  We did discover a really good place to eat though.  It was located in a traditional looking building along the left side of the street.  Anyway, we spent a couple of hours here, this included dinner, in October 2016, and accomplished our goal and left for home."
267,4.0,"You can try out Korean tradtional costume or known as Hanbok. I tried it at Insadong Tourist Center. To go there, take subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) Exit No 6"
268,5.0,Invading is not as trendy or cool as the Myeongdong shopping street but there are plenty of interesting little restaurants and food carts to sample as well as a wide variety of stores to visit.  We stayed in Insadong and so had a number of opportunities to visit the area.
269,3.0,This street is okay...may be worth a miss to be honest. Some small artsy shops but nothing much else going for it. Quite short so not really worth going out of your way to get to.
270,5.0,You can find many interesting souvenirs here and many many local restaurants in every corners but dare not to try as they quite pricy and not sure Tried the dessert place called The Poop and it was great as its quirky Had dinner at the Korean dumpling noodle which very popular with the locals but not so good for our taste
271,4.0,"Strol along the fancy and hip shops and litle resraurants. Nice teahouses. It is an area with lots of young people.When you are done it is nice to walk to the river, they dug up the old hidden river and made it a vey pleasant walkway."
272,4.0,Insadong is very walkable and with many shops and restaurants.The shopping center Insadong Ssamzigi worth a visit.
273,4.0,"This street has lots of souvinear shops that have the same stuff, but also a lot of shops that have unique items. We picked up some standard souvinears as well as some different ones like a traditional korean stamp.  There were a lot of art shops here as well, but didn't find anything to our liking that was proceed right for us. Outside of the shops, there was a traditional korean dance near the entrance to the street.  We toured on a Saturday so not sure if that happens other days too. The kids enjoyed watching that and they even asked our youngest to go dance with them. She enjoyed that. The street food is also not to be missed. I had been hesitant to try it, but after trying the chicken ganjeoung, I was hooked. Looks spicy, but was not. We also tried the fish cake that the kids enjoyed. There was also a round pastry that tasted like funnel cake and was filled with a honey concoction that was excellent. Don't be afraid to try it while you are there."
274,5.0,"This has always been my favorite place in seoul. Its nice to walk around during the afternoon to browse the shops and try out the coffee shops in this area. Take time to explore the small alleyways too, some interesting restaurants are found there. There are also events during the weekends and street performers."
275,5.0,It's a nice place that you must visit if your I. Seoul. Nice art work handcraft all kind of traditional things and nice restaurants
276,4.0,A nice street with lesser crowd to visit with some unique shops unlike their more famous streets. Have plenty of food options too.
277,5.0,Love the traditional shops. Love all the food vendors. We had such a nice time there sampling all the foods! A must go and see for first timers! Lots and lots of shops! I'll be visiting there again soon!
278,5.0,"Shops closes as early @7pm(Seoul time). Additional given as a courtesy.  That's small gesture & greatly appreciated. Bought some handmade nuts snacks & they are really nice. Being the boss herself, she really does it from start to tending business,  cleaning up. A friendly lady who speaks basic English & Mandarin. Her enthusiasm is attractive. A very positive energy that makes her very approachable. A nice place for getting from souvenirs to beauty to your appetite. Walking distance from Myeongdong."
279,3.0,"Insadong is a market where you can buy lot of things mainly lokal art and handcraft's. It's a morse spectacular market than myengdong with plenty more thing's to buy and a different type of local food, try The dragonbeard it's a kind of bread that they are making to look like a beard and they wrap different types of nuts in, it's a nice things to try."
280,4.0,"There are a lot of pretty alleys that you can pop in for photo taking. But apart from that, there is nothing much to look forward to in insadong unless you like handicrafts."
281,5.0,"Avoid going there during weekends, too many people. Best time to go there is before afternoon during a week. There are lovely shops with the porcelain and Korean drawings and paintings. In the small streets there are lovely tea places and some very good restaurants. Home made dumplings: Gaeseong Traditional Dumplings House - traditional Korean excellent food! And cheap! Often there is a queue but fast sorted."
282,3.0,This area is a little bit crowded with some cloths shops and other stuff that you can find everywhere. It is not a must see area unless you have some spare time to spend.
283,5.0,"Insadong is one of the coolest if THE ooolest tourist traps I have ever seen.... The prices are reasonable (for a tourist trap) and the selection of souvenirs, etc is simply mind boggling....,"
284,4.0,"It's a short street, really, and all you can here is buy souvenirs. It's still worth going if it's your first time in Korea, though."
285,4.0,"The natives aren't too interested in this spot, but as a tourist, I love it.  I love the quaint old buildings, narrow old streets, and fun shops with a variety of goods, from cheap souvenirs to nicer art and handicrafts.  A great place for souvenirs, some good eats, and teahouses.  We were traveling with family native to Seoul who didn't want to spend that much time there.  I would have wanted to spend more time browsing the antique shops and old book shops."
286,4.0,"I always enjoy going to Insa-Dong for getting gifts for family and friends.  We have a few paintings and carvings from this area, and I got two more this time.   Many nice places to eat, and some hidden tea gardens that are super relaxing.  Definitely hit up Insa-Dong if you want to get some nice gifts, a good bite to eat, and chill out at a tea garden."
287,4.0,"Insadong is a place that at first may look a little similar to other places like Hongdae, Myeongdong or Itaewon, but walk a little further and you will realise that it has more to it than what you see in the eye at first.It is the area where there are quite a significant number of stores selling traditional Korean arts and crafts for souvenirs, such as fans and antiques. Sometimes, you might even find some unusual stuff that is unique to Korea there. It is a blend of both the old and new mixing well together in Insadong.There are also a few street stalls near the main alleys, which are slightly cheaper than those in Myeongdong. However, Insadong is the place for the more traditional kind of Korean cuisine, and many restaurants in the area often serve up this kind of cuisine. So it is a good place to try this if you are looking for something more authentic.What is a little more unexpected for me is that it is actually a great place for street photography, especially during weekends and holidays. As we happened to go down on a public holiday, many people came out to Insadong in Hanbok of different kinds. With the constantly moving crowds, there is definitely no shortage of subjects to shoot for street photography. Even the less crowded side alleys at great for photography too.There is a shopping mall of some sort called Ssamzigil in the middle of Insadong. For its design, it would be rather weird to call it a shopping mall but there doesn't seem to have any equivalent term to describe it. Many of the stores there deal with handicrafts and food mostly, but the top floors give a rather good top down view of the whole Insadong area.It is quite easy to get to Insadong by the Seoul Metro, as it is reachable through Jonggak Station, Jongno 3-ga Station and Anguk Station. Overall, it would take at least 2 hours or so just to walk around the whole of Insadong, and it is not too far from Myeongdong either too."
288,3.0,you can get some shirts and food and its not bad for a tourist area. it's not cheap but nice to walk around at in the evening.
289,5.0,If you want to buy souvenirs or traditional Korean items you should visit Insadong! It has many nice artsy cafes and restaurants. There is a building there dedicated to handmade products made in Korea.
290,4.0,This street is another shopping street in Seoul but you feel that you are in Korea. They have more interesting items including some traditional Korean ceramics or silver works. Cute street.
291,4.0,"Shopping district not too different to Myeongdong but but more traditional in terms of shopping for local crafts etc. Lots of coffee shops to stop in at, fun stalls on the pedestrian walking street and the usual Korean cosmetic shops. On weekends a lot of girls like to dress up in traditional hambok outfits to walk around which is nice to see. Near other tourist sights so worth a stroll but not a must-do."
292,4.0,We love the cat cafe here. The cats were very friendly and didn't mind a two year old. We also ate lunch here at a restaurant that was located down a set of stairs and it was a hidden gem! Don't be afraid to explore this area! People seem very friendly and helpful!
293,5.0,"This is more like shopping at melrose than shopping at the beverly center.  My daugther got a stamp made with her korean name on it; my mother-in-law bought a traditional korean fan; my boy bought some ""adventure time"" cartoon clothes patches.  We ate a cheap but good chinese restaurant here as well as a restaurant well known for great steamed korean ribs with cold korean noodle broth."
294,5.0,"We spent most of our time here if we weren't visiting other sites.Good culture place, took kimchi making lessons at kimchi-kan here, bought souvenirs here (note - some are even cheaper than in myeongdong!), good food :)"
