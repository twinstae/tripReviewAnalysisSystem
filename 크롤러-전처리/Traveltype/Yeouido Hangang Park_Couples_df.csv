At the park is a bike trail, running trail etc and one can rent bikes. there are also cafes and restaurants, so making it the perfect destination for an afternoon outdoors. It gets very crowded on weekends however the atmosphere is great."
1,5.0,"My boyfriend and I hired two shopper bikes in Yeouido park. We headed off along Mokpo bridge, along the other side of the river and back across Yanghwa bridge, then back down to the park along the under-road cycle highways. It was a fantastic experience and we really enjoyed the privacy of the cycle highways along with being able to test the outdoor gyms that were dotted along the route. The park itself is lovely apart from the hawkers...the old women shoving flyers for fried chicken in our faces...however you can avoid them once on the actual bikes. The rental was cheap and the bikes worked, that is all I can ask for."

3,5.0,"Yeouido Hanggang park is one of the three popular Hangang parks along with Banpo and Jamsil. This park will be extremely crowded during the Spring Flowers Festival (early April, about 10 days) and the Firework Festival (September or October, but only a few days.) Other than that, it won't be crowded that much except weekends. Many locals bring a tent or a mat (there are many rental places too) to the park, and drink (yes, you can drink in public in Korea) and eat fried chickens (they deliver it to you) here. (The regulation about the tent and trash is recently tightened) But, please noted that it will be almost empty during Winter and extremely cold to be here.Visit Friday and Saturday nights(18~23), and try international cuisines from food trucks (called Toggaebi-Yasijang)  Toggaebi-yasijang won't open during Winter either."
4,5.0,We went for the cherry blossoms and enjoyed the festivities.  A good deal of effort went into making the event enjoyable for people of all ages and it seems like it would be a lovely area for a stroll at any time of year.
5,3.0,"Others claimed that this is the best park along Han River from my reading before we went to Seoul, but as we reached there, it is just a plain riverside with walkways..maybe we should try again in warmer months."
6,5.0,"We came here late, so, only had the chance to take a photo with the “I Seoul you” sign before needing to hop on the metro to meet a friend for dinner. It looks like a nice stroll along the water."
7,3.0,"We popped by Yeouido Hangang Park on a weekday afternon in November, hoping to hire bikes to go for a trundle. Unfortunately the bike rental places were closed despite us checking the opening hours before. With cold and grey weather we walked for a short while exploring the trails in the park but it wasn't that pleasant beacuse of the poor conditions. We spent some time watching the river before calling time and heading back to the Metro. I imagine it could be very lovely in full sun, but our experience was dissapointing."
8,3.0,"This is a place where the local youths hangout to eat, drink and chill out in general. We decided to come here to try the local fad - eating ramen noodles in the park.First you have to go to the very crowded convenience store to get your ramen. Next, cook your noodles. The store provides every amenity that you will need for a hot bowl of noodles. Lastly, find a spot amongst the very crowded waterfront to eat!This was a good experience to enjoy your food, people watch and seeing the world go by. However the crowds and noise will seriously turn you off.Granted, this is a public location and we came on a Saturday but it was a bit turn off.We also discovered to our amusement that there is a booth in the park. You can actually call to order food delivered to you and the delivery man will meet you at the booth.It was an interesting one time experience, however we will not probably come back here again."
9,4.0,"We went there for Cherry Blossom. It was pretty but there are other places in Seoul with better Cherry Blossom display. First of all, the place was way too busy even during a weekday. I recommend going to the Lotte World park to view the cherry bloosm"
10,4.0,"A lovely walk through to the river on a very, very cold wInter morning but really pleasant n the midst of a vast mega city."
11,5.0,Had a lovely time walking along the Han river in the sunshine. There are boat trips that leave from the area and you can also cycle along the paths (you can hire bikes too). We finished off our walk at the food court in the base of the Seoul 63 building since there aren't any places to eat on our stretch of the walk. It was quiet enough for our walk but I believe the park gets much busier in the late spring and autumn. We also went there for the International Fireworks festival and it was CRAZY busy! I imagine it will be the same in cherry blossom season...
12,5.0,"whether you like to walk, bike, skate, or run you can do all there here at the Hangang park. Amazing place to come with family or with friends. you can ride pedal boats or even have lunch or dinner in a boat. if you want to make things more romantic you can go on a dinner cruise on the Hangang. or if you just want to breathe in the fresh air and walk around you should make sure to visit the convenience store and get your self some ramen!!!"
13,4.0,"Its very large area for sightseeing, you should spend time more than 3 hrs with my map. Firstly, taking subway transportation to Yeouido station, heading to NorthWest and walk through Yeouido Park and taking photo with National Assembly. Turning back to Yeouido Hangang Park. After this route, I found the minimart(named Mini Stop) where the chicken shop is on 2nd floor. So nice and memorable nature treat in Seoul!"
14,5.0,"Singers, people and families all in one beautiful melting pot. View is awesome and I love just walking there while taking pictures and listening to the buskers"
15,4.0,"We stayed a week in Seoul and that day we felt like getting a bit away from all the action downtown. A quick subway ride brought us to this pleasant park right at the Han River. There are lots of locals, mostly school kids and students (at least on a weekday) roaming the area and not many tourists....which isn't a bad thing.This park has quite a nice setting with some good city views and lots of space to walk, bike or relax. A bit SEOUL sign at the river is the perfect photo op.There is a good number of small restaurants, mostly chicken & beer and a huge bike rental, if you feel like driving instead of walking, quite cheap even.If you are here in spring you might get lucky to see the cherry blossoms....we just missed by only a few days. Well, a good reason to go back I guess. After this park you should also check out the nearby Yeouido Park with some nice strolls (and more cherry blossoms in season).All in all a nice place to spend some time away from all the action.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
16,5.0,"It's a good place during April in Seoul because you can see whole park with cherries!Also a good place for dating and resting.You will not find very hot during April, and with all the trees covered."
17,5.0,Fortunately we came in April to witness the beauty of Cherry blossoms everywhere. This large park also gives a friendly vibe for friends and family day out. Worth to stop by while in the Seoul.
18,5.0,The park is very big and crowded during April. There are many cherry blossom and great view for taking photos. Took us some time to get out of the train station. Do come early and find a nice place for picnic.
19,4.0,"This park is worth a visit during Cherry Blossom season, especially during its spring festival. To reach this place, take the subway to National Assembly station, and exit from Exit 2. You need to take a 7-10 minute walk to get to the park. The place is crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike, but its draw is the rows of cherry blossom trees with the hangang river as the backdrop. Lovely place for photo taking and capturing the beautiful cherry blossom flowers. We had a nice and slow stroll along the park for a good 2-2.5 hours, during the Spring festival."
20,5.0,"Reached the park early in the morning ( to avoid the crowd)by taking a direct bus from Myeongdong. It was a beautiful sunny morning & the river breeze was so refreshing. Although the date of blossoming was last week, it is lucky to see most of the flowers were still intact ! Leisure walk along the river bank was relaxing & pleasant ,it's definitely an ideal place or picnic! Bicycle rental is available there as well! Recommended if you are visiting Seoul in spring ,just to have a leisure stroll ,have a break from the hustle & bustle of the city !"
21,5.0,"Leisure time in Seoul, Recommend place to Picnic with quite green place. Bicycle rental service is available."
22,3.0,"Nice for a picnic, or for your lunch break if you work in one of the skyscrapers nearby. Otherwise, there are some meadows, some trees, a river, a cafe, a small pagoda and so on- but nothing which is special to Korean culture. Nearby the river there are a few nice other spots, one can take a walk there. Even so it is not the ""cultural hotspot"", the area around the river and the park may be nice to play with your children, have a picnic and/or enjoy the relative calm there."
23,4.0,"We had a nice quiet  stroll in the morning to early afternoon here since our hotel check in is not until later on. Take a nice walk, enjoy the view, I recommended to visit this attraction only if you are staying in this area, otherwise it's not something you would travel far for."
24,5.0,I recommend this walk in the park after going to the 63 Building. Beautiful views to the beach. There are a couple restaurants over there ideal for a date.
25,4.0,"It was just coincident for me to visit there with my wife! But I experienced real korean culture! You know what? You can get delivery service there and can have it at the park on the bench or somewhere you can seat on! Plus Beer or Soju-Korean drinksAtmosphere was relaxing but exciting,too~ you can see many locals having fried chicken and beer or someone had black noodle.... I joined that one since our tour guide helped me to order fried chicken~It was good experience doing the same thing like localI recommend to do that at Hanriver park I mean ordering something!"
26,5.0,"Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed hanging in hangang park. The first day we went for a boat trip, it was nice but not a wow factor. Later we walked around the nightmarket and there is loads of food trucks with delicous food.The next day we rented bicycles, we rented two bicycles for two hours for 10 000 won, which I think is really cheap. A thumbs up is that you can hang out drinking alcohol and eating in this park.I wished we had a park like this at home.."
27,5.0,"During the Cherry Blossoms period, we took a public bus to the beginning of the Park where all the street food were. As we continued walking, we saw bigger Cherry Blossom trees, they were having a festival there too. The view was endless and amazing! Totally worth the walk!"
28,4.0,"We had only a few hours in Seoul before we had to catch a flight to Hong Kong.  Our hotel recommended we take a walk around the park.  It was nice to get out and get some fresh air before getting back on an airplane, we were flying for 2 days.  The cafe at the park entrance was opening and we wish we had time to sit down and enjoy a coffee and the view."
29,5.0,"Went there during the full bloom of cherry blossom. It was very crowded as people flocked to see the full bloom. However, the view was magnificent!"
30,5.0,"My fiancé and i rented a bicycle from Yeouido Park and we cycled all the way to Hangang Park from Yeouido park. One of the best decision made as we were able to enjoy the best of both parks. Rental of tandeum bicycle cost us about 6,000KRW for 1 hour, which we thought was quite reasonable. It's a huge and beautiful park."
31,4.0,"Visited this park with my boyfriend. We took a walk around the park and took some photos. We noticed a lot of couples and families walking around the park. It is very relaxing park with nice scenery. We enjoyed the scenery (but the weather is really cold). There are some cafes and convenient stores nearby where you can have a quick bite and some hot drinks. This park is located near Yeouinaru station (여의나루역), exit 2. Walk out of the station and the park is at the right hand side."
32,4.0,I like this park its very relaxing....It's perfect for couples a lot of Korean couples come here to walk especially in the spring and fall.
33,4.0,"Favourite spot for locals during weekend. Couples, families, friends  love the spot. Great view across the Hangang River"
34,5.0,"I was really blown away with Yeouido Park. It is in the heat of the financial district in Seoul, but don't let that dissuade you, it's wonderful."
35,4.0,You can easily spend a few hours walking along the Han river or hire a bike for a few hours and do a loop of the track :)
36,5.0,"This park is located on the south side of the Hangang river. It is a well maintained park with some kiosks for buying drinks or snacks. You can also opt for renting a bike at the park. Bikes are relatively small, but they work well in general. There's a biking trail in the park. But you can also leave the park and bike along the river Hangang. If you like biking and are a confident biker, this is what you should do in my opinion!There you'll find a nice walking and biking trail along the river. It's a great way to do some exercise and enjoy the views along the river. There are several resting areas and kiosks around. It can get very busy in the weekend. Enjoy!"
37,4.0,the garden of yeouido at hangang park is not as pretty as at yeouido park. I think better you visit the Yeouido garden than hangang park except you want to get a boat  tour.
38,2.0,"Went there at april to see sakuraThere nothing thereOnly a few tree with a little sakura thereDont go there if u want to see some cherry blossom treeOther than that, i think around april there always a festival there"
39,4.0,This is an area that has some really good views with the cherry blossom trees and its a park and clean and nice and you have to make it something good by making a picnic out of it or making it special by riding a bike... Its worth seeing and doing but there are alot of people in this area during cherry blossom season and also weekends. This a great place for families and for couples.
