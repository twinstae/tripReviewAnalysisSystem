0,5.0,"What a great travel system this is. So clean, easy to get around and inexpensive. We bought a travel card and put 10,000 won on it at a 7 eleven store and that lasted 8 days of city travel every day. It is easy to to travel as the lines are colour coded. The announcements are in Korean and English. The electronic display inside the carriages, is spoken in Korean and English as well as written.  Signs in the stations also have an arrow showing you what the next stop is in English. There is no eating or drinking on the subways so the area is clean. People are respectful and we felt safe even late at night. A great way to get around. There are quite a few stairs but usually you can find a lift as well. The shops are also amazing in the subways. Fully recommend using this transport system."
1,4.0,"Seoul is a big busy city with plenty of subway lines that can get really confused. However, if you plan ahead, it should. E fine. I've downloaded an app called Seoul Subway which seriously helped a lot.People in Seoul are generally OK except for the fact that they rarely say ""excuse me"" even in Korean so expect a lot of sudden pushing, shoving when someone needs to get on & off. I still do my basic of saying excuse me & thank you which helps that little bit."
2,5.0,"The metro is clean, fast and prompt ... but it is very big and you need to take a deep breath and plan your route ... after a shaky first day even my son could happily navigate around .. and it was such good value."
3,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is efficient and one of the cheapest way to travel in Seoul.  Get a T-Money card and forget about getting the single trip tickets which can be a pain during busy time with many tourists trying to do the same.  All stations we visited do have escalators in at least one of their exits but it could be a long walk if it is not the exit you needed.  Do look out for the signs for the dedicated seats for the pregnant, disabled and elderly if you are not one of these."
4,3.0,"Whilst the metro has better than average step free access, the directions were often confusing to the discerning tourist. However, what is annoying and its probably a cultural thing is the older generation when travelling with small children, they will actively come over and touch your child without your consent even if you have covered their faces with a hat as they will remove it to look and take pictures. I found this disturbing, also there are certain older gentlemen who were staring at our girls in a peculiar way and only looked away after I confronted them. So for this i am only giving a 3 and a warning to people thinking of travelling with young children."
5,5.0,"We travelled with 3 young children with 30000 won top-up value in our T-Money.Good to prepare your children their own lanyard so that they will not lose the T card.We were left with 17000 won at the end of the 7 day trip with 4 days of travelling by the subway.Plan your trip early and if in doubt check with the officer in the information room. They can speak good English. Do take not of the exit number of your destination too if not you can end up walking and crossing more.Getting off at the correct station and the exit is one thing, you also need to know which direction to walk to. Make sure you have good walking shoes for yourselves and the kids.Enjoy observing the locals when you travel. Most are oblivious tourists but it's ok. They are nice especially the older folks.It's an adventure on its own so smile and enjoy!"
6,5.0,"Used the subway during our entire stay period as it is useful and easy to navigate. Staff are friendly and direct us helpfully.Some line transfer may require some walking. But it is convenient and get us to the place without fuss as it is well connected.Each trip cost Korean Won 1,250 and fare is deducted when you enter the gate."
7,5.0,"Metro, tube or subway, every city has similar system. Difference is the language and the ease for passengers. Seoul Metro trains are wide, clean, with clear indication of the next station (in Korean and English) and which side the door opens. Stations are clean and well posted. At the platform, they indicate which is the next and preceding station so you know the direction of travel. There is even a visual sign that tells you the train is approaching a preceding station, leaving it and arriving at where you are. And to top it all, theres a fanfare music announcing the approaching train (like the fanfare one hears when Ryanair has safely landed). Seoul Metro manage to show that language is not a barrier and can be overcome with clear signs."
8,5.0,"Amidst the complicating train network, it is comforting to note that the trains itself are clean and they generally run on-time.  For somebody who does not speak Korean, it helps to have the KakaoMetro App as it helped me to plan my route.  That essentially saved me a lot of headache"
9,4.0,Train service that brings you everywhere.  Stations are clean and safe except for the occasional homeless taking shelter at night.
10,5.0,"Seoul metro was too good.It connected each and every area.Just carry a metro map along with you for checking out stations,transit,exits.We were there for 4days and used metro to the fullest.we used taxi only thrice that too for nearby places.Everybody is ready to help you even there is a language barrier.Just show them the place on map,they would help you out.This is the best ever public connectivity services I have ever seen.Have an happy stay at Seoul.For 4 days,we topup the card with ₩30,000 and this was sufficient."
11,5.0,"I’d advise all visitors to use the metro to get around, it’s inexpensive, clean, musical, and we’ll sign posted to all locations, buy yourself a plastic tmoney or another card and top it up at any party station with notes, even easy to do in Korean but it does provide English too. Many stations are well equipped with clean toilets, shops, shoe repair and cash machines. No one eats our drinks on the metro trains. People are generally quiet during the journeys. Plenty of lifts for people to use. Many stations do start to close from 23:00 on wards so download the app for the metro as you can put the times off your trips in the app. Lots of free WiFi too."
12,5.0,There are so many lines in Seoul and basically it covers most of the places which tourists most probably visit.
13,5.0,Cheap and easy to use. Whit T-money card you can use the subway without thinking about the right fare and spending time at the ticket machine. Just go through and scan the card entering and leaving.
14,5.0,Smooth efficient fast and pocket friendly!!!If you want to travel around seoul metro is the way to go about! Super clean and quiet even when it is crowded.
15,4.0,"Connects various parts of the city very well. Cars are very clean and there are enough signs to show upcoming stations. Unlike Japan, you cannot hear the in car announcements clearly. Similarly, people are allowed to talk while traveling in the train. You should avoid peek hour traffic as people are in a hurry and expect to be pushed - they may not be polite as they are in a hurry"
16,4.0,"We are a family from Hong Kong so we are familiar with metro stations. We didn’t have too much of a problem navigating, however at one point I did ask which direction to get on the train as most things are labeled in korean or with Korean names. But it’s definitely efficient and safe. Would recommend"
17,4.0,The metro was really reliable and fast. Easy way to get around.  Download the metro map onto your phone.
18,5.0,"Stations , trains and platforms so clean and well maintained. So much space with platforms very wide. Trains very frequent with sliding doors to protect from the open tracks. Not ideal for disabled or with heavy luggage as not too many lifts around.Colour coded system and tap on/ off cards used which can be purchased and topped up."
19,5.0,"At first seemed complicated,  but when you figure it out it is quite easy to use. The people around are also quite helpful."
20,5.0,Packed but you could go pretty much anywhere in Seoul by metro. It is so efficient. Timing is super accurate. Helps that Koreans respect the 'elderly' and 'pregnant / women with children' seat assignments. Stops at strategic locations in town. Always lots of people but so reliable.
21,5.0,As you might expect the train system in Korea is very efficient and easy to use. Its a color system so even non speakers like my self can get around using a metro map.
22,5.0,"It's pretty easy to get from place to place on the train. Easy way of commute in Seoul. Just make sure one get onto the correct line depicted by different colors and numbers. Many of the stations do not have escalators up/ down so be prepared to walk up/ down long flights of stairs. Once out of the platform and at the scammers there are many signboards to show the directions, just have to pay close attention. There are numerous stations along the different lines and for example Myeongdong can be accessed via different lines.Good rides on the trains."
23,5.0,"During my visit to seoul i have used the metro to move around recommend places for shopping , sightseeing and dining , i have to say it was above my expectations for its cleanliness and punctuality of timing. Easy straightforward of ticket purchases and following of stations maps and signs.Tickets are very reasonable price especially to avoid the road traffic compared to taxi."
24,5.0,It is amazing to me that the subway stations and trains can be kept so pristine. It was such a pleasure to ride the trains and so convenient. We learned to stay quiet and to model our behavior after the locals. Definitely the easiest way to get around a big city. Have fun 😊
25,5.0,The metro card required 3000W deposit which is refundable. It is very easy to purchase or top up via the machine as it has instruction in various languages. The Seoul metro is a very complex networks that is very effective to travel. It will definitely help to download the subway Korea app.
26,5.0,"Clean, easy and effective...what else? There is not any trace of smell of urine.  Unbelivable! It's very cheap, just 1 dollar for one ride."
27,5.0,"If you've been to Singapore then the Seoul metro is very similar. Ticket machines are easy to use and a single trip is roughly $2 AUD per person and you get a refund on the ticket at the end of the trip.We had a couple of problems with the machines, if you put coins in too fast the transaction will cancel and once we had a ticket that we could not refund.The announcements are in multiple languages and the trains are all air conditioned. Like Singapore there is no access to the lines so no accidents of falling onto the tracks or people running from one platform to the other.There are food stalls and markets at most stations.Not all levels have escalators so if you have luggage, sometimes it's a haul up stairs.The afternoon knock off is always busy, but with trains roughly every 2 minutes it's no big deal to wait for the next one.You'll find most Koreans are fairly rude when entering/exiting and it's not uncommon to see elderly people pushed out of the way.  There is no real chivalry for seating either but then again this is the liberal age.Overall easy to use and a lot cheaper than a taxi."
28,5.0,"With only USD1(starting rate, depends on the distance) you can get almost all the attractions and places in and around Seoul by this metro. Very clean, easy to reach and transfer. Remember when you get in out at the gate, touch the metro card on your right hand and push the gate bar on the left hand."
29,5.0,"We took the metro everywhere during our stay and it was great. My husband, meanwhile, took taxis and constantly got stuck in traffic (as did we, using the bus to get to the airport). Whenever possible, take the train."
30,3.0,"Directions and stations have english letters so easy to follow, not so crowded and got enough space for the elderly."
31,5.0,The Seoul metro is very convenient.  I wish the stops were illuminated on a board inside the train like Shanghai metros.
32,4.0,"We enjoyed taking the train around Seoul.  Pretty easy after you figure things out. Remember to press English before you start buying your train pass.  However, didn't need to press English anymore since its about 3 steps to reload your card."
33,5.0,A nice interesting place to connect trains as well as do some shopping and have quick meals. Certain airlines you can check in your flight from here
34,5.0,"It is one of the best metro systems I ride.  Quite punctual with English announcements. Nobody is drinking or eating at the metro and nobody make ling calls it is not acceptable by others,"
35,3.0,"Only made two short trips, one direction the cars were really packed with standing room only. Some difficulty for people with handicap that long standing ride would cause stress. Overall this was a positive experience."
36,5.0,"Don't hesitate to use Seoul Metro! Signs in English. Super easy and economical.  Clean stations and trains, restrooms available at almost every station were clean and stocked.  Great experience."
37,5.0,The idea way to travel around Seoul. Use various apps to assist as it can be a little confusing in the beginning. Google Map isn’t supported in Seoul so we had to resort to other apps to help us. Such an incredibly clean metro system. Extremely safe and on time. Best way for travel around the city! Buy cards from a 7-Eleven and you can get a refund on the balance remaining at the airport before you leave the country!
38,5.0,"Easy to manoeuvre around,You can buy Metro tickets at the stations or in a 7/11.  Charge them with money when you buy them, most journeys cost about 1,250 Won which isn’t more than £1, children are charged less. Just swipe them as you go in the station, swipe as you leave the station. There is a machine in the station if you want the unused money returned, or just leave on the card for your next journey. Metro maps are clear and easy to navigate around. I personally love the different little tunes the station plays when a new train arrives. Very clean and feels safe. No problems.  We bought cartoon character cards just for fun but standard cards cost less. Ask for metro cards, choose your card and off you go!! Enjoy x"
39,4.0,"First the system covers extensive area. Signage & instructions are very clear in four languages ie Korean, Chinese, English & Japanese. Even the  in carriage announcement are in four languages.Second, it is a very reasonable price and I would say that it is very cheap with the level of service. Clean and allow drinks in train but Korean locals are very considerate and no rubbish at all. Pregnant woman not matter how earlier in their pregnancy will have designated seats available in each carriage. Constant announcements to remind passengers in 4 languages. Some transfer stations are large and you may have to walk a few minutes so you need to watch for the closest transfer and pick the most convenient transfer line . It is the first time for us to visit Seoul and it only cost us 4200 Korean won to travel 55Kms from airport to the city central. 👍👍👍."
40,5.0,"Seoul metro makes getting around the city so easy, as does the frequency of the trains as they go every couple of minutes. It is very easy to navigate and a fast cheap way to get around.Some of the metro shops are actually like underground towns there are so many shops and stalls etcWould definitely recommend this as the best way to travel in  Seoul"
41,4.0,Seoul subway system is a dense networked subway system. It's easy to use and inexpensive means to travel across the city.
42,5.0,It is always clean and easy to aceess many of places. Many of lines make you complicate but once you notice thire system you might understand how convenient it is.
43,5.0,We enjoy a lot with the system. We can go everywhere we are about to go by the system and it is very English friendly & easy to understand. The fare is reasonable & its underground walk gives another plus. It has a lot of trains & starts early and last train is always late. 這個系統很便捷，我們想去的地方都可以用這個系統過去，英文友善而且容易瞭解，價錢合理而且很多地下通道可以遮陽擋雨變成大加分，車子很多而且開始早又結束晚。
44,4.0,"Foreigners? First timers? No worries. English, Japanese and Chinese announcements are made every minute in the subway. Even directions are written in different languages. Their system is very helpful and the fare is cheap. You can go anywhere with the subway. You don’t have to worry about traffic. It comes on time."
45,5.0,We travelled by metro on our 10 day trip to Seoul. Great service. Eveywhere was clean and tidy. Every member of staff was helpful.  We used T money cards which made for very cheap travel.
46,5.0,"Transportation in Seoul was superb. We stayed at Namyeong area and and it was so convenient for us using the subway although with 3 young children ages 4 & 5, two (2) infants 1 yr 10 months old.  The only thing we need to study and understand the colour and and the line number of the subway map for us to move around.From Namyeong, we went to places like Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, Namdaemon, Itaewon, etc.  all by subway"
47,5.0,"Cheap transportation that will bring you anywhere.  inexpensive, easy to understand.  Buy a T-money card, it's cheaper and saves you time."
48,5.0,The subway in Seoul is clean and efficient. It is easy to navigate and you can get to all areas of the city by switching from 1 line to another. It costs approximately $1.25 per trip per person. It may be a bit difficult for a non Korean person although there are words in English and if you know what station you are headed to it gets pretty simple. There are also many food stands and shops inside various stations across the city. It can get very crowded during rush hour but just shove your way on and you will be fine. No use being dainty and reserved. People don’t take offense to being bumped into as it is part of the culture.
49,4.0,Extensive network makes exploring Seoul convenient on the Seoul Metro. Ticket machines are in English. Takes cash only. No credit cards. Stations and trains are clean and well maintained. Lots of underground shops within the stations. Remember to collect your 500 Won refund after using your ticket.
50,5.0,We have nice time to raid the train and easy to know the next stop the train was clean and good arrange
51,5.0,"Fantastic, clean and on time metro system. No problem not knowing Korean, everything in English. Very easy to navigate Seoul...Excellent metro..."
52,5.0,"When I arrived at the Incheon (ICN) Airport, I bought a T-Money Card and loaded it with Korean Won. Used the AREX train to go to Seoul (and back to ICN). And used the subway trains within Seoul. Just tap-on and tap-off when using the Seoul Metro. Easy."
53,5.0,"We walked from our hotel to Myeongdong Station and purchased a card/ticket (they do not have paper tickets) for Dongdaemun History & Culture Park to access the DDP and Cheonggyecheon Stream. Subway is very fast, easy, clean, and pleasant. After departing the station, you have the option to return your plastic ticket in a machine for a 500-won refund. Or you can keep it as a souvenir."
54,5.0,"The metro is great.  It's very inexpensive, clean, goes most everywhere and the stops are announced in English."
55,5.0,"Really nice having Lebaran Holiday to Seoul and Busan With Fam Brother n Wife Sister and 3 Nephews. This is my first to Korea while my fam bros and sis, they are the second time. Hereare my reviews and my experiences while I was there on 07 - 13 June 2019."
56,5.0,"I cannot read Hangul, but I have found traveling all around Seoul by metro to be very easy experience, especially if you download KakaoMetro app to your phone.  It is available in English, and will easily allow you to plan your trip (gives you exact times of trains, too)."
57,5.0,It is the cheapest way to move around the city and it is everywhere. Make sure your hotel is close to one of the station in Seoul. Just comparable to what Tokyo.
58,5.0,"For one thing I can say about the trains in Korea: they are extremely efficient. You can practically go around their country via train be it in a subway or above ground. Point A to point B was never this efficient! In all fairness, Korea has more land area than SG or HK but still, the massive railway network is quite overwhelming! It may take a while for you to get used to where to get on and get off, but for one thing that I was most impressed of is how they treat passengers with very young children. Even old people on the train would give up their seats and insist that you take it so your little child can sit down. (Very friendly people!) If there is one thing I noticed about the Korean people, is that they are friendly and accommodating to tourists, even if they are not that fluent in English."
59,5.0,"Unique experience with Train, It is cheaper than using taxi but you have to get used to walk up and down stairs. Dont forget to take 500 won deposit back after single ride. There are some stores in this underground station, you can try Gangnam Station to shop around and Jamsil Station."
60,5.0,"The metro service is efficient and easy to use. We bought the Tmoney card and it can be reloaded at all stations. It cost 1250 won per trip for adults and 720 won per trip for teens. For teens, you need to register at the point of purchase to get the discount. Koreans are helpful. My daughter was unable to exit one of the stations and a Korean helped her. Do take note that there is a lot of walking and climbing of stairs, especially if you need to change lines. You also need to figure out the next station to determine the direction you are heading to. The metro can get a little crowded during peak hours but there are enough trains to cater for the crowd. All in all, the metro is highly recommended."
61,5.0,Very easy to navigate the metro. Ease of use and convenient. connects almost every part of seoul and beyond.
62,5.0,"Beautifully decorated, clean and fast. Easy to get around with signs and announcements in English. The subway cars are spacious, the tracks are inaccessible, behind glass gates."
63,5.0,"Cars and station platforms very clean. Travel was easy to maneuver, especially with the free app. Super inexpensive, too."
64,5.0,"This is the ultimate way of travelling. You might have a little problem navigating in the beginning but trust me you will get over that. Its quite cheap and very fast to travel with the metro and you will enjoy watching all the people that are buried in the phones. I have never seen so many people at the same time with their head in their phones, almost 100% of the people did it :)"
65,5.0,"catching the Metro was fun, and really unlocked Seoul. Much cheaper than taxis and quicker to, really felt like a local"
66,5.0,"We just loved korean metro and used only that to move aroud in Seoul. It is very clean, easy, afficient and cheep way to get almost everywhere in Seoul."
67,5.0,"Seoul has one of the best metros. Wide network, safe, very clean. Metro stations are big but signs are everywhere and info is coming also in English."
68,5.0,"The subway in Seoul is very easy to navigate, a smooth ride and very reasonably priced.  The KakaoMetro app is free, very helpful, easy to use and gives excellent information."
69,5.0,"We decided to take the metro on a recent trip. It was so easy! We purchased the card at the airport. The trains run frequently and on time. They are clean! They are easy to navigate, and best, they are very cost effective!"
70,5.0,"Spent a lot of time on the Metro, it was great for getting around Seoul. Stations all have the large glass walls to keep people off tracks and the trains are easier to understand than in Tokyo. Be careful through the station use turnstiles and it was hard to get strollers through. Be sure to get a t money card for ease of use, it also works on buses."
71,5.0,"This was one of the few times that I had to ride the metro all day, every day. Being from the city of cars, Los Angeles, I wasn't used to riding the metro to get from one place to another. Using a metro app for the stops and the metro bus app, you can pretty much get anywhere with a little walking and timing.to get from one side of the city, I stayed at DMC to the east side of the city, is about 1.5 hours. Finding everything in between you can really make use of the extensive metro network.There is also a huge underground subway culture, with its own food and bakeries and retail booths. Some mom and pop and others slightly bigger, such as Daiso.Go prepared with comfortable shoes and get ready to walk, but its worth it. Every stop is audible in English and Korean. At times it can get crowded but you'll get the hang of it real quick."
72,5.0,"The subways system is large and efficient and the tickets are very affordable, at least compared to the Stockholm (Sweden) subway system. As most subway systems around the world this one is also very packed at rush hour, and you will have to be prepared to stand up. You can easily buy tickets at the stations in machines but only with cash. If you want to buy a subway card to load this can be done in convenience stores, but also only with cash!"
73,5.0,"Get Tmoney card at convenience store; reload card for subway, buses, airport bus, etc. EZ system to get around Seoul."
74,5.0,"Family of 3 adults.  Transport around City very easy - particularly as we bought our AMAZINGPAY cards at Airport for Won 50,000 (including Won 4,000 fee).  We used it everywhere and topped up at 7-11."
75,5.0,"The Seoul Metro was a bit complicated to use, and without a proper app one might feel a bit overwhelmed and lost around the metro. However, it is an efficient and fast way to go around the city. The trains are clean and fast. Totally recommended."
76,5.0,"I was afraid at first that we would get lost in Seoul because the train system seemed so large and complex, and that the station names would be in Korean Script. Luckily, I was wrong. It was daunting in the beginning but if you know where you're going and which stops and routes to take then you can navigate with ease around Seoul via the Metro. The PA delivers announcements in Korean, English, and Chinese. Likewise, the LCDs also have a multi-language display if you didn't quite hear the PA. I traveled with two children and the people were very polite and gave them their seat as the children were not tall enough to hold on to the handles."
77,4.0,"So clean, so easy to use, so good. I'm giving my recomendation as for great metro solution. Using and uploading transport card is a simple system."
78,4.0,Machines easy to operate and with the traffic in Seoul this mode of transport quite convenient except that they dont have escalators which could be a challenge for those with strollers as well as the elderly.
79,5.0,"Make sure to use the KakaoMetro app for easy on- and offline navigation. And the T-Money Card (in any convenience store or kiosk) to pay for the fares. All station names are written in korean AND in latin spelling. In the Metro cars , english names of stations are displayed and also narrated over the speaker = really easy to use for tourists!"
80,5.0,"I had heard great things about the metro and they are all true.  It is easy to get yourself setup but warning, you will need Korean currency.  No problem if you come into Seoul Station from the airport.  Once at Seoul, find an ATM, get cash, then walk over to the many vending machines that say T-Money Cards.  Each card will run about 4000 Won.  Next, find a metro Kiosk, and recharge the card for the amount you want and off you are.The metro is easy and I recommend downloading the KakaoMetro app which will make figuring out what train to use so easy.  All the signs are English making it that much easier to use."
81,5.0,"Definitely this subway was tremendous, for tourists is not easy reading the names of the stations, but everything became quite simple once I downloaded some apps from the AppStore that aid me how to move into the subway (“Seoul Subway”). You can get anywhere in Seoul using the subway, also is “cheap” compared to the other transports."
82,5.0,"I love it, Easy and Convenient to move Seoul. Clean And Safety also. Everybody enjoy Seoul Metro system."
83,5.0,"We visited Seoul for a week and used the subway as our main mode of transportation.  Wanting to see it all, we criss-crossed the city many times.Most signs are in English, so it is easy to navigate without knowing Korean. Seoul Metro covers a lot of ground - so if you're going from one end of Seoul to another, expect to be on the train for a while.  I found the train cars wider than most other cities and provided a more roomier feel.  The stations, platforms, and trains are very clean and the system is very safe.There are a few drawbacks, however.  We bought subway cards that had a somewhat expensive deposit.  We could not easily return those cards for a refund.  I suggest skipping that.Each ticket is its own little card which has a small deposit.  We quickly became habituated to turning in the cards for the refund as we exited.  While this isn't such a headache, it does add time to the trip.Some of the exit stairs are very steep.  I believe all stations have elevators to the street, so there are options if you have a disability or if you are wheeling heavy luggage.Overall, Seoul Metro is highly recommended"
84,5.0,"Seoul Metro system is on point. It's not hard to figure out like some Tokyo where you go to the same place roundtrip but you end up taking different routes for higher prices. You can relatively go to anywhere by the metro to include the airports effectively for a great price that I consider a bargain to get around the cities and it's suburbs. I hardly drive in Seoul because of the metro, that's a plus."
85,4.0,"Thankfully I have a teenager with some basic understanding of Korean to help navigate. After a few days things became much easier but the initial impression is utter confusion. The underground network is so incredibly expansive! Would be helpful if there were more subway maps around, there were too few sprinkled around. And as a tourist, suggest avoiding rush hour for the sheer mass of commuters moving around. You'd just feel in the way trying to figure out where you need to go while everyone rushes around you. Fairly clean and lots of food at most stations.  Always felt safe, at anytime of day or even late at night. No homeless or scary people, and didn't smell bad as some other major metro city subway systems internationally. I've experienced NYC, San Francisco, London, and Paris subway systems and Seoul and Paris were the best in terms of above metrics."
86,5.0,We use this as a mode of transportation during our travel. The service is so efficient and the train arrival time is punctual. The subway itself is so colorful and the subway system is efficient.
87,5.0,English translations can be found of station names and for ticket purchasing. The don’t May be a bit small in some cases but it was possible to navigate without assistance. In 4 days I only used the metro once- from Dongdaeipgu (Dongguk University) to the Anguk station ostensibly to find Hanbok Rental places on the way to changdeokgungpalace. The problem was that once we got out of the station we got disoriented and found it difficult getting help in English. The metro itself is very clean and many trains are timed like those in Tokyo so you know how long you have to wait for the next.
88,5.0,"We found it easy to navigate our way around the metro system to reach all the sites which we wanted to visit. Signs are in both Korean and English and the same with on board announcements when approaching the stations. You need to obtain a travel card which can be purchased form CU and Seven stores, Just top up as you go at the stations, Cards can  be used on the metro, buses, taxis and airport stopping service (£2:50) but not the airport express. Fares are very cheap. You can purchase a single ticket but trips are cheaper with the card (about 80 Pence per trip) for up to 12 Kilometers. When you leave you can get a refund of the amount left on your card less a 500 won fee, there is a CU store at the airport."
89,5.0,"Always remember to get your deposit back if you are using a single fare card.We used it many times and found it very easy to get.  Just use the card machines, select your destination, select number of tickets and pay."
90,5.0,This is a train that we went to and it was fun.all the time we spent it together. Onni suri is very freindly.
91,5.0,"We tour Seoul using subways and it was the best choice. With the traffic on the road, subways makes travelling at ease."
92,5.0,"Despite the intimidating maze of lines spidering all over the city, riding the subway in Seoul is fairly painless and navigable without understanding the Korean language. The trains are clean, efficient and punctual. Apart from getting somewhere, to experience Seoul properly you need to go underground to see the hive of activity around subway stations. However, sometimes there can be a deceptively long walk to change subway lines, and depending on where you are going it may be faster to catch a bus."
93,5.0,"Take the metro all over on your trip, we used Kakao Metro and it is simple! Adults ₩ per trip is 1,250₩ and we averaged about 4₩ per day.  It’s safe quite and easy to get about."
94,5.0,"The Seoul Metro has evolved to become a convenient commute for Koreans and tourists. I do not know the exact amount but each trip of about 1-6 stations cost between KRW1,000-2,000. You can basically travel to any parts of Seoul on the metro."
95,5.0,"Pretty easy to understand, some steps if you can't find the elevator. Very affordable, fast and convenient."
96,4.0,Korean’s train tend to be more noisy than Japan’s train. Noises are both from the voice of the passengers and the sound of the train. Sometimes i almost missed my stop because i can’t hear the announcement stop. Also the announcement tv board (especially for English) is passed so fast.
97,1.0,The metro is just okay. Nothing fancy. The trains look tired and there is minimal English translations. The signage inside the train has small fonts for English. It was kinda difficult. The JR trains is Japan are much better. Even the train in Bangkok is better!
98,5.0,"I was afraid to travel in Seoul because I wasn't sure if I could navigate the subways.  I was ready to take taxis everywhere. But the Seoul metro is so easy to figure out.  It allowed me to be among local residents from all walks of life.  I enjoyed every ride, even when it was crowded."
99,4.0,"Not have a high expectation of Seoul MTR after read some comments on internet. However my personal experience is quite good after took MTR everyday when I was in Seoul.The components are wider and higher than HK MTR trains, seats are much like Japanese trains. As long as you have no problem on walking for a while, it’s still convenient for tourists since the signs are very clear and won’t mislead you even though you maybe not understand Korean.We were staying at Hongdae and took MTR to all the sightseeing and famous tourism places. Only took shuttle to everland and taxi to airport. 在閱讀了一些關於互聯網的評論之後，我們對首爾地鐵沒有很高的期望。然而，事實上我在首爾的每天乘坐地鐵後，我的個人體驗非常好。它的車厢比香港地鐵列車更寬更高，座位很像日本列車。只要你不怕在轉線時需要步行一段時間，對於遊客來說地鐵绝對是方便和經濟的選擇。因為地鐵的標誌非常清楚，即使你可能不懂韓語，也不會誤導你。我們住在弘大，幾乎都是乘坐地鐵到所有觀光和著名的旅遊景點。只是乘坐班車前往愛寶樂園和出租車到機場。"
100,4.0,While the size and sheer number of lines can make it confusing it is a good way to travel around Seoul. After buying ticket from machine (in English) you selection your destination and away you go. Remember to get your refund at the end of the trip (assuming you are buying single trip ) I recall there being full day pass if you plan on going to many places during the day.
101,5.0,"You can go anywhere using the subway, there is quite a bit of English, and Chinese and Japanese too. Pay attention to the line numbers and the destinations though, a map is required keep it with you."
102,5.0,"We took taxis for some of our trips around Seoul, but I still prefer the Seoul Metro. Very efficient and some times could be faster than taxis if you factor in the traffic jams. Seats are reasonably comfortable. There are sections where you are expected to give up for the elderly."
103,4.0,"Highly efficient and reliable with good frequency, the Metro is a cheap and very user friendly way to get around Seoul."
104,5.0,"Seoul metro is easy to navigate, safe and clean. We took it to and from the airport and all around the city. No need to waste money on a can."
105,5.0,I've been on a lot of subways on many cities around the world but this one rocks. If you have the metro app on your phone you'll never get lost and the trains run exactly on time.
106,5.0,We buy Tmoney card for subway. We always use subway everyday in Seoul. I think it is the best way and the cheapest transport in Seoul. We can go to many places by subway
107,5.0,The metro was quite easy we ask the hotel before we live.Easy and fast i really enjoyed to see the real life in Seoul but I didn’t take my kids with me at metro
108,4.0,"We used the Seoul Metro from time to time along with buses and taxis. The metro system is very convenient and we usually were able to find a seat on it. Mostly we used the metro within the downtown area, but we did notice that sometimes there were long walks in the subway area to get to our destinations. Something that we really  did like is the existence of English speak guides in some of the main stations. These guides are not only found in the subway system but also at most of the attractions around the city."
109,5.0,Excellent metro on time fairly easy to navigate with stations named in English and announcements on train in 3 languages including English
110,5.0,"We just spent the holiday weekend in Seoul. We flew into Inchon, rented some WiFi's and jumped on the metro for Myeongdong. It's so easy to navigate Seoul on the Metro. We downloaded the metro app, which is helpful, though I have the metro map in English which is easier for me to see. Anyway, the subway itself is very clean. Remember to check outside of the restroom for toilet paper dispenser. One of the restrooms did not have dispensers in the stalls. Luckily I had a little pouch of tissues in my backpack. The trains are clean and warm as well (it was mostly below 30*F all weekend).I love the fact that the tracks are behind glass for extra safety."
111,4.0,Very good easy to use. Cheap way of getting around city. lot of attendants speak english and can help work out how to get around.
112,5.0,"Excellent train infrastructure and service. Probably easier to look up Google maps and will show you which train, train lines and exit to use. Economic and fess free travel. Be sure to look up which exit to take otherwise it is quite a distance from one exit to another. Highly recommended"
113,3.0,"I still see so many people who don't care about taking chairs for pregnant women, the elderly and those with special needs"
114,5.0,"There is no way you can make sense of the metro system without the city app, so download it to really benefit from the ease, comfort of the public transit. Just stay clear of the designated seats if you do not qualify for one and be watchful of the evening traffic of inebriated commuters who tend to spew orange when they feel ill. Otherwise, in the depth of winter, the heated seats are a great way to warm up you toosh!"
115,5.0,"You can really understand where to go when looking at the metro map inside the station and inside the train, the bright colours to indicate lines are really pleasing, line interchanges are convenient, also those gates that prevent people from falling on to tracks are real nice and cool, my country(Australia) subway system, stations, and trains really sucks compared to yours."
116,5.0,Seoul Metro has a well established network and metro system. Easy to use. Comparable to Tokyo Metro. The only difference with Tokyo Metro is that Japanese commuters do not make noise in the carriage.
117,4.0,"T Money Card is $4 to buy then you top up with money from connivence store. Rides are cheap and you can also get from the airport to major areas. Once you read the signs and they are in English too, you will get used to it, the only issues is which exit to come out of once your at the station."
118,5.0,"Very convenient, user friendly, not complicated.Recommended for free and easy travellers. T-Card is a must for Seoul."
119,4.0,"metro in seoul is really convenient, one can get to many attractions  just outside the metro station!!"
120,5.0,It was really efficient & convenient since one pass can be used in all lines. It made our travel hassle free! 👍🏻
121,5.0,"Easy to use, very well covered, accessibility is ample and simple to use. Inexpensive as compared to many countries."
122,3.0,"The trains are clean and easy to use if you do some planning ahead. Unfortunately, when we purchase or Tourist Card, it didn't give us back any change and there was no staff around to help us."
123,5.0,The metro system is very extensive and easy to use. There are multiple exits at each stop. It is clean and feels safe.
124,4.0,"Seoul metro is a quite different, indeed. I travelled with my mom (on wheel chair). The metro was wheel chair friendly, elevators were available. Once, it happened that we went to the wrong track and needed to go to the other platform but first we had to exit and re-entered (we did this once, what a cost). But a friendly Korean lady explained to us that we didn't need to do that. At the metro gate, just push the green button (usually placed on the wheel chair entrance), and the metro staff would come. You just to explain that you need to change track, she/he would assist you and you don't have to but any ticket anymore."
125,5.0,"Get a T card to have discounted travel. You have to pay for the T card and load value so you will only find value if you use the card a few times on your trip (discounts only apply to adults so did children is best is just buy single-use tix). The metro is clean and efficient. Though crowded, patrons are orderly and generally polite. There are generally announcements in both Korea and English but is best to be clear on which stops you want first in case. Overall we found it easy to get around."
126,5.0,Really simple!They have machines that help you with a temporary ticket or you can go to a convenience shop to grab a Tmoney card for longer periods. The app KakaoMetro is the best! Tracking stop by stop and transfers. I love it! They have KakaoMap also to help as well as chat for messages.
127,4.0,"The route network covers most areas in Seoul.  However, the frequency during peak hours was not ideal. Fare prices reasonable.  One setback, some older folks are rude and will simply push their way out when it was crowded. Not even a word of apology or ' excuse me'. Very unfiltered ppl. Overall it's a good and efficient transportation."
128,5.0,"Download the subway app online and it is easy to get around all the various attractions in Seoul.  Easy to use, convenient. Clean n efficient. Best way to get around seoul!"
129,5.0,This a wonderful transportation easy fast you will not wait long from one to next the stations has small market if you need to buy express things if you remain balance in your T money card before fly back be sure that you can refund the amount from the station itself either from the machine or from the office itself I was using CU+and I refund my balance very easy
130,4.0,Extensive connections. Easy to move from place to place including airport. Recommend to get single trip ticket if no plans to travel extensively. We bought t-money card and realised that the cards are not refundable.
131,4.0,You can download an app which is useful to plan your travel. Convenient way to go around Seoul. You can purchase a single trip tickets or top up for multiple journey.
132,4.0,"The metro in Seoul is well connected, and can almost get you to various places of interests, either on the metro network or together with the equally efficient bus network.During winter, the seats are heated and that is well appreciated in the freezing cold. The trains are generally very clean, but they do get very crowded during rush hours and on popular routes. One down side is that the stations are mostly stairs, with an elevator at the far end or maybe an escalator. Also at some stations, if you go to the wrong platform (ie. opposite direction), it is a challenge getting to the correct one. Nonetheless, the metro is recommended for travelling around Seoul - get make sure you buy a store-value card which is available from the ticketing machines at the stations. Do also download KakaoMap to help you in your search of train routes."
133,4.0,"Overall, my experience in this was good, but except for the fact that it was so compact that I couldn't even bare to sit for even a second. If anyone is in a hurry and does not care about cleanness and comfort, please go ahead and use. If anyone is troubled by this, there are other ways of getting by, but this may be the cheapest way to get through the day."
134,5.0,"It's amazing , on time, fast, reliable and safe and cheap.. makes the london underground feel like a third world train system in comparison"
135,3.0,"This isn't a Metro as much as a subway on train tracks. The stations are signed poorly, and overall navigation hard between the lines. ONE HUGE TIP: Download the app Subway Korea. Once we downloaded that, the confusion was greatly minimized, although finding the right line still presented itself a challenge."
136,5.0,"we travelled by bus and subway,  mostly by bus and all was amazing.  They have bus lanes which makes travel quick even at rush hour."
137,4.0,Koreans are generally very polite and courteous. A lady offered me a seat while I was travelling in a metro. Some folks even offered my young daughter sweets while touring Seoul.
138,4.0,"Efficient, on-time and english instructions throughout for easy navigation. Only downside is that the staff are not very helpful."
139,5.0,"It is absolutely the way to get around in Seoul...although taxis are fairly cheap, this was a great option."
140,5.0,"The fastest, easiest, safest way to enjoy Seoul. The metro system goes anywhere in Seoul. But, you'd better avoid the rush hours when it is very crowded."
141,5.0,Get a T money card and load 10 000 Won - that will give you 8 rides as each trip in Seoul is deducted at 1250 per trip upon entry. Fast and easy to navigate and so easy to change tracks to any location u want to go to
142,4.0,The subway metro line is quite confusing and a lot of walking for transfer of line. However the service is quite prompt and comfortable.
143,4.0,"Seoul metro is the most convenient way to get to places you want in Seoul, since there is so much traffic in Seoul. Metro is the fast way too, but people can be rude stepping on your feet and pushing during rush hours and they might not even apologize."
144,5.0,"The coming of trains is signalled by a music playing. This ensures that passengers will definitely know the coming of train. Plush seats. Different lengths of hand grabs for diffferent heights of people. Overall, it’s an efficient mode of transport around the country. Numbering of lines are simple from 1 - 9. Announcements are made in both korean and English."
145,5.0,"The Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a metropolitan railway system consisting of 22 rapid transit, light metro, commuter rail and people mover lines located in northwest South Korea. The system serves most of the Seoul Metropolitan Area including the Incheon metropolis and satellite cities in Gyeonggi province."
146,3.0,"They just don't want to build the lift or escalator all the way! Some escalator can stop at the middle and you have to climb. It's very inconvenience if you bring a stroller or handicap with wheelchair. Myeongdong station is a good example. With a baby stroller, prepare to climb at least two staircase. Some subway line with same colour will slip into two location. The captain will only report in Korean! Very bad experience when we try subway to Onyangoncheon Station! Lesson learned is to take KTX! Other then that, subway is clean! Convenience, on time, not expensive and you can eat some snack or drink!"
147,3.0,"The subway from airports are fast and comfy, all the way to the heart of seoul and you can change trains to various location easily. But navigating may be a bit of a hassle. The main complain abou the subway is, there are very little escalator which helps you and your heavy luggage, or older people with weak knees, or handicap with leg problem. Even the most popular myeong dong area where people buy kilos of stuff and carry in luggage needs to lug it up and down stairs and is tiring.Cost of travelling within 5 km is around USD 1.25 each trip, buying their store value card if you are there for more than 5 days will be worth it, kids with child cards gets to travel cheaper.At the end of your trip, just go to any convenience store and get refund for your cards, but you loose deposit money."
148,5.0,Pick up a simple map at the airport and also a full map and then go off both of them. The simple map is the easiest to see routes that you need and the full map shows you all the things in between the stops. The simple map is not draw to scale or even along the actual route path so you can’t go off it for planning your sightseeing. ONLY use the simple map for reminding of where the on off or transfer is. Also the phonetic English spelling is different compared to each map and the posted signs and the maps on the subway walls. But each station name is the same throughout. So you have to check the Korean characters to make sure it’s the same one that you want. It Really isn’t too difficult to navigate at all.
149,5.0,The buses are very easy to navigate. Especially with an app like CityMapper. Stops are announced in English. Buses are clean and not crowded.
150,4.0,"Express train comfortable seats, very easy to navigate, and quicker than bus or taxi and scenery is wonderful."
151,3.0,we got lost  in the metro - entered the wrong direction and had to ask for assistance to be let out. Another thing is underground connections not straight forward. Some involve lots of walking and staircases between lines
152,5.0,"Well connected, super convenient and Easy to commute. Well announced making it the preferred mode of transportation for foreigners"
153,5.0,Definitely top 5 subway/metro system in the world. Theres no place that you can’t reach on it in Seoul.
154,5.0,"This is a very convenient, fast and cheaper way to go around South Korea.Elevators and escalators are available in most stops. There were designated areas for those with strollers / wheelchairs / luggages.Like many new places, navigating takes some getting used to. But there are train navigation apps that can be used to make it easier. You get the hang of it after a day or two of going around."
155,4.0,Seoul metro is easy to use and a wonderful way to travel considering that if you attempt to drive you will have serious issues!
156,5.0,"the subway is the most wonderful means of transportation in Korea, as there are no traffic jams, light, clean, safe, buy a T-money card and ride, even all day. Only the T-money is necessary not to forget to reload. Under the ground right entire cities, space and light. Even sometimes you forget that you are underground. Take at least the transition from the subway to Lotte tower and Lotte World, fantastic!"
157,4.0,"Easy to commute between places. I would advise not to get the travel card which will cost 4,000won (non-refundable) if you’re only using the metro for 2-3 days. Just buy the ticket at the station."
158,4.0,"There were a lot of food stall in a few station but amazingly the area was clean during my journey in using the metro. Easily download naver and korean Subway and together they provides a good direction for our journey. Maybe it will be better if they provide more direction for elevator access. Because it eas strictly prohibited to use the escalator with a stroller and sometimes there were only stairs or maybe we just couldnt find the elevator. Some of the line were really crowded at certain times, but sometimes we found it empty."
159,5.0,"Everything is great. Train is very neat, almost no trash whatsoever. Timing is also very accurate. What needs improvement is the availability of more signs in English language."
160,5.0,"Seoul subway lines is easy to understand, affordable, clean, kids friendly and also on time.It's a good mass transportation connecting the whole area in Seoul. So you can explore Seoul using the subway train."
161,4.0,"Great subway system, easy to understand maps.Conveniently located at all the major attractions, will recommend travellers to have a go at it. Buy a new card from the station or any convenient stores, top up at stations with cash and you are good to go.Trips cost within the city is a fix rate, at Korean won 1,250 or 1,280. And if you travel further, it’s an extra 100 won.Download the Korean subway map for easy transits.Most of the stations comes with an elevator for the elderly, wheelchair, stroller and luggage.Gates are clearly stated too!"
162,2.0,"Trains going in different directions are not interconnected below. So if you accidentally entered the wrong direction, you will need to pay for one way trip just to tag out & in again in the opposite direction. Furthermore, a lot of the stations do not have elevator/escalator & mostly are staircases. My mom has bad knee & have to climb so many stairs. A good example is Myeongdong station. There is escalator to go up from B2F to B1F. Then, a flight of stairs (all exits are the same) from B1F to 1F. Bad knee + heavy luggage is definitely not easy. So not tourist friendly, people friendly, unlike Japan."
163,5.0,"I think using Seoul Metro to move around is the best way to visit different destinations for tourists, it is so easy to use and we did download the app to help us travelling too. Buy a T money card in any convenience store (3000 won normal design and 4000 - 5000 won for special characters) and top up with some amount ( you can make payments for other purchases too not necessary only pay for transportation) 1,250 won for each trip, you can travel to any stations, not sure if there are different charges in different line, with our experience, 4 - 10+ stations we only paid for 1,250 round trip per person. It is consider very cheap compare to HK MTR or Japan side."
164,5.0,"I'm from the USA; I find it easier to navigate Seoul Subway System than NYC or D.C.Pros:  Clean, quiet, easy/simple to follow; multi-language signs (usually Hangul, English, and Chinese); cellphone apps make it very easy (I use MetroidHD since I travel between Seoul, Daegu, and Busan); shopping in the underground---oh my!!!; depending on what station you go through the food is good (Jamsil station has a real Krispy Kreme where you can see and get donuts actually coming out of the fryer and glazer); heated seats on the trains in the winter time; modernCons:  It will get crowded during rush hour.  You may get nudged or slightly pushed.  Do not take this as rudeness; it is just a part of life in Seoul. Hints:  Get a T-money card to ride the subway system (you can also use these in most taxis in Seoul.  Not all Line 1 trains go all the way to Bosan and Dongducheon.  Some will have end of the line at Uijeongbu or other Nowon-Gu area stops.  Use an app like MetroidHD to let you know when you will do transfers and at what stations you will change trains.  Don't sit in the elderly, pregnant, or handicap spaces unless you are old, with child, or disabled...it's culturally sensitive and it's the right thing to do."
165,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is very convenient and inexpensive way to get around Seoul. Trains and stations are very modern, well-lit and clean. The stations and trains are quite spacious and less crowded compared to other large cities. My only negative is that the Station signs are hard to see from within the train, due signage affixed to the train windows. Also, the direction of the train was sometimes a bit difficult to decipher. Usually the direction can be determined by the end station name, but this was not clear to me on some lines. Announcements are in Korean, English and Mandarin."
166,4.0,The subway and the trains are very clean. Toilets are also clean. We are with our kids who are tech savvy so we did not have problems navigating the subway as well as in getting tickets (reloadable cards). Also very safe. No pickpockets unlike notorious Paris. Thank God!
167,4.0,Seoul metro is good but unfortunately not every station friendly for wheelchair. The sign is minimun so we must ask a few times to get the lift
168,5.0,"We felt very safe to use the Seoul metro. It is extremely clean, well indicated & easy to use.However do not be surprised to be pushed by locals to get in & out! It is each to their own - no politeness there! If they could, they would climb over you before letting anyone out first 😂"
169,5.0,Most of the time...the only logical way to get around Seoul. Get a Tmoney card too make it even easier.
170,4.0,"Overall the metro system in Seoul deserve a 5 star rating, It is very clean, spacious and well control temperature, but I am giving it 4, because I think the Seoul rider do need to learn more from Japanese in term of courtesy.In the metro system, you keep hearing the broadcast in few languages keep on remind the rider to give up seat for old people, disable people, pregnant lady, or even for those pregnant but not too visible.It tells how 'well"" behave their rider are.Personal experience ? On line 2 we are riding during the rush hour, and its our station to exit, We cant make our way out, and we are with 2 toddlers, and still they wont let us exit the metro, So the only thing I can do is to push my way out... This never happened to us in Japan.If you recall the sardine video clip of Tokyo metro ? well...my family still able to exit any metro during such situation because they all make way for people to exit no matter how pack is the rider on that train.Line is a city loop train, what I think the time to ride a circle is taking little too long, maybe they can look into it to make it more efficient."
171,5.0,"I think the Seoul Metro is one of the better metros in Asia. I haven't been on the Tokyo one in 10 years, so I cannot compare, but I do remember that the distinguishing factor for Seoul's is that not only do they have English for every stop, but sometimes even in Chinese and Japanese.  I didn't see that all the time in Japan nor any other Asian country.  Hong Kong just has Chinese and English, for the most part."
172,5.0,"I got the long distance Metro and Train ticket thru online before i traveled to Seoul.  Once arrived Incheon Airport, head to catch the Arex Airport Express Train to Seoul KTX Train Station and to Busan.  Once in Seoul City, you merely head to the nearest Metro station to buy ticket to travel to those landmarks of your interest."
173,5.0,Crisscrossing the entire country the excellent labrynthine train system can get u anywhere abd the best part is it is almost 100%relianke and on time .Best way to neat the traffic too and plenty of shopping to distract you in the stations ..so make sure u domt miss ur train as they are alwats on time .Do t know korean..no problem info desks everywhere and even the computer ticketting kiosks have english  translation and In train announcements are made in English too.
174,4.0,Seoul metro is one of the most extensive network in the world connecting not only Seoul center but also its suburb areas. It was on time and very efficient that you don't need a taxi to go any places in Seoul. The only lacking of Seoul metro is no air conditioned at all stations and the interval sometimes quite long.
175,5.0,"Spent 4 days in Seoul travelling on the Metro. No long waits, plenty of space on the trains, stations are close to places you'll want to go. Toilets and water refill stations everywhere, information people are available, knowledgeable and helpful, with good English. The only problem we ever had was trying to find a specific exit in Seoul Station (there are 15 subway exits and 4 station exits) for a tour pickup, but that was quickly sorted when I stopped trying to find it and asked at the information desk."
176,2.0,Big challenge for tourist like me carry large luggage travel by Seoul Metro. Long walking distance with stairs when trtansfering from one line to another. Hardly find any escalator or lift when using Seoul Metro.
177,5.0,"The subway is perfectly easy to take for a foreigner, there are vending machines that are in english that sell you the ticket - its actually a card you have to keep with you until your exit. All the signs are in English. We even found some volunteer Koreans that were just there to help travelers."
178,5.0,"Excellent way to travel all around Seoul. On time, and very well maintained stations. Modern metro with free wifi."
179,5.0,Easily accessible & fast. Changing from Station to another station was easy. Thumb up for the effectiveness of the Seoul Metro
180,5.0,The Seoul metro is the way to travel in this city. It is fast clean and safe and always on time. Closest comparison is Switzerland!  Only problem is that it can get very crowded at rush hours!
181,5.0,"I really loved how connected all the trains were compared to other places that have different companies/stations. The metro cards were also easy to use and reload. The machines had multiple languages. The trains were fast and you never have to wait long for one to arrive. I also found the platforms really easy to navigate, with English languages, and announcements."
182,5.0,The Seoul Metro is easy to use as everything is written in English. It's also easy to plan your day using this means of transportation. It's so cheap.
183,5.0,Once you get the hang of it the Metro is so easy to use.  Koreans really helpful and willing.  Air conditioned trains a treat.
184,4.0,"You can choose to buy a single trip ticket at the machine or get the T-money, either available at convenience store, machines or at the counter at airport terminal station.Topping up the card is fuss free too, you can choose from English or chinese language and follow the instructions. One improvement to be done is to make the name of the stations more visible, the names of the stations at the end of the lines are included beside the main station and people can get confused which is the station name, It is a good touch that passengers can put their stuff like bags etc up at the metal racks above the seats, if it is too heavy to carry or when the train is crowded. One thing to note is that there are express trains available, I saw it along 1 of the lines at the Express bus terminal, however it can get super packed during peak hours like after work so it is almost impossible to board it. It is time-saving if you are able to board it, as it helps shorten your journey by skipping some of the stations in between. Do download the 'subway' app on your phone as it is handy in telling you the fastest route to get from one station to another and especially if you need to transfer to another line to get to your destination. It is definitely less attention seeking than opening up the tourist map on the train. Do prepare to walk a lot if you need to transfer trains. It is best to prepare a lanyard to hang the T-money around your neck, as you may need to tap the card a few times if you need to transfer trains. The standard fare is 1250 won for shorter journeys and it will be deducted once you tap the card the first time, if your journey is very long, you may need to pay an additional 200 won if I remember correctly when you tap out. Follow the signs in the stations and you will not get lost even if you need to transfer to another train at another line."
185,4.0,Going around Seoul is quite easy using the seoul metro. Must obtain T-money card at the airport which will be use as trains fare. You can easily reload it in every station. interval of trains is just 2-3 mins. Train was also very clean. Dont forget to download seoul metro’s station line Map.
186,4.0,"Korean Subway is very effectives and clean. But to me is hard for me not understanding Korean word, even thought it have Chinese Wording I still find it hard to understand how the subway is operate. And the description on the apps or maps doesn’t match some of it. Like said transfer within 3 mins but it doesn’t really 3mins"
187,4.0,"A good way to go around in a city when you are a tourist is by using the public transportation. I think that in Seoul city taxis can be expensive and buses are good but maybe not as fast as the Subway, that's why I'm going to recommend you to use the subway if you are planning a trip in Seoul city. Two things that you have to consider before heading to the nearest subway station are: buying a T-Money card which you can find at the convenience stores and downloading the Seoul subway metro app.The T-Money card is a public transportation card that can be used in Buses and subways in the metropolitan cities in South Korea, you can find these transportation cards in retail stores like GS25, CU, 7-Eleven, Ministop and more. How to use it? well, first you have to add balance to the card, ask the staff of the retail shop where you bought the card to please charge your card with money. secondly, once in the subway station, you have to tap your card on the sensor located on top of the subway turnstile until it beeps. The sensor will display the amount charged on the top and the remaining balance at the bottom. Please remember that you also have to tap your card before going out of the subway station.About the Seoul City metro app. This is a very handy app if you are in Seoul because this app will provide you with the Subway map of Seoul city. You can plan your route by double tapping on the subways stations, the app will aloud you to select the departing and place of arrival and will also let you see the timetables of the train you are about to aboard. The User Interface of this app is friendly and you can find it in both, Korean and English language. You will also see the subway maps in the subway stations and inside the trains as well or you can get one of this maps in your hotel and at the touristic information centers in Seoul.all in all, I think that by using the Seoul city metro you can save time and money, and since the trains are clean and equipped with air conditioner during the summer and heaters during the winter you can make your trip more pleasant. I also have to add that most of the hot places in Seoul like shopping malls, markets, stadiums, museums, parks, palaces, and universities are designated with at least one subway station, this really makes it easy to get to your destination of preference."
188,5.0,"The transport system is efficient and clean. I used Citymapper to choose routes, which was great. My suggestion would be to allow credit card payment in addition to the travel card required. Eg. In London UK there is a travel card option and credit card option for payment"
189,4.0,Seoul meyro is the easiest way to get around the city. Get a T money card from any convenience store or eben at the station amd you are ready to go. We were 3 people so many times it was almost the same as taking a taxi and we ended up using taxis more.
190,4.0,"I've used the Seoul Metro on all of my previous visits to the city, and have always found it to be a much appreciated convenience and a good value. The signage--in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and English--is well-placed and helpful."
191,5.0,"Easy to use, Suggest you buy the T-money card in one of the seven eleven / vending machine near stations"
192,5.0,Seoul metro is easy to understand and includes all sraff to make you trip safe and pleasurable.It has restroom in every station that I visited))It has different price plans both for kids and adults and locals and tourists.It has safe glass that protect people from falling down to rails.
193,5.0,"The metro is a great way to get around and we found the service to be one of the best we have encountered in any major city. Not only is it easy to navigate, it is also very reasonable to traverse the city price-wise. From our experience, unless you plan to do at least 15 journeys a day, you may be better off buying single tickets than multiple day passes. Chances are that you would visit say, 5 or 6 tourist places a day at the most and then go out to dinner in the evening. When you pay for your ticket, there is a deposit automatically included which you get back from the machines at your destination station."
194,3.0,"Very clean and safe subway. Much smoother ride than anything in the States. No rats, crack heads, cockroaches, or people trying to rob you.Very sweaty, humid, and crammed. Survival of the fittest or most cunning. Don't expect politeness on the subway. There could be a pregnant woman barfing with water breaking and there would still be drunk men sitting in the pregnancy seats, or girls doing makeup. If you're too slow someone might push you away or throw their bag on a seat to claim it. Expect people to point at you and talk about you, whisper, laugh, mock....(if you're a foreigner) also, it's funny when they slam tackle each other to get a seat and then nobody sits by the foreigner.The subway itself is great though. Try to find the sections on the ends if you seek something cooler. If you seek a sauna swampass torture chamber, then ride in the middle sections--- either way, from September - June, the subway is a humid death box. If you like heat then you'll love this subway. Take a towel. I use my credit cards to scrape sweat from my body. The locals don't seem to mind. It could be 1000 billion degrees in September and the AC would be off. But, the safety and the cleanliness are nice. Also--- Koreans (usually older) think it is ok to touch your baby. The younger generation has more manners. If you want someone to stop trying to rub your child's face..... Say, ""Ha-jee-ma."" That means don't do that."
195,5.0,"Great system, easy to use, staff at stations too very helpful. And lots of shopping and restaurants in the system"
196,4.0,The system is safe and easy to use apart from the ticketing system which is over complicated where you have to buy a ticket and have to insert it into a machine at the end of your journey to get a partial refund on your fare.
197,4.0,"The Seoul Metro has an extensive network, which connects to almost the whole of Seoul.  The stations and trains are very clean and well maintained.Some stations are very huge, and they lacked English signs, so it us some time to find the correct entrance to the platforms."
198,5.0,Seoul has the best subway I have ever ridden. It is air conditioned and spotless. Very easy to read maps and people in the stations who can help you navigate the system. Everyone in Seoul is friendly and eager to help visitors.
199,3.0,"The Metro is an acceptable mode of transportation for tourists and citizens alike. It doesn't have a heads up display where you can view the station in English, only a board with lights, so it is difficult to see which station you are going to. Tickets are of reasonable price, the train gets you to the station fast enough but stairs is a problem."
200,5.0,"After several trips to Seoul for beauty products haul, this trip wanted to explore the other parts of Seoul from Gangnam, Insadong, Hongdae and others so decided to buy a top up metro card.Super convenient with all machine having English guide and going in and out are super efficient. Trains are clean and well maintained and covers the whole of Seoul. You can choose between per trip, top up card and tourist pass.I chose the top up card (3500 Korean won). Bought the pair KAKAO card (you keep the card and can be used in the future as you keep topping up. This is the cheapest and fastest form to get around Seoul.Safety in Korea is also extremely good which makes exploring fun and great."
201,5.0,"The metro is amazing. We no Korean language skills to speak of, we got everywhere we needed to be. The system is color coded and every station is numbered."
202,4.0,"Great system, frequent trains, easy to access stations, convenient with the prepaid card that can be used throughout Korea. Be sure to purchase the youth cards for kids 18 and under. It would be nice if the metro maps available at the airports and the hotels are printed larger and more legible for ease of reference.   Much needed in Korea since few speak English, and stations are not staffed."
203,5.0,"If you take a little time to learn the subway system, you will be rewarded many times over. My sons took a taxi after the Metro map showed their route would take 30 minutes. The taxi took 45 as it turned out. And the cost was four times as much as the subway."
204,4.0,The seoul metro is very convinient and easy to understand. We can buy t money to get cheaper ticket fee
205,4.0,"Might be a bit packed when it is time for the locals to get off from work. The interval from one train to another is 3-5 minutes. And if you hungry, you can grab some snacks, there's a lot of food stall inside the train station. Some even got to shop various kind of things there like clothes, kpop idol pillowcase, cosmetics, etc"
206,5.0,Really easy to get around on.  Be prepared to stand unless you have young children or older adults in your party where you'll usually be offered a seat. Signs are in English as well as the little tunes they use to signify a transfer station or the end of the line. It's cheap too!!Buses were quick to start and stop so be sure to hold on tight!!
207,5.0,"Metro is easy to use.  Lots of maps and signs to help you find the correct train.  All signs and announcements are in English.  My family, of four, purchased the tourist money card at the airport.  One card gives you 20 rides per day for a set price.  Not sure if it saves money but it's super convenient not to have to purchase single ride tickets every time. You also receive deposit back once the card is returned."
208,5.0,Seoul metro is the cleanest and simplest metro I've ever seen. I use the subway app which is perfect with the Transit money card. I don't have to constantly buy one way tickets.
209,5.0,"There are many modes of transport in Seoul but by far the best way is the metro.from the airport i took a taxi which cost me 77;000 wan,to myongdong.from there everything is within an army throw.i was at hotel Staz 1:a 5minute walk to myongdong main market,10,minutes to insadong and dangdemoun.namdemoun market another ten minutes,but to get to hong de and itewan I used the metro.best buy a t card from any 7/11 store which costs 2500 wan then top it up as you go along,I topped it up with 10,000 wan and it lasted 4 days.then it’s easier to just come and go as opposed to buying a ticket every time..the metro here is a little bit more complicated than shanghai,but still easy once you get the hang of it,just beware that there are many exits from any station you use so know which exit takes you where."
210,5.0,"very efficient, very clean, fast, all stations had very clear signboards in English and Korean language, transfers were clearly marked. loved travelling in the subway."
211,5.0,I used the bus and train systems when in Seoul and they were great the T card system is perfect to help you also the trains are clean and come every couple of minutes.Just about most things are easy to get to by train.
212,5.0,Easy to navigate and a great way to explore the city! You can access most tourist attractions through the subway.
213,5.0,"This is the first vehicle to travel around in Seoul.Since lines have been expanded gradually, it may require walking long and deep downward sometimes.- Great view when it passes Han River.- Transfer stations and stations at office areas are so crowded during 07:00~09:00 and 18:00~. Sindorim, Gangnam, etc.- There are some stations with underground malls such as Gangnam and Express Bus Terminal.- Sinimun Station is still looking old.- Beotigogae Station has a funicular.- Noksapyeong Station is deep and gorgeous.- Some stations are changing names lately for reasons.- There are stations that are actually far from station names. Seoul University for instance.- Announcement in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese."
214,5.0,"Seoul subway is the most reliable, fast and safe public transportation that i ever rode (same goes for the buses). The subway stations and the subway itself are always immaculate. Signs are in Korean and  English. Some subway stations are like micro cities. They are huge and you can find a bit of everything there (restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets, clothes and shoe shops to name a few) you will also find hot and cold vending machines in most of them. Each destination has a number and a color associated to it. Get a subway map. It will help you a lot.The metro stops are announced in Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese. You have WiFi inside the subway and air conditioned (during summer).The metro also goes way further from Seoul outskirts. If you plan to visit Suwon and you can't or don't want to drive, take the metro (around 1h. Stops everywhere.), or train (around 35 minutes.) or KTX (around 25 minutes). After that you hop on a bus that you will drop you at Suwon Fortress after a 15 minutes ride.It is also the main place where you will find some trash bins (you won't see any on the streets so always carry a bag with you). If you think you might be lost or you can't find the exit or any signs nearby, just look at the floor. In some places they have signs indicating which direction to follow for the exit or indicating the names of the area of the city you will be depending on the turn you choose to follow. (Check my photos for you to have an idea how they look like)You have ticket vending machines near every entrance. Get a T-money card, recharge it and go forth into adventure ;)"
215,5.0,"easy to read and buy ticket and cheap, since it has english and other languages. accessible basically anywhere you want to go."
216,5.0,I found this system very easy to use and station staff spoke English and were always eager to help.    I bough a card for the system at a 711. The signed are in English with maps that were easy to follow.
217,4.0,We used the metro to get around one day.  it looks easier than it is.  We asked lots of questions and finally got to were we wanted to be.  The maps are easier than the trains themselves.
218,5.0,LOVED this for my family of 6. It takes awhile to walk everywhere but it's a must in this huge city.
219,5.0,The Seoul Metro system is excellent. Very reliable and on time.  I look forward to ride the metro and get to my next destination.
220,4.0,The Korean subway is more like Singapore MRT. The cleanliness in the train and even the toilet are the plus point of the Seoul Metro. Also the schedule of train is punctual and the maps for the subway is easy. The fee for traveling using subway is cheap rather than in other countries.
221,5.0,Subway amazing as always. Nice and clean and easy to use once you ride a few times. The metro is also very inexpensive...you can travel all over Seoul for 10 days for avout 20 000₩
222,5.0,"The system with clear signs is simple to learn, as well as the lines with numbered stations. Vending machines at stations are easy to operate, quite simple to add value on a travel card - which may not be shaped like a card. Trains vary from ultra modern to older versions. Worth taking the lines which cross the river, views are good. Changing lines may mean long walks and plenty of steps, and especially older stations have often quite hidden their elevators. Stations have all necessary and some unnecessary shops and booths. It is quite humorous to notice when you are the only passenger without your nose in your mobile - but it is also a way to keep feeling of privacy in a crowded space, like turning your face towards the wall/door when standing. Locals are very snappy to exchange seats when they see mother and child separated in a full car, just love it :)"
223,5.0,"Definitely the preferred way of travel in Seoul as the city can be confusing and the traffic may make taxi a less favorable option.  I suggest using a Seoul Subway app to help you plot and navigate from point to point.  Note not all the lines have interconnecting stations just because they intercept so beware, and even the stations that allows transferring of lines the walking distance may be substantial for elderly or family with small kids.I would say if you have family or group of 4 or more, then taxi may be an option.  Seoul subway isn't too cheap.  A taxi start off at 3000 won and unless you're really going out of town most places can be reached at 5000 won or less.  I am traveling with family of 5 (2 kids, 1 infant no ticket) and I find myself even the shortest trip is 7500 won (after refund).  For us taxi is actually the cheapest option for most of our destinations.  But if you have group of 3 or less, then definitely subway."
224,5.0,"Easy to connect, clean & convenient. It is always busy & but not confused. Look at the map & ask, locals are very nice & kind...."
225,4.0,Me and my family started using the subway on our first day in Seoul and we quickly learned how to get around using local transportation. Very easy to use with a T-money-card. The subway-trains feels spacious and ”safe” due to the glass-Wall/doors between the track/train and the platform. Everything is written in both english and korean which makes also makes it easy for foreigners :).
226,5.0,"Easy access, everything is written in English so there is no way to get lost if you know the transportation system. Bonus point: Wifi available pretty much everywhere"
227,4.0,I counted about 10 different lines.It is a complex web that seem to be able to get you anywhere in Seoul. It's efficient and relatively clean- comparable to all the major city grid systems in the world.
228,5.0,"We rode the subway for part of our adventure today & I can truly say it was a plesant experience. There was no trash laying anywhere on the trains, no graffiti & best of all no loud cell phone conversations. Everyone had earbuds to listen to whatever they were watching/playing on their phones. Stops were announced in English too. We loved it."
229,5.0,"The metro is clean, very safe, fast, organized, reliable and cheap. After one day using the metro, we were able to get around the city fast and visit so many places without any problems."
230,4.0,"Seoul metro is comfortable. Its really big and it has lots of exit. There are big metro stations like Seoul Station or City Hall. Also there are small metro stations like Oido Station. There 8 or 9 lines. There are clean restrooms, some convenient stores and different shops or small cafes. Seul metrosunun kullanımı rahat. Bayağı büyük ve çok çıkışı var. İstasyonlarda temiz tuvaletler ve çeşitli mağazalar bulmak mümkün. Seul ziyaretçilerinin kullanabileceği en uygun ulaşım sistemi."
231,5.0,A well commuting system high tech.You could get easy to any place Don't even think about - taxis could be hard becuase language barriers.In your next trip to Seoul just download Citymapper from your app store and enjoy traveling as quick as possible.
232,4.0,"the subway in seoul is great very vast, the rate is much cheaper than taxis, getting a t money card helps save a lot of time and effort. the  trains are clean and fast. only thing i found strange was the trains are not constant there are times we waitied a good 5 minutes and other times even more..."
233,5.0,"Least expensive and best way to travel.  There are maps for all languages. If you can't figure out the maps, many locals are willing to stop and help you. :)"
234,5.0,The best way to travel. The instructions are clear. Just need to know your destination and you'll be fine...
235,4.0,"To to navigate and brings you to most of the popular locations without too much complications. The signs could be better for foreigners. Obviously the cheapest way to get around and made easier with map apps, especially NAVER."
236,5.0,We used the metro every day.  Easy to use and very clean.  Best way to travel in Seoul.  Even those who know absolutely no Korean.
237,2.0,Tmoney card is not refundable when you leave Korea.  It costs 4000won just for the card itself.  You need to top up for your travel fares.  Seoul Metro is not user friendly with limited english or chinese words on it.  The staff sitting in i counter is not helpful as they dont speak english.  You need to study the metro map by yourself the night before you travel.
238,5.0,"very lovely experiance with metro, you will see lovely views, but dont inter the metro after 5:30 - antil 7 Congestion time"
239,5.0,"Most convenience way to travel in Seoul is by train. Just get your T money card at convenience store and start using it for train, buses and taxi. The actraction are able to be visited by all these mode of transportation."
240,5.0,"Unlike what i saw on travel show that said the metro was confusing, i find it neat and easy to navigate. Highly recommended"
241,5.0,"Just don't understand way people drive here when its got the best public transportation system. Super efficient, cheap at about a buck and clean and stations everywhere, its the best way to get around Seoul. One drawback, it doesn't operate between midnight and 6am. Kinda a weird for a city that doesn't sleep. Tip: download Kakao Metro."
242,5.0,"Clean, convenient, and cheap! We bought the 72 hour pass available to foreigners, and it  really paid off! We had 5 of us in our party, and used it all the time. It's super easy to navigate, all signs are in English, the trains were clean and on time and the stations were SPOTLESS. Highly recommend!"
243,5.0,"lived in myeongdong on vacation and had access to several metro lines. They are cheap, reliable, efficient with announcements in English as well and was the best way to get around the city unless your legs are tired. A tourist lifeline."
244,5.0,"Cheap and fast but it can be confusing at first because of the numerous transfers.  Make sure you snap a photo of the subway lines for ease of travelling.  While transfers are made easier if you go by colour, it can be confusing when you have to decide if you should be travelling on this side or the opposite side of the platform.  Long walks if you go to the wrong/opposite platform."
245,5.0,Friendly young subway 'ambassadors' are there to assist tourists with purchasing tickets and directions...  Inexpensive way to travel around Seoul
246,4.0,The Seoul Metro or Korail is one of the most practical public transportation in Seoul. You can get to anywhere in Seoul and the vicinities. It’s average speed is 50km/h.
247,5.0,"The best way to get in and out of Seoul is by metro since i dont yet the bus routes. But beware of the splitting subway lines, there were times i thought it would be a straight journey esp going to Bupyeong area rather it goes to Sinchang the othe end of the subway.  It cost 1250won for a sinle travel plus the metro card worth 3000won (not refundable) so we can save money by just reloading.  I guess there will additional 100 up to 300 tranferring to other lines.  I regretted using limo taxi from airport to Seollung,as it was too expensive $110 plus the driver is asking for more, since i dont know Seoul yet when we arrived. We saved money by using metro going back to airport, i think only 1500won (1.5$) each from Bupyeong area and it was a lot faster."
248,5.0,"Seoul is the most convenient place to travel in. It's safe and easy. We used Naver App to navigate our way around. This included the train and buses options. We enjoyed taking the Metro, specially with LTE wifi, even underground."
249,4.0,"Very comprehensive guide maps at the stations. Gets you everywhere in the city. But could be very busy during peak hours. Also, transferring from one line to another  requires a lot of walking...up and down stairs...with escalators only at small sections. Good workout if you're into the 10,000 steps a day routine. Not good if you have a problem with your knees"
250,5.0,"I have traveled to many cites around the world.  This is one of the better metros.  Extensive routes.  Easy to use, once you get yourself oriented to the map.  Recommend getting a T money card (tap and go) from a convenient store (which is on every block) and top off in small amounts as you go."
251,5.0,"If you want a cheap, efficient and clean way to travel, make use of the Seoul subways. There are nine private lines which enable a person to travel long distances cheaply and quickly. Each subway door is marked on the platform to enable a person to choose the correct exit. Presto cards are used to enter and exit the subway. Machines to refill your cards are at each entrance/exit. As well, these cards can be used to pay for taxis and buss. Wi-fi is available on all subways."
252,4.0,"Kudos to Seoul Metro for a very efficient, on time, and stress free travel within Seoul Metropolis Area. It's the best metro experience I've ever had in my life!!! I could simply say a WOW!!!"
253,4.0,It’s not the cheapest metro system at KRW 1250 per ride but it takes you to many important places and connects to the KTX via Yongsan or Seoul seamlessly.We took the metro everyday and did not have any issues. Buying a T card makes it very hassle free too.
254,5.0,This is really the best transit system in the world. Can go everywhere in subway or bus with very cheap fare using T money.
255,5.0,Seoul metro has clear direction in English. Ticket machine also has English direction. Some stations are crowded.
256,5.0,"Wouldn’t try it if the taxi driver wasn’t asking 70,000 won fare from Myeondong to Hongdae lol! Tourist have to be smart and know the price of everything (most of it) coz some are testing if you will fall from it. Tanx to my accommodation host for guiding us, detail by detail, we managed to get back to his place safe and not to mention saved alot. There metro is easy to understand, they have different language that you can choose, and there are english signs everywhere, there’s no way you will get lost."
257,5.0,"Ever since I start travelling to another country I always preferred to use subway. I’m a type of person, if the country has good climate, clean and organised, and safe, I’m down to use public transportation. Plus challenging because you get to see how far you can go using thing that you do not know. And cabs are always easy to find, anywhere. I want to have the option for “what if”.(“What if:” there’s no cab, or I need to get there on time and it’s traffic?” Or I’m on a budget I don’t like to use cab because it’s expensive.)All of these answered by a subway. You just have to download Seoul and busan subway map. (If you just plan to go to busan) or vice versa. Plus here’s the reason why I chose this transportation:1. It’s cost efficient2. Less hassle3. Easy to navigate4. Fast5. ReliableI don’t opt to use bus for most of my travels because I have dizziness every time I used that kind of transportation. I don’t like taking anti-vertigo tablet because the side effect is I’m sleepy. ( not good for touring) but if you prefer the bus its near to every subways stations. Specially here in Seoul, I recommend using subway, if you want to maximise your stay in Korea. Use them. It’s no traffic, of course unlike taking a bus. Plus transferring to color pattern stations is way too far if you use buses. Literally you count kilometers, specially on rush hour day. Buying a T-money card is advisable if you stay in Seoul for more than 2 days, you get discount instead of buying per day ticket. Plus you can use this card to almost anywhere, from subway to bus, to some of the taxis, to busan metro/subway, convenience stores. We got ours from convenient store located in subway airport. Please do note that some of the designs are in need to be activate at the information booth even when you top it up (load-up) That what happens to us, when we bought the “line friends” T-money card, (yes I’m a fan!) Well, even though the staffs at convenient store tried their best to help us, walked with us all the way thru entry gate, it did not push through, they ask help thru “help button” at subway but I just don’t know why it didn’t work. So I decided to go to information, and that’s it, all it needs is to scan our cards and we’re good to go. Also design cards is a 1,000 - 2,000 won higher than classic ones. Be mindful. I bought ours for 4,000.00 won/each (no top up) Classics designs is the violet card. My son lost his first t-money, so I bought a new one, I just accidentally picked this one because we are in a hurry taking a subway, that time is already 11:30pm/ subway is until 12am. Anyway bought it for 3,000.00 won/plus top up. And need not to be activated since it’s automatic. I think k-pop designs are much higher depends on in-demand group."
258,5.0,We had a 48h Discover Seoul pass which gave us unlimited use of the metro station. It was fairly easy to get around as long as you had an idea of which lines you needed to get to. We usually just followed the coloured signs to get to the right platform. Try to remember the station name after the one you are on so you can figure out which train to take and if you're going in the right direction. Most of the stations have small underground malls nearby which has places to buy souvenirs or food.
259,3.0,"It's qutie easy to take the metro in Seoul and you can easily access to anywhere by metro. My friend recommend an apps (Subway) on phone that make it much easier.  You can input the depart and arrive station and it'll tell you how you can get there from the shortest line.The only thing bad about taking metro is the stairs, you can't really find escalator or lift.  My mum's legs are not too strong to take the stairs but most of the entrance/exit are only with stairs.  Even you can find the escalator or lift, it might take a big route for you to get to the place you are going as the exit are not the nearest to your destination.Those who are bringing elderly that are not able to take the stairs, I would suggest to take taxi as it's not too expensive if you have a party of 4 and the distance is not too far.  Sometimes taking taxi will be even cheaper as compare to taking metro."
260,5.0,"For all of us non-Korean speakers, you can find metro maps in English at tourist centers and not in the metro stations."
261,3.0,"I was surprised, everything in Korea seems so advance except the metro. Long walk in between stations and not easy access with a stroller."
262,5.0,"One of the most convenient and useful transportation systems of the world. Even if the main lines are a bit old, the government keeps making a huge effort to provide the best quality system and to supply the needs of the locals and expats~"
263,4.0,"Used this rail network for a week to get around the city and attractions within Seoul. Don’t be surprised that it is normal see young and old literally running or dashing for the trains. Most stations have escalators and some even have travellators. The lifts are strictly for old folks and handicapped. It is difficult to spot a person on wheelchair, understandably that it is hard for them to move around the stations and commuters won’t care for their disadvantage. Local commuters have had the same habit of standing abreast the train’s doorway just like that i observed in Beijing rail network. Other than that, the metro rail is efficient and clean"
264,4.0,"Ticket price reasonable, easier to read routes compared to Tokyo. The fares are cheap like $1.25. There were 5 of us so nearby destinations, we like to use the taxi versus paying 1.25 each for train. If you don’t have the T money card, it’s okay. You can pay per destination, don’t forget to return your ticket for a deposit redund of 500won which is 50cents."
265,5.0,"Although it doesn’t operate as fast and as efficient as Shanghai metro, Seoul metro is a life saver. Easy to use and has facilities underground from cake shops to money changer. No one needs taxi in Seoul"
266,4.0,"Easy, reliable and many stops that make it very convenient for us to move around in Seoul.  Although the trains are packed during their peak hours but don't need to wait long for the next one to come.  Since this is our fourth time in Seoul, very pleased to mention that their good service level maintained the same.The only drawback is that some of the stations do not provide escalator/elevator which makes it a bit difficult for us to carry our big luggage upon arrival and departure especially when we have to take few levels up/down."

274,5.0,"We used the Metro everyday to get around Seoul.  Really enjoyed the convenience, cleanliness, and affordability."
275,5.0,The Seoul Metro is laid out just like the subway systems in many other large metropolitan areas. Multiple lines run in various directions across the city making it easy to get just about anywhere. Trains are frequent and fast and transfer is easy between lines. There are maps at each stop of the neighborhood and of the metro system making it easy to find the next stop or destination. A map of the exits directs passengers to the appropriate street up above. It's best to buy a multi-day Korail pass if you plan on using it more than once. You can reload the pass using the machines adjacent to the entrance to the lines. Just scan the card on entry and exit and you're good to go. Passengers on the train are overall quiet and courteous. In our experience it was faster to ride the subway than to sit in the traffic up above in an overheated taxi.
276,5.0,I rode on the weekend so was not really busy.  A little shocking for a North American to see gas masks in the subway but many lines that get you anywhere.  A lot of stairs and walking so might be difficult for the elderly. Seoul seems like a city made for the young

Trips cost 1,450 Won, you can get a T-Pass which works out cheaper as you just top up the card and also M-Pass is available which gives unlimited journeys for specific number of days. If getting a single journey when you leave your destination station find a deposit return machine and you will get 500 Won back for your card. Ticket machines have an English option and stations are marked in English on the maps and signs and also announcements on trains are given in English.Stations are quite large and if changing lines you may find you need to do a lot of walking. If you are going somewhere specific try to find out the exit number as most of the stations are vast so you need to make sure you have the right exit. Toilets in the stations are spotless and you feel extremely safe travelling."

286,5.0,"Our group used the metro system every possible chance. Acquiring the tickets at the kiosks was challenging at times due to not having exact change or bills too large. Not all machines were credit card friendly. The maps on the trains and the signage was easy to navigate-OH and the shopping is wonderful as you are walking through to tunnels to the trains! Very clean, please remember to give your seat to an older person, this is customary. Enjoy your travels!"

291,4.0,"Seoul Metro was efficient,clean and well connected easy access to most attractions.The small setbacks was some stations doesn't have lifts and escalators. Its quite a challenge for tourists with luggages and elderly people.Then also there's no one mending the stations exits and need to press some button at exit gates to speak to someone that doesn't speak English.Those going for the first time and doesn't speak Korean should download the English version Seoul Metro map or live App."
292,5.0,"We would take the train from Sendorim station which was not far from our hotel for our trips to downtown which was only 15 minutes travel.  The trains were roomy, clean and very efficient.

294,5.0,"Arriving in Korea Airport, the metro was our transportation to get out, going to Gyeounggong. This train was on time, and fast. It was clean and had a lady that goes around and take your tickets. She is like a stewardess on a train. You can look around while sitting there til you get to your destination. If you drive a car you will not see the view around you."
