We were not even allowed to slow down, but had to drive by at regular speed. The pics were got were not worth posting. Guards everywhere.  A bit disappointed, but understand that all cultures have rules. So I will just continue to look at it in the dramas. It was still good get a glimpse of other countries operate."
1,3.0,"Remember to book the visit in advance (at least 2 months in my case). On the day of the visit you have to go to the Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å area to take a bus that will take you to the Blue House. You get a mug as a gift.I‚Äôd advise to go there in spring/summer. I went there in February and there really wasn‚Äôt anything interesting to see. The tour is watching some short video, then walking around the park and buildings. Wouldn‚Äôt go there again."
2,4.0,Please book in advance and I suggest weekdays visits (tuesday-Friday) as Saturday visits (2nd and 4th) are full of families. Please follow the instructions ie don‚Äôt take photos in places that you are not supposed to. Given a nice mug as souvenir. Remember to bring your passport.
3,5.0,"This palace is very strictly guarded by presidential security staff. So you can going inside the palace by registering at their website. Not every time you can joins this tour. You must choose the date & time you wants to join, at least 1 month before the date & time you choose, because visitor from another country are being minimalized. Don't forget to came early (at least 1 hour before your tour) because you must re-registered yourself with your email confirmation & passport at bus parking area at Gyeongbokgung Palace. Please wait on the line, because visitors with their guided tour (from China & Korea) are extremely huge. The staff will be calling your name & you must going inside the bus which will brought you inside the palace. After get off from the bus, you will through security check, gets ID card & translator machine (if you're from outside Korea) & going inside the auditorium to listens some opening speech from the staff. After that, you will going outside the auditorium & the staff will be brought you around the palace & you'll get mineral water & free souvenir too (pouch for adults & mini globe for childrens). Yeayy!! After the tour ends, they will brought you back to the bus parking area at Gyengbokgung."
4,3.0,"This was an outside tour of the grounds only - we could not go inside any of the buildings.  I had to register online in advance of my visit and supply my passport number.  On the day of the tour, I went to the meeting spot at Gyeongbokgung Palace, where the tour buses were.  My passport was checked there and then we took the bus to Cheong Wa Dae.  There, we went through security and our passports were checked again.  This is also when you can pick up a headset to listen to the tour in  English.  We walked around the grounds and were able to take photos in designated spots only.  We were not allowed in any of the buildings.  There were some school kids on a field trip in our group, so it was a pretty noisy group to be with.I enjoyed the tour, but truthfully was a bit disappointed in what the tour actually consisted of.  I didn‚Äôt feel like it was anything soecial, considering we had to book well in advance to attend.  Each visitor did receive a free Cheong Wa Dae coffee mug as a gift, which I thought was nice.  All-in-all, if you are on a tight time schedule, this is probably something you can take off your list of must-see places."
5,3.0,"We walked along the palace to see this place.  There was a lot of security along the street.  We can see the Presidential palace from a distance; but at lease, 10 times closer than the same view for the White House.  Surprisingly, the security guard helped us take our pictures."
6,2.0,"This tour was a bit of a disappointment to our group. The group was full of small children who were on field trips, and though somewhat well-behaved - they were still annoying. Especially since the reservation system makes it seem like it's a much smaller group that will be going. This tour is also not a tour of the Blue House, but is only a walking tour of the grounds. For all of the security checks and reservations that you have to go through - might as well just go to a park if you want to see green spaces as there isn't much else on offer for this tour than just that. The foreign language tours are offered only through headsets with recordings. One member our group had the battery die on his while we were on the tour and the staff just kind of shrugged and said they couldn't do anything to help with the problem. Overall, I would advise people to not waste their time with this tour."
7,4.0,"We stopped at the Blue House for a photo opportunity on a guided tour with Koridoor Tours. It is a beautiful place with a very interesting history. We did not get to go on the grounds of the Blue House, but we admired it from several angles and learned a bit about it. This is a great place to see if you are interested in politics, history, architecture, or Korean culture."
8,5.0,You cannot enter the premises without securing an appointment at least three weeks before your preferred schedule. Visit their website (https://english1.president.go.kr/tours) to schedule an appointment. The place is high security and there are certain restrictions i.e there are areas not allowed for picture taking. Big bags are not allowed but there are lockers in the receiving area where you can place your bags. Non-Korean speaking guests will be given a gadget which has a recording of an area's description. You will not be able to enter The Blue House. Photo opts are outside the building only.
9,4.0,Naturally security is high around the palace.  It was good to get a photo however I preferred to go and spend more time in the neighbouring Museum of Folk History rather than do the short tour.
10,4.0,"What a wonderful experience we had at the Cheongwadae(Blue House) which is like the official residence for the Korean President. Beautiful landscape, amazing buildings and macho and good-looking bodyguards that took care of us. What an eye feasting day for me! We also received a good quality souvenir from Blue House. A place worth to visit."
11,5.0,This is the presidential palace of South Korea. It is really nice place. Located after the gyeongbokgung palace.. The blue rooftop can be seen from very far distance.. Lee Min Ho drama City Hunter has been film here..üòÇüòÇüòÇ
12,3.0,"The well-manicured grounds of Cheong Wa Dae was beautiful, especially in autumn. It took us around two months to get a tour spot (free tour). Security was rather tight, and photography was quite restricted (only a few positions, zoom lenses not allowed). Headphones with alternate languages such as English were available free of charge with passport. The tour felt very abbreviated - about 20 minutes."
13,4.0,"(Korean Pronunciation: Cheong Wa Dae. Chinese Characters: ÈùíÁì¶Âè∞Ôºâ. Visited this attraction back in 2014 Summer. Easily accessible via Seoul Subway and must walk a distance. The friendly police forces will be able to guide you in the right direction in English too. I feel that that this presidential residence is set in a beautiful surroundings with hills in the back ground and a fountain in the main square facing the Blue House. There is a musuem whereby visitors can participate in a 3D interactive tour of the Blue House. There is even a replica of the Presidential Desk whereby visitors can sit in it and pose for pictures.Like in other reviews here, you can even take a picture with President Park whereby her image is being digitally ""shopped"" into the picture."
14,5.0,"When we arrived , there were convoy fleet stopping all tourists. Is this place a really working Presidential office or it is just a tourist trick? I am not sure..."
15,3.0,"We got to see it from the distance standing at the designated and naturally heavily guarded spot. The walk from the bus is pleasant. Partly through the park area, near the public relations office, by the allegorical sculptures, street lined with trees - all surrounded by the numerous agents Smiths (matrix). The public relations building houses free Korean culture exhibits, souvenir shop and lounge ( and bathrooms!)."
16,3.0,The area that the blue house is in is really the attraction...not the exuberance of wealthy politicians.Better to simply see it from across the street and hike the surrounding region.
17,3.0,The blue house is always chosen to visit by tour guide because it's free. But i see no special to visit. I stand far from the blue house and stayed about 5 minutes to see it.
18,5.0,"Many may not know that you can actually visit The Blue House but you need to pre-register thru the official website. There's a guided tour to the Blue House where you need to observe and comply to the rules. For foreigners, audio guide will be provided and you just have to press the number accordingly as per the instructions on a note handed to you together with the audio guide. You get a souvenir for joining the tourThe bad thing is you may not know when to press the audio guide for the next narration. For myself, I missed 1 of them and noticed that only until I reached the next one. So look thru the instructions once you receive the audio guide. Note : Photograph is allowed only at specific places."
19,4.0,"The grounds were very beautiful and but, you will not be permitted inside of any buildings at all. I was disappointed by that fact.There were many places you will not be allowed to photograph. I was still glad I went. You will be security scanned. The start point was difficult to find in my opinion. You will have to cue up to get your passport checked and then stand in line to get on a bus to the visitor/welcome center.At the center there are bathrooms to use before the tour starts, as there are no opportunities during. You will be given a video orientation and have headphones for your language to listen to.You will get a great tea cup as a gift when you begin the tour.The presidential museum was a definite plus...you can have your photo taken the with President and his wife! And also in seated at his desk!You have to book months in advance and tours start in June."
