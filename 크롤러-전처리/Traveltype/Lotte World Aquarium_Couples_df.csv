1,4.0,"Went here because we grew tired of walking around shopping and it turned out to be a great place to spend 2h in. The place offers a large variety of sea creatures. You can find belugas, penguins, seals, sting rays + other smaller creatures. Went here during a weekday and there weren’t not many people at all. Very nice and calm atmosphere."
2,5.0,Prepare to be impressed. Much bigger than we thought. The Beluga Whales are a sight to behold. Ready for plenty of pictures and videos.

4,4.0,"Love the experience with the beluga and all other featured species in this aquarium. Also the glass are so clear, it looks as if you are already touching the fish in the aquarium. We just didn't catch any shows here since we first went to Lotte world (amuzement park), and re-entry was not allowed so we had to check out what's there before coming in the aquarium."
5,5.0,"They had several different types of interesting sea animals to see. It is not a huge aquarium like in the states, but for here, I was impressed. They do offer a military discount at the counter. I went around the holidays so it was busier. I would go to lotte world if I had to choose, just because it is bigger. That reference is for the budget people, since both activities are close in price. About $30."

It is very new so everything is still shiny and new, but 2 things really set this one apart for me, the harbour seals and the beluga whales, absolutely amazing! If you are only going to hit one aquarium in Korea, this is the one to hit!"
7,4.0,"This is a great place for visitors of all ages to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day observing marine life. The displays are beautifully clean and well-maintained by the staff. It can be quite crowded, but generally advance tickets are not needed. Crowd control is done pretty effectively by the staff. Our favorite habitats were the beluga whale's and sea lions' areas."
8,5.0,"I love it! It's located inside a huge shopping mall and the aquarium didn't disappoint! There were cute seals swimming in their big aquarium and the beluga whale - my personal favourite - there were 2 of them and they were playing with their toys and seem happy. It's a must visit, great to cool off too. haha"

We figured we would get our hands stamped and check out the Lotte Duty Free and Mall (My wife’s idea lol) and then return to see the Sea Lion and Beluga Whales’ show. To our profound amazement, they wouldn’t stamp our hand so we could return. They spoke decent English for purchasing tickets and for renting the audio guide but all of the sudden, the English proficient customer help didn’t speak a word of English as I tried to get our hands stamped to return. All they could say was they are sorry. Even with listening to the audio guide, the entire trip lasted 2 hours including multiple trips to the restroom by 4 people in a family, snacks such as a pretty decent churro etc… Had we not purchased the rental audio guides, the entire aquarium could be seen in under an hour as it is very tiny. One would think they would give the audio guide for free with the 29,000KRW price but then the audio guide rental is another 3,000KRW a person. Unlike the museums we’ve encountered with children and great teacher supervision, here parents let their children run wild here and even try to push you out of the way to let their children get a view. I could understand a child trying to get a good view and pushing, not having common sense or decency, but a parent pushing you out of the way? That was ridiculous and I surely told the parents to have some civility. What a waste of money and time with the Lotte World Aquarium. If you are considering or contemplating spending your hard earned money on Lotte World Aquarium I strongly advise you spend your money elsewhere and avoid the frustrations my family felt visiting the poorly run Lotte World Aquarium."
