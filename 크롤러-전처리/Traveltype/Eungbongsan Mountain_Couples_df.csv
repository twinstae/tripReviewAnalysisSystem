0,5.0,"An easy, 30-minute hike up this mountain -- a hill really -- brings you to a simple park with a colorful pavilion from where you can enjoy a magnificant view of the Han River and the southern side of Seoul. It's worth taking a trek up the hill during both a clear day and night, providing two divergent but gorgeous views of the city. Recommend hiking up the lighted path on the east side (via Eungbong subway station) at night and going up the west side via one of several trail heads near the Eungbong Community Center during the day. (Bus No. 241, 421, 08)."
1,4.0,Visited during the day and it was not too challenging a climb from the subway station. Nice views of the river and bridges though during the day the not very scenic industrial parts are evident too. There is a nice pavilion at the top and quite a few people out for morning exercise!
2,4.0,This is a great place for a walk or bike in central Seoul. It's similar to Namsan but less touristy and with better views. Especially good in spring when the flowers are blooming!
