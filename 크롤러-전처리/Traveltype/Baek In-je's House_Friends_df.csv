0,4.0,"This is a small museum mansion. Built in 1913 by a pro-Japanese business tycoon, later bought by several people and in the end bought by Baek In Jae-an activist. The mansion has tatami room. Worth a visit."
1,5.0,"One of the best Hanok experiences in Seoul for me. You can visit the inside of the yard and the house, the old house architecture with wooden doors and awnings make the pictures taken very beautiful. You can visit for free, the museum area is quite hidden so the number of visitors is not much, so you can freely travel inside comfortably."
2,4.0,"Baek In-Je House Museum is a wonderful place for visitors who are on their track to find Bukchon 8 Spots because it is located in the same area (Bukchon Hanok Village). Although the house was not really huge, the house is full of surprised because you'll get to see how people used to live in a traditional Korean house FOR FREE!! If you are really interested in this place, remember to bring a map or else you might get lost between those houses! The only bad thing of this place is that it is not disable friendly!"
