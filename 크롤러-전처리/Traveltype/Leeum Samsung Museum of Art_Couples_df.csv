0,1.0,"If you are not in great shape or got the money for a taxi ride up the hill, don't even think of visiting.A perfect zero score for the management who didn't think about accessability - even the audio guides cannot be adjusted properly."
1,2.0,"Maybe we expected just too much because we were so disappointed. Expensive and there's nothing special to see even we walked through all museums. Most interesting is building itself, outside and inside."
2,2.0,"I was really excited after seeing many positive reviews, even despite having to pay 10$ for a ticket - eg. Korean National Museum is free. But most of the work was old ceramics, not really what I wanted to see. There are a few great pieces and I love the architecture but I wasn’t even able to take a picture of anything. I experienced this for the first time. Usually you can’t take pictures with a flash, and I totally understand that. But here, you can’t take ANY picture. Plus, an alarm rings every time you get too close to the painting. As if guards each step you go weren’t enough. Unless they have a painting you really want to see and pay for that, I advise you not to go. I really don’t understand why this museum has so many good reviews."
3,5.0,"this museum is worth 3-4 hours, with a break in the cafe. the collection of celadon pottery is breathtaking. in addition there is a wonderful contemporary collection."
4,5.0,"It was designed by 3 architects, one of them being Jean Nouvel. We visited 2 of the buildings. The exhibitions were beautiful. But no photos were permitted.The neighbourhood in which the museum is located is also very interesting to visit by food with a lot of creatively designed shops and residentially houses."
5,4.0,Great museum for modern art.  Also exhibit of traditional Korean pottery.  Interesting architecture combining three different buildings.  Good views from grounds.
6,5.0,"Very nice buildings, excellent collection, quiet and in a nice, lively and arty neighborhood with fancy shops"
7,5.0,This museum is stunning. Exquisite works are beautifully displayed in a wonderful setting.  Do not miss out! It is easily accessible by the Seoul subway.
8,5.0,We loved this museum. It has terrific exhibits. For $1 you can get an audio tour that is excellent. The gift shop has gorgeous items. The neighborhood has many good restaurants too.
9,4.0,"It was raining so we decided to take a museum tour, this is one of the stop, wonderful outstanding collections, can easily spend few hour here, because our time was limited, maybe the next time come here by ourselves to really explore."
10,5.0,"We visit this museum and were surprises. For the beginning , the architectuur of the building is wunderfull.There are 2 musea inside and sometime even a third exposition.We liked the modern museum as most.The fee is 10.000 won. Are you older dan 65 than 5000 won.We recommend"
11,5.0,"Well designed building housing some national treasures(porcelain) as well as some fabulous modern art. The central staircase reminds one of the Guggenheim in New York, the art is very well dispersed allowing one plenty of time to move for new views without being hindered by other museum goers."
12,4.0,"Nicely organized, not big, good for a 2hr visit. Not very crowded. Within walking distance to the Grand Hyatt Hotel."
13,5.0,"Beside having a very impressive collection of ceramics, the museum also has a built in sensors for your listening guide.  I was grateful that all I had to do is stand by the display to have the audio device automatically start talking about it.  No need to plug in numbers or go in a specific manner.  A marvelous museum in all areas."
14,3.0,"On the last Wednesday of the month they have half price admission. Which is the price that this gallery should be normally. We were impressed by the ceramics exhibit and some of the great modern art on display. Of particular interest was the piece by Paik Nam June an incredibly underrated Korean artist. One of the few Korean artists that was a true genius and not derivative.On the other hand we expected more from a gallery that is sponsored by Samsung a multi billion dollar company. Parts of the long spiral staircase very clearly needed cleaning or new paint. Instead of all the uniformed staff who were standing and not doing much, they should hire more cleaners. Another small complaint about the ceramics and metal collection was that original items and reproductions were not clearly distinguished. All in all it's worth a visit and we were very impressed that the front security guard opened our taxi door for us and greeted us warmly."
15,5.0,"This museum is made up of 3 interesting buildings each designed by a different architect. There are two galleries, one is a modern art exhibition and the other is Korean. Both are very good. The architecture is fantastic. The outside has a few interesting pieces.The surrounding neighborhood is very upscale with interesting and modern villas all around. Definitely worth a visit."
16,5.0,"Visited on one of our last days here...not my favourite district but worth visiting for the gallery.As you'd expect from Samsung, this gallery is super modern, great architecture and great media guides. Before you pay to get into the museum, there are outdoor works you can visit. We saw a couple of Anish Kapoor pieces before escaping the sun.The museum is split into a few different sections - traditional works focusing on ancient Buddhist pieces and ceylon pottery before moving into the modern/contemporary pieces. Some well known international artists (Eliasson installation is pretty cool!) but particularly enjoyed the Korean artists on show.The media guides start automatically when you stand in front of certain pieces and go into just enough detail without being boring. Skipped a few towards the end as realised it is very easy to spend hours here.  Only negative is that moving around a bit can affect the guide and for some pieces it didn't play automatically (very easy to get used to not having to push an buttons!) Definitely pay the extra for the guide! We weren't going to take them but after the staff recommended them, we were glad we did. They are pretty cool and explain everything in a nice, informative way :)"
17,3.0,A bit of a walk form metro stop. We were a bit disappointed by the works on display consisting of traditional art works and modern art. Spent under an hour here
18,4.0,This is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours on a dry day so you can take advantage of the outdoor art park that includes some large sculptures. Indoors you will find there are two separate collections: one traditional and one contemporary. The traditional art is a great collection of celadon displayed to best advantage with direct lighting and muted backgrounds and some modern canvases to offset. The Modern collection is from 1910 onward and while not a huge fan of this kind of art; there are some very significant works here. There was enough whimsy throughout the collection to make it endearing and enjoyable. Staff was professional and no different from any other museum staff in the hundreds of museums I have visited over the years.A word of caution: there is a wonderful interactive room; absolutely a must-see:just mind your head on the way out as the sign says.
19,1.0,"The service was horrible - no smile, all the staff on their phones and when I went to the coffee after visiting the museum for a  piece of cake (which I paid) , I asked for a glass of water and the waiter told me : ""here you can get water only if you pay"" ! I was a bit shocked so I asked at the front desk if I can have just a glass of tab water and they told me ""No""It was canicule outside and I felt very bad For a museum which pretends to show what is Korean culture it is quite on the edge. It shows a culture without any respect neither politeness. I did not see that anywhere else either in other museums of Seoul, or anywhere else in the world to make people pay for tabwater. For a pretended national institution it is rather a national shame"
20,4.0,"The collection of Korean ceramics, paintings, and bronzes is beautiful. They are displayed in the circular floor-plan building and are very well presented and described. The collection is not large and even if you read everything, it is not more than about an hour's visit (for a pricey KRW 10,000). The contemporary art part of the museum is smaller.This is not the easiest museum to access in Seoul and is a bit removed from other attractions. It is in the Itaewon area, which is a somewhat gritty street with souveneir shops, galleries, bars, and restaurants."
21,1.0,"At one glance from the outside, the architecture and design was stunning and could appeal to the visitors. However, the turn off was the inside, where the lack service from the staff on site couldn't make up for the efforts they put into the arts on display. Staff was unfriendly and lazy, at times playing with their phones. Even though a museum is not a place to impress visitors in services, but no smiles on the faces of staff when they see us makes visitors uncomfortable and unable to enjoy the experience. Not worthy of even a penny."
22,5.0,"The historical part has a spectacular scenography, and we contemporary part displays a very interesting masterpiece of great artist. You should count 3 hour for the visit."
23,2.0,"Looking from the outside I really can't wait to get into this museum as I expected to see something special there. Not interesting. Absolutely poor museum. Really disappointing. Now, after the visit, I wish I staid away and save time and money because it was lost."
24,5.0,"The Leeum (Samsung Museum) itself is a work of art, with architecture by Rem Koolhaus, Mario Botta and Jean Nouvel. It is much larger than I realized, so I saw the complete modern and contemporary collection, but only scratched the surface of the tradional museum. You should allow 3  hours to see everything. The modern and contemporary museum is a beautifully curated. Among many others, it houses pieces by Korean artists Lee Joong-seop, Park Soo-keum and Nam Jun Paiik, and Western artists Damien Hirst, Cindy Sherman, Louise Bourgeois, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko. Make sure you rent the Digital Guide, a hand-held device that provides high-resolution images and information for all the works of art. As you approach a work of art, the device automatically recognizes and briefly explains each of the works on display. If you want more information, you can simply click on the image to learn more about the artist and the work."
25,1.0,"Unfriendly and too few staff that results in a tense and chaotic atmosphere. Inefficient layout, stuffy air, bad curating and ridiculously expensive. Even if I try really hard I can barely find any good attributes about this place - but then again, all opinions are subjective. I guess you could say that the surrounding area is quite pleasant; I felt much more positive and engaged while walking around than I've ever felt inside this 'museum'. Too commercial, flooded with local doing everything to get the best angle for their selfies, instead of looking at the works. This place managed to make even Olafur Eliasson's works bad."
26,4.0,"The museum is split into three: contemporary, Korean and visiting exhibitions (additional cost). The Korean covers pottery, buddhist artifacts and paintings, all of which are very well presented and sourced. The contemporary is a mix of western and Korean artists, mainly Abstract. Close to some Rothkos is a blank black wall which was attracting interest until they realised it was just an empty wall; summed up Abstract art quite succinctly. The Bacon is quite wonderful though. The buildings are interesting in themselves too."
27,5.0,"Metro line 6 - Stn Hangangjin, exit 1. Walk straight out from the exit and soon you will see signs for the museum. It is about 300m total. Currently they have a special exhibition by Olafur Eliasson called ""The Parliament of Possibilities"". I am not normally a modern art lover, but the wife dragged me in and I love it. His mix of engineering and design with his pieces, I just found fascinating. Pitty there are only 2 floors of his art. The rest of the museum is so so, a few good pieces and a lot of pieces I have the equivalent (or better) from my 5 year old. w14,000 for all exhibitions, includes the audio guide. Lockers there as you can't take anything in that is bigger than a small handbag. Free WiFi. Some exhibitions you can't take photos. Museum Cafe."
28,5.0,"I was very surprised by this museum. We went there not expecting much, but was blown away by by the high standard, both content wise as well as location/architecture.Also being a huge fan of Anish Kapoor is was very pleased by the courtyard. Great shop as well!Highly recommended!"
29,5.0,We took a taxi to the museum. The buildings are impressive and very modern inside and out. The main collections include both traditional and modern art. Mostly korean but we also saw some of our favourites like giacometti and rothko. The lighting on the works really adds another flare which I really liked. There isn't a lot of descriptions by the works so it might be worth getting an audio guide to appreciate them more in depth. We felt that the museum wasn't overloaded with art and was just right to see on a morning visit. There are extra collections which we didn't see though if you wanted more. There didn't seem to be many cafes or restaurants around the museum. Probably have to walk a bit to itaewon or something.
30,5.0,"For long, our favorite museum has been the MOMA. We have found a new one : the Leeum Samsung Museum of Art. 3 buildings (in themselves pieces of art), one for the traditional Korea, one for the more modern one and one for special exhibitions (Olafur Eliasson at the time we visited the museum, just brillant). The museum is not referenced by all guide books, but that's a pity because it really worth the visit. We spent c. 4hours and did not see the time spent.We seldom recommend museum on trip advisor, but this one clearly deserves it."
31,5.0,"Two museums in one:The first museum is dedicated to Korean art and heritage; amazing collection of ancient ceramics (celadon, etc.).The second musum is must for lovers of contemporary art.Apart from a couple of pieces of Damien Hirst (not my genre but surely visitor-magnets) many interesting works of other top international artists of the caliber of Francis Bacon, etc., as well as of Korean artist I was not familiar with.Will go again"
32,4.0,Really enjoyed this museum.  We decided to buy a ticket to see the permanent exhibition and the current show.  The person at the desk showed us what the current show looked like to help us to decide.There are also recommended routes depending on the time you have available - which we only saw at the end of our visit!  Think it was on the printed info they gave us.The audio guide - a Samsung product- is great.  It automatically starts telling you about the work you are standing in front of.  There is an option to press a button to learn more.  For a lot of the works you can see a photo and turn the photo 360 degrees.
33,4.0,"I visited the Leeum in the November 2016. Even from the outside, the Leeum makes a very technological and modern impression. The cards for all three galleries are about 8,000 KW.Gallery number one is split into three floors and shows a wide range of Korean pottery, history and many other ancient to modern samples of Korean culture or art. During the transition in Gallery 1 from one floor to another, one can gaze at the wonderful stairs which, build an artwork as well.The next exhibition quite has a modern tone and appealed from my opinion, best to me. It really was quite breathtaking what could be constructed with just a few simple materials. I loved the room with the rainy day atmosphere, absolutely stunning.And last but not least: the 3rd exhibition. I personally do not like abstract and modern art, in forms of paintings, so this part of the gallery did not quite appeal to me. But for people who do, I believe it to be very interesting since it has a huge range of artworks like that. This gallery is spread over three floors. Traveller Tip: You can borrow an audio guide for free!You can also take with a camera, but in few cases, you may not be allowed to take a picture of the artwork for whatever reason. The exhibitions really take time, so make sure you consider it during your planning! This activity takes up to three hours inside of the gallery, if you listen to everything the audioguide tells you about each object. Normally, it may take about two hours or so. I believe there are some modern artworks outside, but I did not visit any of those."
34,5.0,Had 90 minutes to visit this museum. Happy that they are showing Olafur Eliasson. Their abstractions collection is pretty complete with all the famous western names. Remember to pick up a free audio help as it a better experience going around with it. The only problem is they do not allow photography inside the museum.
35,3.0,We came here because of the many positive reviews. We were quite disappointed  in the small collection ofcontemproray art .   We felt it was not worth a visit   We should have instead headed to art galeries
36,4.0,"This museum is nested in the multicultural Itaewon neighbourhood of Seoul. It's located in the older part and you have to follow a few winding roads to find it. It is a gem in the rough surroundings. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and we were pleasantly surprised by the exhibitions and the effects built into the museum. If you have an hour or two to kill, this is worth the visit."
37,4.0,"Best way to get to Leeum is by taking exit 1 from Hangangjin metro station and continuing down the street until you see a sign that directs you to the museum. Entrance for adults is 10k KRW and the museum is well staffed by suit wearing guards, made me wish I hadn't worn t-shirt and shorts.The historical exhibition is small enough that you can maintain focus and the pieces are well displayed all though a little bit dimly lit.The contemporary exhibition (museum 2) contains some huge paintings and sculptures (just my kind thing!) by some really famous artists."
38,5.0,"Located in the lavish neighborhood of Itaewon, this museum is hidden in the small roads, approx. 5-10 mins from the main street (depending on how long you want to get lost in the many roads which offer cute cafes and beyond) Everything here is showcased with perfection. The arts you find here is like nothing else. You need to visit it to believe that I'm no liar."
39,5.0,"Leeum Samsung Museum of Art is a collection of three beautifully designed buildings that house traditional Korean arts, a contemporary museum with Korean and international paintings/exhibits, and an education center.  The buildings themselves are as beautiful as the art - well worth a visit!"
40,5.0,One of the most enjoyable museum visit we experienced.  The Samsung tablet audio guide did its job brilliantly.  Great mix in modern and new artists.  Beautiful ceramic pieces.  Wonderful architecture.  Very nice coffee shop to take a rest before continuing to explore.  So please that we made the effort to go on our last day in Seoul.
41,4.0,"Great Museum. Beautifully designed building.Architecture is very nice like Roppongi, however collection a bit small if you have seen MOMA."
42,4.0,The Leeum Samsung Museum has both a traditional Korean art component and a modern art area.  We only toured the modern art area which was easy to see in a few hours.  We took advantage of the warmth indoors to escape the cold of Seoul's winter.  There are some very cool art pieces inside and of course the exterior courtyard offered some stunning installations.
43,1.0,"This is by far the worst art museum I've been to having been to many free and an amazing museums around the world. The charge is 10,000 won ($10) for the pleasure of seeing the founder of Samsung's private collection. When you can see some amazing Joseon artefacts at the National Museum for free and you can see Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and Antonio Giacometti's work for free in any national museum in Europe and other parts of Asia. Rude and unwelcoming staff. Too many rules including, you can't walk in your own free way around the museum, you have to use their patronising audio guide (using a Samsung device) a gimmick that tracks and gives you patronising and pretentious information at the same time for every piece in both museums.  Your told to move away from work even if you are a foot away from the barrier they've set! More staff to supervise visiors than necessary! At one point an over dressed member of staff followed me around the museumCan't take photos of their precious art collection! Never experienced anything like this. I have been to enough museum to know how to behave in them. To be constantly told what to in this museum was intolerable. Art is what you can get away with - Andy Warhol"
44,5.0,"A great architectural venue. The collection is a bit of a show-off when it comes to Western artists, but the venue is magnificent and the collections well put together. Great Asian works too and special collection on Korean architecture was particularly interesting."
45,5.0,"A two part museum, with a permanent collection and temporary exhibits. Ultra modern technology guides making navigating the museum a great deal of fun and very informative. Go for both parts if you have the time. Not to be missed."
46,5.0,"Visited the Leeum Samsung Museum recently and very much enjoyed our time spent at this world-class private collection in Seoul.  Entry fee is ₩10,000 to view the two permanent collections and ₩5000 for special exhibitions. Opening hours are 10.30am to 6pm daily but closed on Mondays. The Leeum permanent collection is divided into two Museums. First, you can view Museum 1 - Beyond Time, which features Korean artefacts of national treasure level of quality. Some of pieces on display are nothing short of exquisite, particularly the celadon collection. Outstanding examples of white porcelain, Buncheong, painted images and metal works are on display. This is a very special collection, the calibre of which you will not often see.  Interestingly, Museum 1 is spaced out over several floors, with a centre, downward spiralling staircase that resembles what you find at the Guggenheim Museum in NYC but on a much smaller scale. Museum 2 - Beyond Space features modern and contemporary works by Korean and international artists spaced out over three floors in a more conventional art space. The works change out from time to time. Of the works presently on display we enjoyed seeing Zeng Fanzhi's 'This land is Rich in Beauty' (1964) painting as well as Suh Se-Ok's 'Dancers I' (1988). Suh Se-Ok presently has a large scale exhibition at MMCA Seoul Museum if you want to see more similar works by this important Korean artist. Overall, we greatly appreciated our time at the Leeum Samsung Museum. This is is well curated and wonderful private collection, providing visitors an exceptional art experience. Leeum is certainly a Must-See for art lovers visiting Seoul. Hint: Almost all items of the Lleum collection on display can be viewed first on the museum website. This is well worth viewing in advance of your visit to help prepare yourself for what you will see during your visit to the Samsung Museum."
47,5.0,"The gardens with the spectacular outdoor sculptures were wonderful.  The exterior and interior designs were first rate, by amazing architects, Koolhaus, Botta and Nouvel. Exhibits included historical artifacts and contemporary international art. Most amazing are the mobile Samsung devices used for guidance, which audio described each piece fully and visually the device's display on the screen allowed expansion of the item for closer viewing. I'm returning for another tour when I go back to Seoul. Very nice cafe inside as well."
48,2.0,"While this is a stunning museum from an design standpoint, it was my least favourite museum that I visited while in Seoul. The exhibitions were rather boring in Museum 1 (you really have to like ceramics to enjoy it), but Museum 2 has some interesting modern art. I would probably not recommend visiting this museum to anyone being that there are several museums that are free and have far better exhibitions around Seoul."
49,4.0,"Leeum is a very nice museum, and probably the most modern of the major museums in Korea : the building itself is a wonder, ans on the Inside, the rooms are arranged in an interesting manner. The lightning is also amazing, especially for the Celadon collection. iPad-like devices allow for better viewing of some artifacts. The contemporary art section is also definitely Worth it, with works from major artists displayed (Francis Bacon, Alberto Giacometti...). These are really masterpieces in Western modern and contemporary art, something that is not always easy to find in Korea. There are two negatives to this museum though : it's pricey, being a private museum, and it's not so big (I'd say you need two hours to visit it, three hours max), so it might not be bang for your buck if you're defining ""bang"" as ""time""."
50,5.0,"I came with no expectations, and left thinking it was one of the best art museums I've been to (I've been to many).  Firstly, the building itself is impressive, and conveniently located next to some cool restaurants and coffee shops. Secondly, the museum has both an antique Korean art collection and a modern art collection, so you get a rounded view of Korean art within the space of a couple of hours. Thirdly, their audio guides are the best - in that they automatically start playing the relevant section as soon as you approach an object - there's no need to fumble around for numbers (why aren't all audio guides designed to do this?)."
51,3.0,"From reading the commentary in the Lonely Planet guide to Seoul our expectations of this museum were high. We started with Museum 2, the contemporary art collection and to make a long story short : only a few pieces were worth the trip. Museum 1 was merely OK."
52,3.0,"In the Lonely Planet guide of Seoul this museum was highly recommended and thus we were expecting an interesting collection. Unfortunately, very few pieces were worth the trip to this museum."
53,4.0,Traditional Art en modern Art comes together in this inspirational building. Don't miss it and see for yourself!
54,4.0,"fantastic exhibits and art work. Its abit tricky to find but worth a visit. It shows how monder technology and art can work together. the building architecture is fab, with each one being different from another and in great contrast."
55,5.0,Loved all the exhibits. I enjoyed the western and eastern mixes. I wish the cafe had a bit more food and drink - but the gift shop was nice!  Luckily there's some good restaurants around.
56,5.0,There are three building all in one location and each one is different. Designed by 3 different architects. The ceramic collection from the Chosun dynasty is beautiful. There are some Aneesh Chopra pieces including the stainless steel spheres at the entrance
57,5.0,"They host always interesting exhibition. Nice interior, but, ticketing woman was unkind."
58,5.0,We were a bit put-off by the odd location but I could not recommend this incredible gallery more highly.This is the only gallery we allowed time for on our trip and I am so glad. The contemporary collection on the ground floor of Museum Two is something I will remember for a very long time.If you purchase tickets to the two main galleries (7000 won) and the visiting exhibition (8000 won) you get a special deal for (10000 won) and one of the best audio guides I've ever used.The area around the gallery turned out to be fantastic with great cafes and drool-worthy local shops
59,5.0,"This Museum/Art Gallery has an amazing collection of Korean artwork and an eclectic mix of modern piece set in an architectural amazing building. The portable guide show cases Samsung technology by providing multiple language explanations of the artwork automatically as you approach the art work (Near field communications).  We wished we had more time to appreciate this gallery further, allow at least 4hrs to enjoy."
60,2.0,"Announced as the best museum in Seoul, the expectations were high. But what a disappointment. Entry fee way too high for what you get. Artist works are ok, but not the top for this entry fee. Will never return, there are many better museums in town!"
61,3.0,"Some of the art works, especially the modern art portion, are really too casual.  There isn't much that draws our interest..."
62,1.0,"After you buy your ticket, you go to the lockers where you have to give all large bags. There is a sign mentioning you 'd better don't leave any valuable items in the storage room. As our camera is a valuable item, we wanted to take it with us but this was not allowed. We assured we wouldn't take a photo but even then we couldn't take this with us. Strange... as everybody can take his Phone with him inside the museum and, as everybody knows, people do take pictures with their Phone (we saw people doing this). There were no maps or other of the museum. We visited musem 1 and 2 and both were very disappointing! After we took our bag and camera again out of the storage room, we saw there was a third part at the same entrance of the childrens museum part. Too bad, as we couldn't visit this part with bag and camera. The museum is in Seoul on every map and in every guide with the picture of a large spider. Asking where we could see this art creature, people said the spider was replaced by something else. So, another disappointment. I should say: if you doubt on this museum don't go! There are plenty other things to so and to see in Seoul that are much more interesting!"
63,5.0,"Visited with a Korean friend who wanted to show us Korean ceramic s, from 600 AD to 19th Century.  Very good display.  Very modern museum."
64,3.0,"There are no Samsung devices in this museum, just the art - traditional and contemporary. I was impressed by contemporary collection - just 2,5 floors with some works from Hirst, Ai Weiwei, Rothko, and some Asian artists."
65,5.0,Awesome collection. Well curated mix of old and new. Fabulous architecture and site. Amazing digital support!  My only regret is that we ran out of time to see it all.  It is in itaewon - and was a ways from our hotel. But just two subways and eight stations. Wish I had spent the day there. My top favorite museum for Seoul.
66,5.0,"This has a LOT of great pieces, but of course, not too many of the greats like you find in the Louvre.  It really comes into it's own if you opt for the audio tour.  You're given a Note 2, and exhibits will start explaining themselves to you as you walk around the Museum.  These are not one or two line blurbs though.  The art explanations are detailed, interesting, and in my view better than any museum in the world.  You really do learn to APPRECIATE the art because everything is explained to you, and every single detail becomes crystal clear.  All in all I'd have to say this is the most enjoyable art museum I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.  (I'm not even an art buff)"
67,5.0,"It contains an impressive collection of Koreana treasures.  The building is also amazing.  Entry fees might be a little expensive, nevertheless, if you appreciate art and want to better understand Korea, you must visit this private museum.  It's worth every penny!"
68,5.0,"Can see the chairman Lee family’s collection. Quite extensive from gorgeous Korean antiques to modern pop-arts. Very diversified portfolio in each level, and I certainly enjoyed the architecture. Modern, spacious but minimalistic with perfect lighting controls. The guide book was thoroughly prepared in different language and the souvenir shops offers impressive stuff, from scarf & rings to art works; could be expensive but you couldn’t buy anywhere else. One flaw is that it’s quite expensive to get in and there are not many sitting places, nor restaurants like Tate Modern. Understandable as business model and motivation are different. All of my European friends were quite impressed from A to Z. Can definitely visit again."
69,5.0,"Loved the architecture, the outdoor area, the combination of traditional and modern art. dislikes: nothing!"
70,5.0,"Simply loveeee Leeum! My background is art and design so coming to Leeum was the highlight of my Seoul trip. I was pretty bored with the shops in Myeongdong and a bit disappointed that autumn has not really kicked-in yet. Was hoping to get some pretty autumn photos but the leaves were still green. Fortunately, Leeum was able to make me smile from ear to ear. The museum building itself was a masterpiece and it boasts excellent collections from traditional to modern art. This museum is a must-go place if you ever travel to Seoul. Tips: the best way to get there is by taxi (approx. USD 5 from Myeongdong area)."
71,5.0,"The museum was inspiring! Very beautiful and showed a modern side of Seoul. I think it’s a must to go, after visiting all the ancient building and palaces. It gave me a better view of Seoul, strong tradition, still so young and energetic!"
72,5.0,"If you only have time for one gallery in Seoul, this is the best choice.  It is architecturally stunning, and has both traditional and modern collections.  A high point for us was a whole floor of beautifully displayed ceramics (Celadon) from the 12th century, each item in its own individual glass case with precision lighting.  Utterly different was some modern work by Rothko, de Kooning, Gorky and Bacon.  The museum is on the south side of Namsam, not that easy to reach by subway - probably best by taxi.  Then its a short walk downhill to Itaewon with its many restaurants, bars and cafes."
73,5.0,Three galleries with a very interesting designed building. Use the little samsung gallery guide for the best experience. Don't miss the modern stuff including a Jeff Koons sculpture. Wander up to the Grand Hyatt after for a drink.
74,4.0,The museum displays much of Leum Samsungs personal collection of Korean historical artefacts as well as modern art from around the world. Strange mix but still a good museum to visit.
75,3.0,"Maybe I've been spoiled by some of the great (non-Art) museums in Seoul, but this museum was just average. I get especially annoyed with pottery and this museum has a whole building dedicated to that. They banned all photography, which I always find annoying at museums. I want to remember things! (I understand that the flash ruins things, but why ban un-flashed photography too?) All in all, though there were a few pieces I really liked, it was overall very OK (if that makes sense)."
76,5.0,"Leeum Samsung Museum of Art holds no less than 36 National Treasures. This alone makes the museum significant. The extensive collection of art, celadon, manuscripts, and ancient artifacts make the museum a must-see.The museum displays ancient and modern art, and this dynamic makes the experience more engaging than traditional museums. The museum is state of the art, the displays are excellent, and the multi-language signage is a great help. Browsing the wonderful collection can easily take up 3 hours, but the time is well worth it."

78,2.0,"This museum has several strengths, among them a superb collection of Korean ceramics and Buddhist images. They are beautiful, and number among them several ""national treasures.""The collection of modern works, paintings and sculpture, is less impressive. The Korean works seem stale and unimaginative and the examples from Western art, with a few exceptions, are lackluster. The museum itself is an unpleasant place. The staff stand around with heads down as if in respectful remembrance of their deceased artists, but on closer inspection it turns out they are playing with electronic devices. You have to follow the regimen of the museum, which does not encourage you to wander around freely. In sum, the atmosphere is one of bored stuffiness, just the sort of thing that a museum should take pains to avoid."

It is in a nice part of town, and if you get hungry, there are some good places just a couple of blocks away.  The reception directed us out the front door to the left - take the second alley and down the hill you will see some places to eat.  We ate the dumplings at O Chicken, and they were enormous and delicious!"
