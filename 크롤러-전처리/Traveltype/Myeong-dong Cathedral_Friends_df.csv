0,4.0,The view was really pretty at night while we were there as the the church was lighted up  and the surroundings were illuminated with a field of LED roses. The church is located beside the myeongdong shopping street so it is convenient to drop by and have a quick tour before or after shopping.
1,4.0,"Finally got here on my 5th visit to Seoul, beautiful architecture within the cathedral and there was a couple taking wedding photos in winter!"
2,5.0,"I'm elated that the Cathedral was full when the mass started. People cannot go in the church once the mass has started. There were mostly old people and their responses during the mass were simultaneous and synchronized. Though the mass was in Korean, my head felt lighter after the one hour solemn celebration.In terms of the Cathedral structure, one should see the gothic facade of the church if you're touring, shopping or trying street food around Myeongdong for the first time. It's located at the back end of the long street full of people from Myeongdong Station near the highway."
3,5.0,We were met by a Korean nun/doctor in our hotel and toured us the beautiful Myeondong Cathedral. It was a Friday and found the church service very solemn.  Went back  again Saturday to attend the 6:00 p.m. mass.  A must to visit to Christian Catholics.
4,5.0,This cathedral was just opposite our Hotel situate on top of a hill. We visited on New Years eve and the cathedral was full as service was on. The cathedral has lovely architecture and was lit up beautifully. A must-see if you are in Seoul.
5,5.0,"When we visited Myeong-dong, we noticed there is a church within where we stayed.  We looked for it using the map.  When we reached there, one could notice the beautiful church in the heart of Myeong-dong.  We went inside and prayed.  The church is quite empty.  But it was a nice place to say your prayers...."
6,5.0,A very nice cathedral at the heart of Myeong-dong. It has stores under the cathedral that offers catholic and non-catholic items.

11,5.0,"Located in the heart of Seoul, this gothic cathedral is the good place for pilgirimage. Although this first catholic church is just a step away from busy Myeongdong street, you can feel peace and quietness there. The English mass celebrated every Sunday at 9 a.m. You can also find many religious souvenirs in a shop at the cathedral area. This shop open at 9.30 a.m.The best photospot (for me) is near the stairs to cathedral. You can make a nice picture with a whole great Myeongdong Cathedral behind youPS: Don’t forget to give your warm greetings to Virgin Mary after the mass"
12,5.0,"The church is very near the hotel where we stayed.(Royal Hotel Seoul).It is just a few meters from the hotel.A must for all catholics  while in seoul.After mass ,you can find a lot of coffee shop and restaurant within the area."

14,4.0,"the Myeong-dong Cathedral is a magnificent building in the middle of the Myeong-dong district. The property is large and welcoming to all visitors who want to explore the property. The cathedral is built in a classical style with beautiful stained glass windows and if you are a fan of historical buildings and cathedrals, this a great place to stop."
15,5.0,"Standing right in the middle of Myeongdong street, Myeongdong catholic church welcomes everybody from everywhere.  You may get inside the chapel and feel the holy spirit of this place. A small but well equipped store is selling holy stuffs including bibles and rosaries."

17,3.0,Picturesque and not to be missed when walking through Myeongdong market area.  Don't forget to say your prayers inside the cathedral :)
18,2.0,"I came here to full time before heading back home and was disappointed. Although it's called a cathedral in Europe this would be classed as a big church. I didn't find it overly decorative or interesting, the shopping streets nearby offered more. Apparently it's one of the oldest buildings in Seoul as lots were destroyed during the war but I was expecting more to be honest. There are plenty of better things to do in Seoul."
19,4.0,"If you love Gothic Cathedrals, this is a great spot, contrasting a lot of traditional and contemporary Korean architecture. Settled a 5 min walk away from one of the busiest shopping neighborhoods, it offers a nice pause from the buzz."
20,4.0,"It was a surprise to see this church in Seoul.  I was expecting people to be of different religions.  But in fact, about 25% are Christian.  The church is nice but not a real attraction for us coming from Europe where there is endless numbers of churches of this kind.  But I see that many new churches are now in building process in Seoul.  And it will be interesting to have a look at them later on."
21,3.0,If you have been to Europe or North America there are probably better Cathedrals to see. This is a very modest building.
22,5.0,"I've been there twice already because Pope Francis visited this church during his visit in Seoul. This is located in the heart of downtown Seoul Myeondong and is the first parish church in Korea and the most important symbol of the Korean Catholic Church. Its called "" Myeong-rye-bang during Joseon Dynasty and was formed 1784.  If you want to visit the church, look for Sejong Hotel and at the side of the hotel there is a road going to the church just follow it and at the end of it turn left and you will see the church. Sunday English mass at 7am and 9 am ( in the cathedral). Confession will be done before 9 am sunday mass."
23,5.0,"As Catholics, it was a must to visit, pay your respects and pray. It has beautiful exteriors as well as interiors. It's just sad the mass had just wrapped up. Amusing that it was situated in the middle of a busy and noisy shopping area though."
24,5.0,"I visited with a friend from overseas. It is easily accessible, located in one of the touristy area called Myeongdong."
25,2.0,"Located just a short walking distance from Exit 9 of Myeongdong Station, a place rich in history. The first parish church and place for the Catholic communityThe Church's beautiful architecture and lovely stained glasses are well maintain in in  pristine condition. I belief that such pure Gothic architecture building style is a rare find in Seoul.If in need of some inner-peace & self-reflection time, a trip hear will fullfil the objective."
26,4.0,"I attend 9 AM English Sunday Mass. The mass is very sacred. However, please expect some tourist tours to appears until 3 minutes before the mass begin."
27,5.0,"When you're going to visit this cathedral, don't miss to visit the cathedral cafe ""Jeonkwangsoo"" under the cathedral. You can enjoy very fresh and nice coffee with the cathedral souvenirs in the cozy and comfortable area. By the way, this cathedral dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the principal patron saint of Korea and the Korean people, the cathedral is a community landmark and a notable symbol of Catholicism in Korea. The cathedral church is one of the earliest and most notable examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Korea."
28,4.0,Catholic church located at myeongdong. Very beatiuful cathedral and many tourist in there to pray n take photo.
29,3.0,"We witnessed a wedding here and it was beautiful. Do visit if you're in the area,  but i would  not go out of my way to see it."
30,5.0,"The weekend I was there, there was an indoor and outdoor weekend market. It was thronging with buyers and sellers and there was a steady stream of visitors. On another when I visited, the Cathedral was a calm, peaceful to just be."
31,5.0,"Admittedly, the cathedral itself isn't particularly spectacular especially if you've seen gothic cathedrals all over Europe.  However, Myeongdong Cathedral is beautiful because it stands along in a sea of modern buildings and lights.  It's also situation on top of a hill, and you have to climb these rock stairs to get there and from the bottom of the hill it just adds to the majestic-ness of the cathedral.  I visited at night back in December and they had these gorgeous flower lights in the entire front lawn area.  But as you're enjoying the using of this cathedral, do yourself a favor and turn around and see the view behind you.  It's an amazing juxtaposition of old and new :)"
32,3.0,This centenary cathedral is a must-see attraction in Seoul. You can watch ceremony in Korean and English.
33,5.0,"Very rare you find a Cathedral in a central location. I mean just outside the cathedral is the Shopping street of Myeong-dong!!! Besides the structure of the cathedral, its intrinsic architecture, the open space and campus around, the well planned hall and dining area. Every single thing here is well thought out, well planned and well executed. This cathedral also has an underground restaurant in its campus which serves good Korean food, make sure you practice using chopsticks for having your meals."
34,4.0,"The Meong-dong Cathedral is a very unique construction, it attracts you by its arquitectural point of view and the surroundings area that matches and gives you a very relaxing feel"
35,5.0,Attended a mass and though I did not understand the language but I felt the solemnity and quietness.  Korean Catholics showed their deep devotion.  On time and not talking while inside the church.
36,5.0,Very interesting to realize that in Korea exists a special University for women. Different than other places///
37,3.0,"The story behind it is really interesting but there isn't much to see. you can stop by if you're heading into myeongdong, but I wouldn't visit the area especially for this."
38,4.0,"The Catholic Church is very easy to find as this is in Myeongdong Station.  It is located in a hilly portion, so you would find it easily.  Regular mass is held here both in English and Korean.  After attending the mass you can go around shopping or dine at the restaurants around the church area. Be sure that you are in Church dress if you are attending the Mass."
39,5.0,Great and gigantic cathedral. Reminds me of Notre Dame in France. Quiet place to thank God for the good things in life and a respite from the busy city life.
40,5.0,We went to mass on Sunday.  You will need to arrive early if you want a seat. There are a lot of visitors mostly people from South Korea that come to Seoul to shop or visit.   I really enjoyed people watching here. The locals bring their dogs with them and stand right at the back entrance and listen to mass.  There are area for worship for outside and j there is an area in the back where the children sit under the trees and have some activities. Also just down the hill there is the Myeong-dog street vendors and shops restaurants.  We ended up shopping at the underground shops/emergency shelter for when North Korea starts any conflicts.
41,5.0,The Myeongdong Cathedral is tourist friendly cause it is within walking distance of so many hotels to think that Korea is not considered a catholic country.  Just hope that they could add another English mass in the afternoon.  The church is so nice.
42,4.0,"when our program visiting Korea started from Seoul , there are five church were declared with the holy doors by Papa Fransesco, and I searched the next church with our destinations; the I found this cathedral , which was  built  the first church in 1784, then in 1892 this  beautiful cathedral in gothic style was built.we spent 15 minutes with our pray and wondering the beauty of its altar , then we passing the holy door located on the right side of the church. it is surrounded by a beautiful garden and the back side is the white holy virgin Mary is waiting for you.underneath the garden is a multipurpose hall with nice cafes and restaurant , library and you may take rest within the air conditioned room there.as a Catholic I highly recommend to visit this Cathedral when you visit Seoul. thanks be to God that we had the chance to visit your  beautiful house in Seoul."
43,5.0,I attended the 9pm mass which was in Korean. I did not understand a single word but definitely felt the solemness of the ceremony. I appreciated the gesture of the priests at the end of the mass when they lined-up at the main entrance to bow and thank churchgoers while they were filing-out of the church.
44,5.0,"Historical building, and good for photography spot. It's ancient and it's beautiful. Right in the heart of Myeong-dong province."
45,4.0,I looked forward to visiting the cathedral for the reason that I wanted to attend the mass and witness how (South) Koreans also express their Catholic faith. Was able to attend the English mass and experienced the solemnity of it.
46,5.0,"An amazing structure, so calm and a quiet place to meditate and talk to the Almighty God.. WHat a lovely place to visit and don't forget to take pictures.."
47,5.0,English mass is at 9am on Sundays. We had an Irish priest for mass. He was very interesting. The church is not as ornate as European cathedrals. I wanted to stay and look around but it's back to back masses there and the next group of mass attendees were flowing in as we were finishing. Don't be put off if you see groups eyeing your pew for the 10am mass during the 9am's closing hymn.
48,5.0,"Beautiful, imposing church structure. It has not changed since I first visited it in 2007. A must see!"
49,5.0,"As a person who loves design, I had a great time looking into the building. Very classic and quiet place. It was close to Myeong-dong street, so killing two birds with one stone! There's a little underground mall near this place, and that place was really nice as well"
50,4.0,"Even Im not Christian, I still want to come in here everytime I visit Myeongdong. Sit on a couch, inside or outside the church, at anytime of the day, will calm you down, especially for those hunger for shopping out around the area."
51,5.0,"It's a huge and beautiful cathedral located at the heart of Myeongdong district. It is made out of bricks and it has a wide space which I bet a lot of people could fit in with their families to attend the mass. It's a must visit of you are a Catholic person, well, any person with different religion is welcome anyway!"
52,3.0,"The cathedral was a key location in the political protests of the 70s and 80s, and remains key of course for Roman Catholics in Korea.  The plaza was recently renovated.  The cathedral itself is no particular work of art, but is worth a stroll through the plaza, and a peaceful respectful visit inside."
53,3.0,"Located a bit further off from Myeongdong shopping street and uphill, the cathedral look grand from below. The interior were those of roman/european church."
54,4.0,"This is a catholic cathedral and it was a important symbol of Korean people fighting against the Dictatorship and in favor of Democracy in the 1970s, and 1980s. It is situated at the hearth of Myeong-dong. It is a place where you can find a serenity and to have some time for meditation."
55,4.0,"This cathedral, also known as The Cathedral Church of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception (1898) clearly represents the Catholicism of South Korea. Styled in Gothic Revival Architecture, its red and gray brick facade is actually atypical of its kind but more like a fusion with Korean style facade finish. The structure itself is quite outstanding (but not imposing) being built on a much higher ground than the rest of its adjoining structures. The grounds are well maintained and kept spotlessly ""immaculate"" despite the throngs of tourists that flock the area. The interior is equally magnificent with its high vaulted ceilings, pointed arches and stained glass windows. I missed attending the English mass but heard the Korean version just the same. It was quite solemn and very organized. I got to roam around the grounds afterwards and was impressed by how they incorporated the nearby structures to the style of the cathedral so everything blended together very well. The street where this is located comes alive especially during weekends so one can visit the shops and try the various street food that ply the alleyways. This is a great post-mass activity. Truly a great experience."
56,5.0,Found this to be the perfect place for some serenity after some mad shopping. It has beautiful grounds that lend itself to some quiet meditation. The church itself is beautiful and is an excellent place for prayer.
57,4.0,"although it's quite too far from the subway or i just got confused by the direction in the map, probably one of the highlights of my short stint in Seoul when i attended a mass on a beautiful Sunday, it's a Korean mass, but it doesn't matter. it's a great place for worship, i am amazed on how they practice their worship, they are all quiet and focused"
58,5.0,We attended sunday mass service at Myeongdong Cathderal. The church is situated in busy Myeongdong shopping district yet the mass was very solemn. The doors of church were kept close so you have to check inside to see if there is on going mass.  We are lucky enough to attend mass in English.The church is very beautiful.
59,5.0,"Very interesting tour.  Located near great shopping area of Myeong-dong.  A Korean friend took us for a visit, sharing her memories of her wedding that was held here many years ago.  As luck would have it when we visited a wedding was just finishing and we were able to see the bride and groom in hanbok and traditional attire.  Cathedral is very beautiful."
60,4.0,"It is located in one of the busiest shopping areas of Seoul. It could easily be missed. Although it is located in a busy area, it is somewhat secluded as the street in front it is not the same busy shopping street. It's a lot calmer than the area within the shopping district. It's on the hill and climbing up the stairs is not hard work at all as it was that far and high. I find it rather beautiful. If you like architecture travelling I think it is one to be in the list."
61,2.0,"The cathedral didn't do much for us, it was just another palatial building constructed for the religious. Unfortunately this one doesn't have the jam of most European structures."
62,5.0,"After my first visiting to Seoul in 2004, it was my first time to step in the Cathedral area. The area was stunning with peaceful and worship by all faithfully Christian. Surrounding  by fashion and business, you can find the peace in your life and make it slow as much as you want."
63,5.0,"visiting here at 4 PM, and there are really crowded. I realize that the church just in the middle of Myongdong shopping area. the buildings was amazing and it must visit place. if you're Catholic, you can pray at St Mary or inside the church. I buy some braclete from wood at the shop, and many things to buy for a gift."
64,4.0,"It was a challenge to find because the people we asked were not exactly church-going ones. Of course we understood - South Korea is not a Catholic country making catholic churches a challenge to find.So it was super awesome when we finally found it! A score or so steps up a small hill was this Gothic church that reminded me so much of others just like it in Italy (the Duomo readily came to mind).Being a Sunday, the church was almost full so we decided to head outside first and wait for the mass to finish - we didn't want to disturb worshippers as we took photos. Good idea because at the back of the church there was a garden and a huge statue of the Virgin Mary (of Lourdes). We prayed as we lighted multi-colored candles (available for around 100 won). It was nice to take photos of the church structure and the grounds that we almost forgot we still had to go back inside the church.Once inside, we marvelled at the vaulted ceilings and rose windows that reminded me of ""Pillars of the Earth"" book of Echart Tolle - building a cathedral takes so much time and effort that I was mighty glad there were men and women in the middle ages (especially) who had so much passion and perseverance to surmount adversity (and drama) to make them a reality for future generations to marvel at.Unlike most churches, the cathedral closes its doors at around 7 in the evening (I think). So we had to hurry to the souvenir shop - there we stayed for a lot longer than we planned because there were just too many interesting stuff to buy.We headed back to our hotel with a happy experience (and bags of purchases). But first, we needed to find a resto serving fried rice dishes (we missed eating fried rice so much we were ready to walk until midnight trying to find one!). Fortunately, there was one rice resto right in front of the cathedral! Praying definitely helped!"
65,3.0,I was accidentally passed by this church. I saw a lot of people went in during the evening. It's really beautiful especially with the light of the dawn on top of the church. From what korean friend told me is they are not happy with the tourists trying to take a picture inside while they are chanting. So privacy check first before you take any pictures and BTW Sunday is really crowded you should avoid that.
66,5.0,"This was the recommendation of Sophia, a new Catholic woman who converted when she was 36. She works for tourism industry and I asked her what to do in 12 hours around Seoul. She gave me really good advice and in the middle of all she mentioned this Cathedral. I took my travel partners here first as this was the main place I wanted to visit. We arrived after night Mass, but the organ pipe player was still there. Practicing or just enjoying such fine sound, we were delighted to hear good music while we were visiting. We had a small anecdote here when he"
67,5.0,"I'm pretty impressed by the location of this church. it's surrounded with tons of shops and located on famous shopping area. I joined the Sunday Mass at 9 A.M, it's conducted with English language. it's very fast mass which was only 45 minutes. join the mass if you're Catholic.this church is very beautiful inside and outside, famous with their gothic architecture. the oldest Catholic church in Seoul. The church is open for public but please keep your voice so that it won't be disturb."
68,4.0,"This is a beautifully serene church with its architecture so well intact.  It is the oldest Catholic cathedral in Seoul and if you visit on a Sunday, there is a mass conducted in English.  It is located in the centre of Myeongdong and conveniently accessible via the train.   The compound surrounding the church is also well-kept and houses quite a few beautifully preserved buildings.  Attending the service in such a beautiful building was touching experience."
69,3.0,It's the cathedral in Seoul so have a quick look while you're in Myeongdong. We went there on a Sunday so it was interesting to see how a mass is conducted in Seoul.
70,5.0,"When we first got to Seoul, the first one on my list was to visit this Cathedral. When we went there there were a lot of construction going on so it was easy to locate. A wedding was taking place and the Cathedral was truly a romantic spot. The first thing we did before going around Seoul was to pray here and our trip was indeed so blessed and so memorable!"
71,3.0,"The time when I was there in April 2013, there were still some constructions going on but the main cathedral is still intact. Lovely church with a history, its a picture worthy place to visit.Take a break from shopping and take a walk :)"
72,5.0,"Our trip in Korea was during a weekend so we looked for a church where we can celebrate the mass.  Good thing the place where we stayed, Namsan Guest House, is just walking distance from the Myeongdong Cathedral.They have scheduled masses for foreigners, published in the church's website:  http://www.mdsd.or.kr/english/sundaymass_view.asp?seq=318&bCat1=&t=&f=&bPage=1We went to the English mass on Sunday at 9am.  We had a solemn mass.  The church is beautiful and of course, we had picture taking after the mass :)Outside the church there are lots of beautiful bouquets of flowers sold.  There's Coffee Bean near the church.  The church is very near the Myeongdong Shopping street, so you can go shopping after praying."
73,4.0,"The Myeongdong Cathedral is located in the heart of Myeongdong's shopping area, so it's really convenient if you want to pay it a visit. We didn't spend much time in here as our main objective was to take pictures of the buildings. Worth a visit if you want to take pictures of their constructions."
74,4.0,Great place to get away from the maddening crowd at Myeongdong. Look for the Guides in Red Jackets in Myeondong & they'll be able to point U in the right direction.
