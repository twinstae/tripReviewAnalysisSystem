0,3.0,Be prepared for a strenuous walk up a 45deg incline steep slope as u walk from the subway station to Ihwa Mural Village and Naksan Park.The murals are scattered far apart throughout the village so be prepared to walk more slopes as u look for the murals.
1,3.0,"There are a series of hills to get to the village from the information center and then a series of steep stairs throughout the mural route that would make it difficult for families with small children to complete the tour. We ended up staying on the lower loop and only seeing about half of the murals because the kids were so tired of climbing the hills to get to the town (before we even reached all of the stairs). There’s also a map of the route available at the information center near exit two of 생화 subway stop. The guide told us we could do the tour in an hour with kids but if you’re walking from the information center, 1.5-2 hours might be more realistic without them."
2,5.0,"Loving the trip up to this quaint little village. One of the highlights of our 9D8N trip. Interesting shops around for browsing around. Hubby even bought 2*shirts for KRW10,000! Highly recommended if you want a day out of Seoul city."
3,4.0,"Good for photo. Lots of handicraft shops. Have some cafe for drink, snack and sit for a while. Morning or early afternoon time reccommend."
4,4.0,"Well, the murals may not be as many as it used to be but it was still good to take that stroll up the slope towards Naksan Park. Nice cafe and little eateries as you go mural hunting. Milk Gonghang is a nice place to stop for ice-cream and coffee."
5,4.0,"The climb is steep and long but you Will be rewarded with nice murals and view OF The City. The houses are unique and The murals are varied in theme. There are photos OF The place displayed hanging by some OF The walls. The locals are nice and welcoming. There are café and drinking places with nice balconies at The TOP. A good place to relax, drink and eat."
6,3.0,"We made this a must-see on our second trip to Seoul. It is not an easy place to find - it took us an hour to get to it.The reason that we wanted to visit this Village was the artwork, especially the stairs with fish and sunflowers. Unfortunately, they were gone as we think the local people painted over them (so that outsiders would not come?).We were able to find a few other mural paintings, but not all. We wished that the Village would keep up the murals as they are what makes the Village, regardless of outsiders or not.One advice - getting to the Village requires a lot of walking uphills and up LOTS of stairs. It is a good exercise but not for everyone."
7,4.0,"This place is hilly, so need comfortable walking shoes. Many interesting murals on walls which capture nice photos. There are also many small cafes & shops. I went in the morning & is a quiet neighbourhood & not very crowded.It’s a nice break from the shopping & eating.There is a Naksan Park nearby & noticed that the locals go for hiking."
8,4.0,"Not many visitors to Seoul know about this cool, indie neighborhood not far from Changdeokgung Palace, Bukchon, and Dongdaemun. It's a very hilly residential area where artists have decorated many walls and stairways with cool paintings and mosaics. There are so many cute boutiques, restaurants, and cafes sprinkled throughout the area, you could easily spend all day wandering around. Everything is super Instagramable! If you have mobility issues or young children in tow, the hills may be too much, but for everyone else it makes a great day out - just wear your walking shoes!"
9,4.0,"Even many Seoul dwellers don't know this place. It has lovely cafeterias and tiny shops.- Locating on a hill, seniors may have some difficulties.- Accessible from Daehakro(metro: Hyehwa) and Dongdaemun City Wall Park(metro: Dongdaemun History & Culture Park).- There's Naksan Park with a nice view behind. Good to visit together."

11,5.0,My family chanced upon this interesting mural village while we were tracking our way up the Seoul City Wall trail. The murals added colours and uniqueness to this quite village.  We spent about an hour walking around the village enjoying the murals and some local snack and ice cream. Recommendation : 1. an hour walkabout will be sufficient to see the place. 2. Wear comfortable shoes as there are slopes and many staircases to climb. 3. Go there if only you are interested in something different instead of the normal common touristy places.
12,4.0,"We were here for about two hours. We enjoyed the quietness & the unique beauty of this area. Definitely, the art presentation / paintings of the area are curing & facilitating your photo shooting a lot. We liked the milk shop & another small cafe for the drink & interior design they provided. In the end of the walk, we all agreed this is a very nice place to hangout for two or three hours...我們在這裡待了兩小時，我們很享受這裡的安靜和特別的風味，特別是這裡的壁畫和藝術呈現都很療癒，而且無法停止拍照，我們在牛奶工房和另一家小咖啡店都很享受她的飲料和舒服的裝潢，在離開這一區時我們都同意這區很適合來逛逛、照照、發呆個兩三個小時。"
13,3.0,It's a bit of a climb to get to the nice staircase murals and the artwork is interesting but the trickeye museum is more worth your time. Mural village is free and you get the exercise but don't bring a stroller if you have kids. Also don't talk too loud as people actually live in this village.
14,5.0,"First time to go there. Not hard to find this placeThere is obvious direction so i think you can find it well ^^If you wanna go here, i  recommend to use comfort shoes like sneaker because we need to climb. And bring mineral water because you will need itThis good place to take picture or just wanna feel fresh air and enjoy the view 😊😊😊"
15,3.0,"My sister and I visited the mural village after reading a blog about how cute these murals are decorated around the neighborhood. We walked around the village and took some pictures with cute murals. We kind of expected to see more around the neighborhood but maybe it was just us not looking closely enough. We didn't see many tourists since we went in the morning but we did see a few. As I was walking around, I started to feel bad for the people that live there since they don't get much privacy. There are constantly strangers walking around the neighborhood and taking pictures. I guess they're used to it but I would get annoyed if it got loud with visitors. My sister and I left right after we realized this is where people actually live and should be respectful of their space. Try to keep the volume low and be respectful of their property. :)"
16,1.0,"This used to be a really nice little village to walk through, with many colourful and interesting murals to look at at every corner, where even the electricity and water meters would be decorated. Many tourists would come here to take photos and leave with great memories and even better photos!However, when I visited this place in October, most of the murals were gone. Those that remained, they were barely there either, and the village that was once popular with tourists is now almost like a ghost town. It was very disappointing to see this mural village go, perhaps because too many tourists were swarming the place and disrupting the lives of the residents.Don't go there. It's not worth the visit anymore."
17,4.0,Lots of uphill and downhill routes. You may think twice if you are travelling with children or elderly. Wear sport shoes for this attraction. Nice view from the peak.
18,5.0,"I can spend all day here.  We spent about 5 hours and still didn't get to see the whole village.  When we were there the famous stairs of koi painting and flower painting were renovated.  I don't know if they are going to repaint it back the same way.  There was a building where local vendors sell handmade trinkets and jewelries.  There were 4 tables of vendors which they are not always the same vendors.  I bought bracelets from a guy who made them, he spoke really good english and very friendly.  Do buy fresh delicious milk ice ream from Milk Gongbang.   The shopkeeper was very nice helping us call the taxi.  She kept calling until one agreed to come and when the taxi got lost getting there she kept following through  It was raining by that time."
19,3.0,"The mural here are aplenty but not easy to find and not as many those in Penang. It's also at times dangerous to take photo due to many cars. However, the cafe is very nice here and relaxing time soak in the view."
20,4.0,"We visited this place mid June where the weather was at its best (not hot, not cold and just nice at about 24c).  So it was great for us to stroll around, enjoy the walk/view, cafes and shopping.  It was kind of expected but somehow finding the murals and taking pictures with them still excited us.  Some of the murals resembled those in Trick Eye.  Great to have the same thing here but FREE of charge!"
21,5.0,"The village is so beautiful and lives up to its name, there are many murals located across the village. Come before the sunset and you will see a beautiful view of Seoul during the sunset. The murals, the view, there are so many materials for photography."
22,4.0,"This is quite a nice area to visit for photography & relaxation. A bit of walking uphill though.Tips to location:- Train to Hyehwa Station, take Exit 2.- 500m from subway. Walk straight and take to your left toward the structure.- walk straight again, Take to your left of toward SM Art Hall alley in front of you- Straight and take to your right.- Walk straight again and take to your left when you saw white building in front of you.- Walk straight all the way and up the sloop- Walk straight and take to your right.- Straight again but at the same time, you can find some structure on your left.- Take to your right. After 100 meters, you will find the village"
23,2.0,"In order to visit this village,we had to climb up the hill.It is very tiring.I was expecting it will be easy to find the art.But it is difficult to find it.To me,the art in the hse is not that amazing.Some of the art is in their hm.Quite boring"
24,5.0,"It's a bit of a hike to this village, but the murals are worth it if you like art. There were a lot of local students there as well."
