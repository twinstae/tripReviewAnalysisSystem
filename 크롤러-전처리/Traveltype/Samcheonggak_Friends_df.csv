There was a wedding and the place was very crowded. Perhaps the ambience is more suited to such occasions rather than just a meal.We did not have the set menu but several  Ã  la carte items. Food was nice but not memorable, from exotic abalone to common vegetable pancake. The room and decor were not particularly fancy. Only the buildings and gates were in old Korean style."

The prices are a little high but the service is good and the variety and volume of food is very good. January is not the best time for being outdoors at minus 15 so the main activity was eating, followed by a quick walk around the premises. The view is good. There are tables that can see the view but we chose an interior table. Needless to say, you should like Korean food!"

It's about 10 to 12 minutes bus ride to there.If you would like to dine at the restaurant for Korean course meal, do make a reservation. Since we didn't have any, our lunch was at the Dawon, the terrace where one could still enjoy the mountain view of Mount Bukak.The menu at Dawon is pretty limited to a few items only. Korean dishes and pastas. Friend tried the vegetarian bibimbap while I got the beef bulgogi. Prices was between 14000 to 16500 won.Only two staff to service the floor so, things could get pretty slow. Nevertheless, we took a stroll around the area after lunch, and it was nice stroll. Leaves were of a green, yellow and red, the colours of autumn.Though it was within walking distance to Samcheong-dong (about 20 mins), do take the free shuttle or taxi there as the road leading to Samcheong-dong are meant for cars and not pedestrians."

Unluckily, the service was terrible - taking almost 2 1/2 hours to serve a multi-course lunch, not responding to service bells, having to ask twice for everything. On top of that, on of our guests ordered the beef rib set menu and the beef was tough and flavorless. So disappointed."

However, samcheonggak wasn't one of those nice traditional restaurants.Food is good but nothing is amazing or spectacular. Moreover this is more like a korean european fusion were dishes are microscopic and look fancy to the eye. Which is not what korean cuisine is about. Korean cuisine is more earthy and simple, more traditional and meals should all come at the same time and not one by one like in a french restaurant course. The cadre around the restaurant is lovely and truely amazing in one of the most beautiful place of Seoul. The inside of the restaurant kind of modern fusion style is very average from what u can find in countries like japan in average restaurants.For the price i will pass."
