0,3.0,The mall is connected to the metro station so it's quite convenient to reach. We went on the new year eve for the countdown fireworks but it was smaller scale and not as amazing as compared to the one in 2019. Seems to have a great mix of shopping and food options would consider to come back explore again.
1,3.0,"We visited the Lotte Tower as it was not far from The Westin where we were staying. There was a constant stream of people going in and out so we were intrigued. The entire place is full of designer shops, as well as the surrounding area. We compared prices and they were similar to what you would pay in Australia. Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see. Not a great selection for Men."
2,5.0,"One of the best tours I’ve been on. The views are spectacular from every angle. Our tour guide allotted 2 hours for pictures plus he planned the trip at sunset. Amazing place, a must see."
3,4.0,"We love malls with easy transport access, range of shops which suit different pockets, large variety of restaurants/cafes for refuel and supermarket. Lotte World Mall hits all the right buttons. We spent half a day here and the supermarket was very well-stocked. There is also a floor of specially curated local restaurants which are famous in their regions for specific food. It was a great day for our group."
4,5.0,"On a clear day you can see everything, because it is the only high building near and far. Finished 2 years ago it is the ultimate land mark. A modern elevator brings you up quickly, then you have various viewing platforms, also glass floor to look all the way down. You better love hights!"
5,5.0,Amazing view and scenery from the top of the tower where you can enjoy spectacular view of seoul.similarly you can enjoy the shopping in mall where you can buy alot of branded items.and yes dont forget to take pictures
6,3.0,"This time my kids stuck me in a wheelchair, dicky knees from arthritis. It was a free wheelchair hire. Everything was easily accessible. It was incredibly busy though, The average wait time for a ride was 180 mins!!!! It was a special day though, if you dressed in a school uniform then you got in half price. So, uniforms everywhere. Staff were great though and I went on a few rides. Sometimes even managed to cut a line with my helper. There were still steps to climb though, which the staff were happy to help me with. Beautiful at night due to the lights. A nice way to spend an afternoon evening."
7,5.0,"I had already been up the Namsan Seoul Tower when I went here, so thought it would be about the same. But in my opinion the view from the lotte world tower is even better. And the fact that you can stand on the glass floor on the 118th floor and look down just adds to the experience. There was also a terrance at another floor, which was unfortunatly closed when we were there.The mall is great, with lots of stores. But there are alot of malls like that. The tower is what is truly special."
8,5.0,"Great place to hang out with friends. They have everything you can imagine. Shopping, theatre, places for kids, hotel, office space, residence, you name it. This is the tallest building in Korea and you can spot it anywhere you go in Seoul."
9,5.0,"Everything you'd expect from an upmarket shopping, hotel and office complex here - lots of stores, a cineplex, dining and the Lotte Art Museum. Very crowded on weekends, of course."
10,5.0,"Don’t you know that Lotte World Tower is the fifth highest tower in the world!! We went till 122nd floor~ Such an amazing opportunity for me. I saw how beautiful Seoul City from the sky. Fyi, this tower is the highest tower in Korea. You have to pay 27000won to enjoy this facilities.Pertamanya itu kita naik lift dari lantai 1 ke lantai 117 dalam watu tempuh hanya 1 menit! Sebagian orang didalam lift itu ada yg merasa telinganya sakit. Tapi untungnya aku ga ngerasa apa apa hehe. Boleh deh dicob"

12,4.0,This shopping mall has a wonderful array of up-market stores and boutiques.The food court has a great array of outlets catering to many different tastes.
13,5.0,We went to the top ! Great views and nice places to eat in the mall near the entrance. We arrived by train to jamsil station very easy and had a walk around the lake after.
14,3.0,One of the biggest shopping malls I’ve even been too. You will be able to find almost anything you need on your shopping list here. The mall / tower / Amusement Park is all interconnected by the underground passage.
15,5.0,"Up to 123 floors, the view is awesome with many guid!Lift is super fast plus video showing! *We been to see Kaws holiday from tower which is a really great option.到頂樓觀看全首爾市景真的是一件觀光必做的選擇，比較起目前去過的其他國家這裏的規劃很完善，可以一目暸然各個景點外，環境也很乾淨，搭乘的電梯甚至有播放市景影片！部分區域還有透明地面可以直視一樓非常有趣！！！（雖然會有點暈）"
16,5.0,"Good place and very affordable entrances with ride all you can, but you need to go there morning so that you can enjoy everything."
17,5.0,We had a great afternoon here. The views from the top are fantastic and superior to those from the Namsan Tower on the other side of Seoul. The glass floors were fun albeit scary for the wife which added to the entertainment. Well worth adding to your itinerary if visiting Seoul for more than a few days.
18,3.0,"This mall was quite far from the Seoul city, but you can reach here by using the subway train. We went to this mall because we want to go to the Hard Rock Cafe."
19,5.0,"It was a really great trip to the top of Lotte Tower! It was a bit overcast that day but the views were still spectacular. There are several floors you can go to and there are glass floors you can look through. I would have loved to go to the outside observation areas but it was apparently too cold so they were blocked off. Overall, it was well worth the price. Barely any lines and it wasn't too crowded. Would love to see the views on a clear, sunny day!"
20,5.0,"仕事でロッテホテルワールドに滞在中に立ち寄りました。地下道でつながっているため、便利です。地下一階にチケットカウンターがあります。地上123階、555メートルの高さに、約１分で移動します。世界で５番目に高いビルです。エレベーターに乗車する前の通路が美しかったです。エレベーター内では、花火の映像が楽しめます。外観は、ロッテホテルワールドから撮影したものです。I had to go to for a while business trip to South Korea.This was my first time to go there.And I went to LOTTE WORLD TOWER SEOUL SKY.This Tower is a 123-floor, 554.5metre(1,819 ft) supertallskyscraper located in Seoul, South Korea. It opened to the public on April 3, 2017 and is currently the tallest building in the OECD, and is the 5th tallest building in the world."
21,5.0,"Lotte Tower is the tallest building in Seoul and the 5th tallest building in the world. There is a 123 floor, located songpa-gu district. It is just near jamsil station. You can reach using green line ( line number 2) and use exit 1 or 2. The elevator is like a high speed train,it takes a couple of seconds to reach top of the tower. You can take a good profil photos and also you can catch beautiful city view. It gives you a 360 degree city view. I went up the tower in the evening. I was unlucky that the weather was so foggy. So be sure that the weather is clear. You can go daytime and also evening. Two of these situations give you a different beauty of the city. Han river, Namsan Tower, Gangnmam etc... To go up the tower gives you a valuable opportunity to see all of city districts. The cost wast a little bit expensive but it worth. It was 27000 Won as you see in the photo that I uploaded. . The appropriate time to spend there is approximately between 1 and 1.5 hour. You can stay more because there is no limitation to stay there. There is also cafe and restaurant that you can grab some snacks. Also you can have chance to take some incredible attraction photo when you are in the first floor. They take your photo and when you go up the tower you can buy your photo or  photos from reception which is  located floor 120 or 121. You can print out it there or they give you a scan code and using scan code you can download your smart phone or tablet in that time. The cost was around 10 000 Won as I remember. I think you should try with your friends or family. You will not regret. You can bring your baby, children etc. Don't worry it so safe :)"
22,3.0,was staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul which offers free shuttle to its new and shiny sister hotel in Jamsil.The exterior is very impressive and we even went to the top of the tower with its most interesting elevator ride. However the entry fee to the top is pretty steep and the view is nothing to write home about.The mall itself is like any other shopping mall in Seoul.
23,5.0,"I didn't want to go to this place. Our friends went, so I went. So glad I went. What an experience. Please go onto the plexiglass floor.You'll get that special feeling between thrill and wanting to use the bathroom."
24,5.0,"My friends and I met at Lotte World Mall and spent our day walking around and dining. The mall is huge, right next to the tower and Lotte Department Store. There are many escalators and I especially like the express escalators which skip stores. 1000's of various stores, you can find anything and everthing. Lots of great restaurants and cafes. We ate at Spsin Club and had a lovely dessert at Guylian Chocolate Cafe. We didn't have time to visit the tower but will do so in September when we go bsck to the mall for out seafood dinner."
25,5.0,I have spent some time photographing this building from different sides.  It helps make a very good cityscape pics of Seoul.  Best pics are made if you get to the hills south east of Seoul.  I went with metro line number 5 to Macheon and then climbed the hills.
26,4.0,"This mall houses a lot of things including Lotte World Adventure and the Seoul Sky, the newest skyscraper in Seoul which offers 360deg view of Seoul and the vertigo inducing transparent floor. Though more expensive than N-Seoul Tower, Seoul Sky is more superior and boasts of new interiors and less crowds. The entrance is designed with fantastic LED screens and the elevator is simply wow!"
27,5.0,Good mall but the tower is the best part.  Must do and take your time going to every floor.  Cafe there to eat but we were there to watch a movie so didn't have time.  The glass floor part is the best part.
28,4.0,Incredible building very nice surrounding area! The building itself is spacious/state of the art in every way. It is however expesnive and seems to be catering mostly towards those who are richer. Nothing wrong with that but for me I just walk around there.
29,4.0,Visited the recently opened mall. They have all your shopping needs inside. Also you can take magnificent photograph outside the building. There is a garden with a modern sculptor. Definitely will visit again as the building is massive and not enough time to walk around.
30,4.0,"Went there on a sunny Sunday afternoon. There were quite a lot of people in line at the ticket counters as expected, but since they were very efficient, we just waited for about 10 minutes until we got our tickets. Waiting time for the elevator was then another 15 minutes, which was faster then assumed too.  Adult ticket is 27.000 WON (~25 EUR/26 USD). Kids are about half price. There is also an Express-Ticket for 50.000 WON to pass the lines at the elevator etc.  Going up by the high speed elevator is nice and just takes a minute. The multi-floor observation deck has a coffee lounge, photo stand, souvenir shop and two glass bottom areas. Also there are two outside terraces. Plan to spend about 45 minutes there on the top of the tower, which is enough for sure to see everything. The modern, elegant and big Lotte Mall itself is surely also nice to walk through, however we just went for the Tower."
31,5.0,"This is a must to do, I highly recommend it.  I visited around 10.30 in the morning and there where no lines at all.  Also nice to sit at the bar and have a champagne.  Employees very friendly."
32,5.0,Very nice place it's  a wonderful city full of all. Condition vivamente di visitors Seoul is beautiful city full of surprises.
33,4.0,"Spent a couple hours here in October 2016.  Came for dinner, then did some browsing.  Very large mall with lots of stores including a high end department store.  Many restaurants to dine at.  Part of a conglomeration of many malls in this area.  Easily accessible by metro.  Has a theme park too called lotte world.  Very bright, clean, and modern interior.  Column fountains reaching from floor to ceiling of one of the mall floors that illuminated in a rainbow of colours.  There are movie theatres as well.  PF Changs is here and we had dinner there."
34,5.0,"What I discovered was the Lotte World Tower over 550 meters or 1,800 feet! The architecture in the area was modern and unique. Just behind the world tower you can find Seokchon lake which has a walking track and you can appreciate the area from many angles. Had I known about this place I would have grabbed some food and a drink as there are many areas to sit. Lotte World Tower Hotel is in its final stages of construction and will eventually be linked to this Mall as well. The Lotte World Tower Mall is easily accessible by metro; it is right on top of the Jamsil Station which is a subway interchange between the green and pink lines. The pink line's Jamsil subway exits are linked to the basements of Lotte World Tower Mall itself which has a duplex hypermarket Lotte Mart and a duplex aquarium. The Lotte World Tower Mall main wing also hosts a department store, countless standalone shops and restaurants, a big cineplex (on its upper floors) and Hard Rock Cafe Seoul. The green subway line at Jamsil, and the Lotte World Theme Park across the road are connected to the high end wing Lotte Avenuel Mall. There is a several restaurants on the uppermost floors of Lotte Avenuel Mall that have an excellent view of Seokchon Lake and its surrounding park. An avid shopper will probably find it inadequate to spend an entire day exploring this sprawling 2-in-1 mega mall. The main wing of the Lotte World Mall has all the popular chain stores like H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, etc as well as branches of Korean cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Face Shop, Innisfree, Laneige, etc. I reckon the Lotte World Tower Mall will be a good place to escape from the scorching summer heat or freezing winter weather."
