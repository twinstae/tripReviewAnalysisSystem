0,5.0,"We used the subway frequently. We found it to be cheap, easy to use and extremely clean. Your ticket includes a deposit which you need to redeem."
1,5.0,"Very clean, with good road descriptions. Announcement in 4 different languages including English. You will never lost your way"
2,5.0,"Being the lazy Englishman that I am, it took a while for me to suss out Korean place names and directions of trains, but I soon came to appreciate how efficient the metro was. It was easy to buy tickets from the machines as everything was translated to English at the press of a button! On the  occasions that I was confused, there was always someone to assist when I required help."
3,5.0,-Clean-Easy to use for English speakers-Expansive stations-Extensive system of stations/stops-On time -Safe
4,5.0,"Seoul Subway System is a lot like either New York City or London. 9 million people on the move. For the equivalent of $2 you can go anywhere. We took the #3 line (Orange) from the Underground of the Shinsegae Mall to Insadong. The stops are both numbered and named. The hardest thing might be buying the ticket, but plenty of people willing to help."
5,4.0,An easy way to get around in Seoul.  You can get single trip cards off machines in the station and redeem deposit amount at the end of trip. Would recommend this as an option versus taxis.
6,5.0,Very convenient to bus to and from the metro and incheon airport. Accommodating to guest by all staffs
7,5.0,"There is no better way then you travel by the metro if you want to save money. It is time consuming sitting on the metro to get to your location, but trust me when I say it saves a lot of money. Every time you use the metro, it takes 1250₩. When you transfer, it takes a transfer fee between 200₩ to 500₩. You won’t transfer between a lot of subway lines. Maximum usually three transfers. The subway is very very easy to use, sometimes it can be confusing with all the signs to locate where to go, but they show you in English and say in English what the next stop is. The metro gets very very busy during rush hour. Sometimes you’ll be waiting in line and won’t get on until the third subway that passes by. Usually rush hour is around 4pm – 6pm since that is when people get off work. However, do not be afraid since a new train comes by every 5 – 10 minutes. The subway runs until 12am the latest and there are designated seating area for elders, pregnant women, individuals who have physical accessibility needs, and also individuals with luggages."
8,5.0,Bought T-money for 4000won and topped up 20 000 won which lasted us for 5 days and we still had balance left over. You can use it on both the metro and buses. Can travel very easily from place to place in Seoul with these 2 transport (use google maps for suggested rides). Announcements and signs are also made in English. I believe I have also heard Japanese and Chinese as well (may need verification). Only problem is that there are a lot of stairs and the lift may not be easily found or out of order. So it can be challenging for those with prams or have knee issues.
9,5.0,"The Seoul metro is a sparkling clean, economical and very easy to navigate! it can be a bit crowded at rush hour, but the riders are quiet & respectful of fellow rider’s space."
10,5.0,The subway is extremely easy to use and the local people are always willing to help if you are confused. I used the subway to visit my brother-in-law in Osan and to get to the airport. I highly recommend anyone visiting Seoul to use the Metro during your stay.
11,5.0,Get a Tmoney card and this is so easy to use you just top your card up every now and then but it's so cheap you won't have to often. It's so clean and quiet and on time. Theres also shops and food venders down there as well so worth a look round
12,5.0,"I've used metro systems in several cities but this one takes the cake. Connectivity is excellent and station density depends on the population density around the station so in the heart of Seoul you're never more than a ten minute walk from a station. I found that I could get almost anywhere in the city with a maximum of one train change. Trains are frequent and maps and directions are very easy to understand, even for foreign visitors. The only downside is that the last trains are around midnight and even earlier on weekends."
13,5.0,Very good experience. English signs and clear information. Nothing to be worried  as an foreigner. Also cheap.
14,5.0,"Seoul has the best metro/bus system I've ever used. Make sure to buy a pop card before hand! Also, Naver maps is a great app to use and is English friendly (which some apps are not)."
15,4.0,"I no longer live near large cities with subway systems, so it took a beat to get used to this vast subway system. Fortunately there are apps available to help you navigate with relative ease. Plastic transit cards are available for purchase and it's easy to replenish. There are lots of stairs everywhere, elevators not so much, but they are available. Signs do have English subtitles, but we did find ourselves on platforms going in the opposite direction from what we wanted. We didn't see many attendants, but asked college-age people (who spoke English) for assistance when needed."
16,5.0,The subwAy is inexpensive and easy to use. All of the lines are color coded and all signs are in English. We took it everywhere in the downtown. Best way to beat rush hour traffic. Costs 1400 for a basic ticket.
17,5.0,Very easy to use- make sure you buy a rechargeable T money card in a convenience store or at any station (cash only)
18,5.0,Can travel to all places with the metro. Using the kaokao metro app can help u to travel easily. Just take note of the exits as to see clearly the destination as it will leads to different places.
19,4.0,"With the help of certain app(hanchao if you can read chinese), i can go to most tourist attractions or shopping malls by just seoul metro."
20,4.0,"Some personal tips for new visitors:1. Buy a T-Money card for 3k won. Vending machines in metro stations offer options for 7k, 4k & 3k won. For 3k, you get one regular T-Money card. For 4k, u get a fancy looking card. For 7k, you get 2 fancy-looking cards. (Thankfully, i needed 2 cards this trip!!)2. I can confirm T-Money card saves U time, especially during rush hours. If u take a bus-metro combo trip, u could save a fair bit of money, provided u don't take too long for the transit. 3. Download KoreaTransit app to find the best routes from A to B, typically a combination of bus & metro. This app is not perfect but it's definitely one of the best public transportation app I've used so far. (In my view, better than a couple of Singapore apps I've used for Singapore.)4. One time, I could tap going in, but I couldn't tap out. Red signal came on & gate wouldn't open. No guard or attendant around to help me. Caused me a bit of panic, betore a local showed me to a nearby gate which opened without tapping out. To be sure I wouldn't get ""penalized"" i tapped the in-gate again but didnt go in. I found out next day from card balance i was charged for an ""additional"" trip. But its OK  - ""peace of mind"" for me to know the card still works ok. 5. T-Money worked for me in Seoul & Gyeongju. Understand it will work in Busan where Im heading next. And yes, i can confirm u can recharge at most C-stores without any service fee."
21,3.0,"It is really a comfort train, clean and tidy. But there is no english sign to read where we hv arrived and where will we going to stop."
22,4.0,"This is an easy to use option and best to use when there is heavy street traffic. Unfortunately, we were unable to get seats so had to stand up for 45’. It is a typical subway but is clean and orderly."
23,5.0,We were impressed with how easy it was to use public transportation. Not only is it convenient but also clean and safe. We also found everything to be well marked.
24,5.0,"Bought a T card and relied on the metro and buses. The service is great! Fast, reliable, cheap and safe! Get a card and use this to get around!"
25,5.0,"The metro is the easiest & most efficient way to move around the city. Lines are clearly marked with colour code & numbers. Switching lines is easy, if sometimes a bit of a hike, but transfer lines are clearly marked.The T-money card is so easy to use & top up."
26,5.0,"With both above you will master the Seoul subway within one day. With a purchase of a T-money card we charged it with 30000 won (enough for 4 days full traffic). Follow in the app the station, a hub and a final stop (direction). In the station follow the transfer connection arrows. We reccommend the portable wifi, than follow the stations in the app (subway).."
27,5.0,Fantastic way to get around town. Metro is super clean and really connects you to every part of the city. A map is very helpful as there many lines going all over town
28,5.0,Efficient clean just to be jalouse of a great experience I love the music when the train is coming Only not enough elevator with yong children and a stroller
29,3.0,"First of all the money card is a very good idea: just tap and go anywhere.Avoid rush hours : it can be very busy, if like myself you are no ""Spring Chicken"" don't hesitate to enforce your right to a priority seat! Young Seoulites don't like to give up their seats but will do so if they have to! If you have NAVER Map app. on your mobile it can be very useful when accessing or leaving Metro stations because.  MANY of them have VERY limited escalator  or lift access to street level, and lines are very deep resulting in long,long staircases ! NAVER will tell you where the escalators and lifts are!"
30,5.0,The Seoul Metro is efficient and easy to us. The ticket kiosks have an English option and are not complicated. The trains and stations are clean. People are friendly and helpful if you need it. Signs are clear and readable. Using public transportation provides insights into local people living their lives. The Seoul Metro is great!
31,4.0,We used the Train system to make around Seoul. It was surprisingly easy even with so many different lines and not at all expensive. The trains were clean and no long waits between . Great way to make your way around Seoul.
32,5.0,"Clean, routes well identified, fast and relatively inexpensive to travel via Seoul metro.  Does get crowded at times.  We found evening hours busy.  Still, there was always room to stand even if a seat wasn’t available."
33,4.0,"Was easy to navigate, clean  and very fast. It is quite cheap as well. It is cheaper than taking the bus if you have to take 2 buses. Advice: avoid rush hour because it gets very crowded se pic"
34,5.0,It was our main mode of transport throughout Seoul. Super convenient and reliable. Make sure you buy a t-money card from a convenience store so it makes it super easy and you get big discounts
35,4.0,Great way to get around. Use the numbers on stations for reference as station names sometimes only in Korean. Be careful of express trains - they skip some stations.
36,5.0,"I have been all around the word and rode in many transit systems.  The Korean Metro system has got to be one of the best ones in the world (IMHO).  Easy to navigate, clean, and friendly English speaking staff eager to help."
37,5.0,"A great way to get around Seoul. Punctual, perfectly described stations, clear signs to find the way."
38,5.0,"Seoul's Metro has risen from nothing 50 years go and overall is a great rail network.Station numbering plus bi-lingual signage in Korean and English help one to navigate.A few station interchanges can be confusing to first time users, particularly the larger ones.The Seoul station transfer to AREX is cumbersome but it remains a better option than the airport bus or driving, because the latter two are subject to traffic congestion.Metro trains are frequent, fast between stations safe and extremely clean.  Users tend to be courteous, far more so than in mainland China.The T Money card strangely can only be topped up in cash, but can be purchased using a credit card.  It can be used in Seoul, Busan and other cities, a feature not available with similar public transport smartcards in Australia.There were very few Seoul Metro staff visible.  Platform screen doors minimise injuries though.I did not see any inoperable escalators or lifts.It would be better if which entrances and exits had lifts were more clearly indicated as this would help visitors travelling with luggage as we were, not to mention the elderly, mums with prams, disabled and those with lots of shopping bags."
39,4.0,The metro is a good way to hop around the city and transit to buses. Just get the transportation card (t-money) from any convenient stores.
40,5.0,"Very convenient and expansive metro system. Easy to use, also for foreigners as announcements are also in English. Even the displays on board of the subway trains have English text. The fare is rather low compared to other capitals I have been to.A great way to get around in the city!"
41,5.0,We are a retired couple from Australia.We had 6 days in SeoulOur accommodation was a short walk from Seoul Station.It was a short walk through the Station to the Subway.When buying tickets for our first trip we greatly appreciated help offered by volunteer staff.The Trains are clean and like most large cities can be crowded at peak time.They are frequent and not expensive.A great way to avoid lengthy traffic delays !
42,5.0,With a map on your hands you just go everywhere!!! Only negative point is most of stations has a lot of stairs! No escalator.
43,4.0,". . . what I wouldn't do for a few more escalators, especially when trying to get to Seoul Station and the Airport Express Train."
44,5.0,"Goes very often , much easier than metro in Tokyo , wonderful maps and people kindly assist to help if needed"
45,5.0,make sure you buy the card and charge it with money. if you are going to other cities after you can use it there as well.
46,4.0,Rode metro in both Busan and Seoul.  Trains inpending arrival is alerted by a rousing marching anthem... perhaps to wake up sleeping passengers who may miss the train.   By quiet I especially note Koreans are very polite not talking loudly or blaring music in the metro.
47,3.0,"We often choose a hotel with access to a metro station and in this case the National Assembly. The many routes/lines never seem to go where we needed to be and this meant transfers several times. We are used to Tokyo metro and it has more cars more often and travel times are much quicker. At times, we found the bus service to be better than the subway."
48,3.0,"Using Metro at Seoul is convenient as most tourist  attractions can be reached including DMZ . As Korea is not a highly populated country, Seoul Metro is not busy at all even at rush hours. This is really the best for Tourists in comparing to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, NYC etc. We spent three days with Seoul Metro, our experience is pleasant.The Seoul subway network is just similar to any others in the world and therefore easy to use if you are acquainted with the principles of Subway System. Seoul Metro needs extra effort to update their hardwares. Some trains use PA, some trains use signs for station to station reminder and which side of door to exit.  No electronic Lines/Stations indicators in the cars.  Seoul supposed to be a modern city and the trains shud be more user friendly with more  equipped.Also,  Station Escalators are insufficient and all stations are not Disable Friendly. Worst of all, is the ticket deposit and refund system.  500 Won is the deposit for each ticket and needed to get refund before leaving the station   The Deposit for Tmoney (fare storage card)  is 4000Won but is not refundable.   For tourists, you have to buy and refund in every Metro trip including the Train from Incheon Airport.Luckily, Seoul is not a busy city and the refund machines are not busy as well otherwise is really a waste of time."
49,5.0,The metro is easy to use and the routes are colour coded. The trains are very well air conditioned and the stations are announced in languages including English. If you can read a map getting around is simple. Transit cards are available at all stations and you can recharge at places like 7/11. A very good service.
50,3.0,We used the metro on a few lines.  We got a t-card from one of the machines which was good. We went mainly from Seoul station. It was just your average metro really. The carriages were amazingly air conditioned which is what we wanted one day when it was super hot. It is easy to use and was clean.
51,4.0,"Get a T money card, which is a stored value card, before you travel on the Seoul subway. The T money card will save you on fares and time (versus buying a single trip ticket).The Seoul transit system is easy to use. Do take note of the Line number, colour of the Line and the name of the end station to the direction you are heading to.The train cars are quite clean and there are announcements in Korean and English on the next station it is calling at.I’d noticed that there are not many escalators in the stations so if you are carrying heavy bags do consider whether you wish to use other mode of transport."
52,5.0,"The trains are super clean! Koreans take pride in taking care of their public facility. The signs are available in English,it is clear and easy to read/understand. The rate is very affordable. Throughout my stay in Seoul for 3 days, never had any train delays. During peak, people do not rush to get in. Nearly all of the passengers queue to get in and out. Impressed with the metro service and would recommend to all. Some of the stations may not be disable friendly as I notice they were no escalators for certain exits or lift, but then again I might be wrong. You might want to check prior to traveling. Family friendly. Abundant seats for elderly and pregnant ladies. Thumbs up for that. For trains from Airports, there are certain part of the trains where you can place your luggage bags which makes it more convenient."
53,4.0,"Very good and cheap transportation.We can reach almost all travel spot with this. And if you use it together with the Subway Application of Seoul, they are fantastic."
54,4.0,I was amazed how clean the Metro cars and facilities were.  The Metro service is very efficient and orderly.It was a bit difficult trying to figure out where to go because there’s not too much signage in English but staff are very friendly and helpful.It gets crowded because a lot of people use the Metro which is a testament to how useful and well run it is.  I’m not one for large crowds and tight spaces so if you’re claustrophobic may want to reconsider using the metro.
55,5.0,"The moment we arrived in Seoul we each got a Tpay or Tmoney card. We each added 20,000won and used it everyday for metro and bus. Everytime you pass a gate it shows you the cost and your balance left on your card. Metro cost 1250won one trip. The metro in Seoul is very clean, all exit are numbered, plans are clear and always felt safe. We used Google maps to guide us."
56,4.0,"Always clean, right on time, cheap and safe. Special seats for elderly and disabled, helpfull staff."
57,4.0,"This metro system is one of the best I have been in around the world. It is clean, it is fast, there are shops at almost each stop, there are many stops, and it is a cheap way to get around Seoul. The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because unlike other metro stations, the lines don’t tell you their final destination which makes it a bit difficult to navigate. The other difficulty I experienced was figuring out how to pay to use it. The easiest (and only) way we found was to purchase prepaid T-money cards (or an equivalent) and load them with won at a convenience store. There may be other ways to pay for the metro, but we didn’t understand them. I’m sure for a Korean, it’d make much more sense and be 5 stars.Before using the metro or bus system, ask a guide/hotel front desk for advice for an app that will give you a better understanding of the system. Google maps works to some extent, but it won’t give you exact directions like it does in other countries."
58,4.0,"Used the metro a lot over 5 days and by purchasing a travel card we were able to uses buses and the metro seamlessly. Very clean, well light and efficient"
59,5.0,"Convenient self serve multi lingual Top-up machines. We grabbed a metro stored value card from a convenience store right beside the turnstiles of the nearest station to our hotel.  Followed the prompts of the Top-up kiosks and used cash to add money so we could spend the days exploring Seoul using the Metro. Downloaded an App for quick and easy trip planning between destinations. Rush hour after work let out was crowded, but the rest of the day was pleasant. There are plenty to stairs at every station to reach the platforms - where as other major cities use escalators and moving walkways to get you on your way safely and quickly. Not ideal to use the metro if you have luggage with you.  That point was driven home when we saw a family of 4 struggling with a sleeping toddler in arms, a babe asleep in a pram and two LARGE suitcases trying to carve a place to fit in, on top of juggling the physical load. (Other passengers were just courteous enough to not hinder them ... but we notice a general lack of courtesy towards others here that would make it difficult for people with physical disabilities or a person struggling with baggage or a child stroller etc)."
60,5.0,"Visited in May 2016A lot of connectivities, multiple colours for different line. Clear navigation by downloading the metro app with instruction on which line to go to, and the schedule of arrival of the metro.Clean, and packed with commuters. All in korean so you really need the app"
61,3.0,"The metro map is very handy, but the metro map within the station has to be studied, to take the train going the right way. For older people, like us, the many steps that leads to an exit, is a killer and we decided after a week to abandon the metro"
62,5.0,A true tase of local culture.  Our trip was a true adventure and we met some great local people who were eager to help us out with routes and stops.  The trains were incredible clean and the presence of metro staff members keep things well organized.  VERY safe.
63,5.0,"While the subway map may have made it look a bit daunting, the excellent signage and use of English, for example at the ticket vending machines, meant actual use was relatively simple"
64,5.0,"We also were impressed with the Seoul Metro. It is clean, efficient, safe, well marked with English signs, cheap and convenient. Definitely buy a T-money card (at any station). It is refundable, less a very small deposit, at the end of your trip."
65,5.0,The Metro system of Seoul is a cheap and convenient way to explore the city. Buy a T-money card and you're ready to go.
66,5.0,you can go everywhere by subway in Seoulvery clean and convenient t money cards reduce your time to buy a ticketsit is able to charge at a subway station
67,5.0,"Although confusing finding your way around at times, especially when it's your first visit to Seoul. Just make sure that the metro is going where you want to go?? But that aside it's an amazing and efficient way of getting around and the Uk could learn a lot from them. they run often and mostly on time."
68,5.0,"Make sure you check the next station (in the direction you are heading towards) after the one you are at, to ensure you are going in the correct direction. Most platforms have both direction trains on the same platform. Buy a T-Money Card at a convenience store outside of Seoul Station. The actually $ you are putting on the card needs to be paid in cash. Add more money at the automated machines at any metro station (again cash only).Naver Maps is how we got around everywhere. Rent the WiFi-egg at the airport so that you always have access."
69,4.0,"Seoul is can connected with many lines with different entry and exit. Walking is must, it will take a while to be oriented to use the metro effectively. It is a cheap travelling by metro to go to places of interest. Always know where to exit and where to entry in order to save a fews steps of walking. For example, my longest ride was f 17 stops cost me 2150 won, that is cheap. I strongly recommend to purchase the T Card with stored value instead of buying one way ticket. I was informed that the T Card has no expiry date, and u can always keep for your next visit. I also found that the station and train are clean, but the station are not user friendly, many steps to climb.There are english signage directions in the metro station and also walking directions within the station."
70,5.0,"When travelling in Seoul, the metro is a convenient option to get around. They run frequently, and have numerous connections to different lines, and most areas you will visit are within a 5-10 min walk from the metros. The lines are clearly labelled (lines are numbered) and although it may be confusing at the start to determine the direction, apps such as Kakao Maps and City Mapper were really useful in determining the direction, waiting time and even exit to use to get to your destination. Trains are also clean and comfortable to travel. It may get a little busy during peak hours, but trains are spaced between 3-5 mins apart."
71,5.0,"Seoul metro, combined with nation rail system, has over 15 different lines with frequent stops. One can travel to almost anywhere in Seoul proper with less than $2 per trip including all transfers. It is the most comfortable and clean subway I've experienced in over 12 different cities- including Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, New York, Los Angeles, Edinburgh, Berlin, New Castle, etc. All tracks are completely enclosed by lucite walls with automatic doors so dusts are contained for passengers (and prevents suicide attempts and acidents). All cars and stains are well lit,  temperature controlled and extremely safe. One needs to buy T-money card which can be one time use or loaded with fund and reused. Purchasing this card can be tricky since it is sold by convenient stores within the station,  not at the kiosks- the machine only issues a single ride ticket which has a premium."
72,5.0,"Very easy, efficient and not very expensive.  Very convenient especially for visitors to the city.  The maps are very user friendly and also in English.  The announcements on the train and on platforms were also in English and  Korean.   The metro covers the whole city and getting to ant corner is very easy as long as you can make sure there is credit on your T card. The card can be bought at many convenience store and recharged at the station. Travelling on the Seoul Metro was an enjoyable experience and I recommend any visitor to the city to use it."
73,5.0,"Being from Washington DC, I'm used to what we consider a clean and modern metro system. However, from what I could see the Seoul system as good or more likely better. Frequent trains, extremely extensive and comprehensive lines and stops blanket the metropolitan area, making the old and constantly breaking DC system--with it's meager coverage and expensive fares--seem vastly inferior.Lessons learned: packed at rush hour, expect to stand and be pressed against the other travelers (women should take a note of their comfort with this); and second be prepared for very confusing ticketing machines, which are CASH ONLY (seriously?? this is a big problem in this century), really confusing for even first time Koreans, and even worse with limited English. For example, some machines will cheerfully take your  10,000 Won note, acknowledge the value correctly, think for 5 seconds, and then error out cancelling the entire transaction without explanation--turns out those machines only accept up to 5000 Won notes."
74,4.0,"Music will be played when the train is arriving. Also the Train arrival system showing the info in the LCD is very unique, at least to me. It shows where the train is, 2 stations away."
75,4.0,great place if you want to old Korean women fighting in a very crowded placeand it is warm in the winter
76,4.0,"The subway has great connectivity although you have to walk quite a bit inside to get to the tracks, ticket vending machine available outside. Language a little bit of a problem."
77,5.0,Used the subway system extensively in Korea and was a joy to use and navigate after using the subway in JapanUsed the express train from the airport to seoul and the all stop train from Seoul station back to IncheonWould recommend the all stop as leaves every 15 minutes compared to 45 minutes and only takes an extra 15 minutes to get there at half the priceUsing the subway and navigation was easy and takes you to most of the key areas in SeoulMap availible at stations is very good
78,5.0,"Good, on time, easy. Can go anywhere around Seoul. The cost is acceptable. The service is excellent."
79,4.0,"Easy to use, frequent and cheap. Not many seats so be prepared to stand even in off peak hours. Some stations are quite a long way down and not all have escalators,"
80,4.0,Love the metro.  Not difficult to navigate.  Overall a comfy and clean train..the ride is pretty smooth.
81,2.0,"we hardly find path to enter it with wheelchair, people who saw our need also never help. one of the mid age auntie even short cut our queue while we want to exit. they should consider more for the needs of people, too many stairs, not wheelchair friendly."
82,3.0,"Korea subway Stn is different from Singapore, those who having big luggages you will have trouble climbing up the stairs I myself is physically fit to walkaround each day for 8-10 hours a day during my trip in Korea, To be honest I myself also struggling carry my Luggage going up and down so I decided to take Taxi to the stn."
83,4.0,"some signs are in english and tickets can be bought at machines where english is selectable as language. Dont forget to refund your oneridetickets after arriving, 500 WON refund."
84,4.0,"The metro in Seoul is brilliant, however we found some stations difficult to get out of as they were too confusing. It’s cheap and easy to use otherwise though."
85,5.0,"The subway in Seoul is one of the best subway systems. Very easy to understand cause they separate subway line in a different color also each station have a number if you don’t remember the name instead of that remember the number is easier. If you transfer to the basic zone within 30 minutes exp. you catch a bus then you don't have to pay the fee. But if you transfer to the bus in a different zone you have to pay 100w. At the information counter, you can get a subway map in the English version."
86,5.0,"No matter what city I travel, I always take the metro system and Seoul was my latest adventure.  I was ready for almost anything, but what I encountered was amazing.Not only is the metro system efficient, it is extraordinarily clean and easy to use.  Once you navigate through the language barrier you have no problem whatsoever.  It is relatively inexpensive to travel across Seoul and you avoid the heavy traffic.  Of course, you want to stay away from rush hour if you can as Seoul is a densely populated city with a large number of commuters.The cars are comfortable and everyone is extraordinarily helpful and polite.  Loved the system."
87,5.0,"As a first timer in Seoul, it was great to find that the Seoul Metro was very easy to use. I also downloaded an App called 'subway' which was a map of the system just in case! All the names are in Korean & English. I must also mention that there is a large number of public toilets in the subway system and they are all sparkling clean! Very impressive!"
88,5.0,"Don't be afraid of using local transportation! All signs were also in English and there is always someone around that speaks English to help. The cost is cheap, you buy a card load it up with some money and you are all set. It took us 1 day to learn the basics. Be adventurous and hop on the metro or even a bus, it is the best way to experience locals."
89,5.0,"Very convenience to go around places, easy to use. We bought T money from convenience store and use it to travel around. We can top up the credits in the metro. 👍🏼"
90,5.0,"The subway come very frequently and clean.  Many passengers are well mannered when it comes to onboarding and offboarding, except there is a certain category, that seem self entitled.  Of course, this also applies to other countries."
91,5.0,"This subway map is a nightmare to figure out because there are so many train lines.Charge is about usd1.2 per trip.User a stored value card that can be bought at the convenience store, and refunded there also.Always stuck in traffic jams most of the day."
92,5.0,Underground on the green line is really good. Every in - 1 min 20 seconds there is a station. Therefore anyone near this large looping green line can access stations on this line.  It crosses the majority of other important lines both sides of the river ticketing machines are littered everywhere in multiple areas and is cheap. This trip of some 14 stations was approx $1.60 the same taxi trip costs $ 12 but more direct but depending on time of day quicker.  Peak hour the train a quicker. If it’s raining catch a taxi as walking from station to your hotel there is a genuine lack of lean too roofing on pavements (winter snow is heavy) travel on train is comfortable and old people have priority and seats at end of each carriage. signposting at stations very good with directions of trains and above ground street directions easy to see and understand.
93,3.0,"Be careful before throwing your metro ticket you can get some money back from it, or recharge it for another voyage"
94,4.0,"Our 5 day experience with Seoul Subway was a breeze. We downloaded Subway app on our phone and it really helps especially when we need to change line, because sometimes the signboards are confusing as they list down several stations along the line. and oh the stations are very clean."
95,5.0,"We used the Seoul Metro for our 3 day visit to Seoul after purchasing our TMoney Card at the Airport. Compared to our recent use of Metro in Milan, Barcelona and experiences of same in Hongkong and Singapore, differences are:- Stations felt safe and free of pick-pocket types compared to the two in Europe.- overall system appears very complex, but taking time to study the map gets you to most places in Seoul easily.- Stations always have restrooms, mostly very clean, elevators are available for those less able to use the plentiful stairs.- one way fares appeared to be fixed at 1250₩ (US$1.10) for each our trips.- At this point in time, Google Map on my Cell Phone (or wife's iPhoneX) is no help finding routes from one spot to the next. I had to use search to find destination and then locate myself and decide which streets to use.My other learning is that the Metro coverage of the middle of Seoul is quite good, several stations from two or more Lines would be near the destination required, checking first may save walking further through some very crowded areas.-"
96,5.0,"We used the Seoul transport system with ease. We caught the fast train from the airport to Seoul Station, the trip takes around 45 minutes. The next 3 days we used the trains to get around the city and it is so quick and diverse. The ticket machines can convert to English so they are easy to use. Highly recommended this transport."
97,4.0,"My wife and I used the Seoul Metro system with ease. The machines are easy to use to get your tickets ( Yes, you can convert the screen to English). The trains are very clean and spacious. Very happy"
98,5.0,"Living in shanghai and being a daily metro user I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the metro is very convenient. Also runs past 12am, which surprised me."
99,5.0,The Metro in Seoul is efficient and very punctual. The journey from each metro station to the next metro station takes approximately 2-3 minutes and the stations are close to many places of interest. It will be more convenient if you own a T-Money card.
100,5.0,"The Metro is fast and efficient, similar to the Metro in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore. I recommend downloading the KaKao Metro mobile phone app when in Korea as it helps immensely. The only “downside” of the Metro in Seoul is that the locals tend to be a bit pushy when entering the train, but I supposed that’s a usual thing."
101,4.0,"It's one of the most efficient and convenient mode of transport in Korea. But do be ready to climb the many, many steps when getting out from the stations. I really hope they will consider installing escalators at all the stations as the climb from the station to road level is so tiresome (averaging 50 to 60 steps)."
102,5.0,"The Rail+ card is cheaper than the Tmoney or other transpo card available (1,000 won only)All lines are easy to use and with English text all over the place. There are only few lines that platform for both directions are not side by side."
103,5.0,"I would highly recommend buying the t-money card and load some $ inside. You can use the T-money card for your rides and also many convenient store also takes it, so you can make purchases with the card. The metro system is great, on time and easy to navigate. The price is not bad either, around 1250 won for a trip up to 10km. You can also transfer from and to bus for free. Just make sure you tap the transfer area before getting off the bus."
104,5.0,"I think this is the best thing to do, because even locals do it. Enjoy the train ride which is easy and comfortable. The maps is confusing like a dictionary"
105,4.0,We spent 5 days in Seoul exploring various sites in the city almost entirely using the metro. This is the most efficient and economical way of moving around this sprawling capital city with many attractions located within walking distance of metro stations. Another big plus is that there are many toilets at the metro stations which was a very pleasant surprise. Most other major city metros are very stingy on offering toilet facilities for whatever reasons. Seoul metro scores number one on my list on this.
106,5.0,Near to all or most tourist attractions. You also should stay near to Myeongdong station or Chungmuro Station. It's so convenient!
107,5.0,"Piece of cake to use - clear instructions, very civilized and very clean. You definitely do not need a taxi."
108,5.0,"One of the best subway systems in the world. It's a safe, clean, comfort, convenient, recommended for everyone visiting Seoul."
109,5.0,"sometimes might confusing, but cheap price, good transportation I used Line no.2 and 3 most. And during traffic hours, its best!"
110,3.0,"I have been travelled metro many time many different cities and this metro was most confusing me. Metro itself cover most arwa of Seoul and using public transport is always good choice. So, when you plan to visit in Seoul, use metro but take your time to get understand how to get place to place."
111,5.0,"Its a best way to reach places in Seoul, very efficient and integrated, simple and easy to understand"
112,5.0,The English on maps and brochures are limited. You really need to ask for help at the info desks to make sure you know where to go and on which lines to step over if needed. The people are friendly and willing to help.
113,4.0,"Can be confusing. Ticket machines take coins and small notes. There is usually a note changer machine if you only have big notes. There is an English option. There are also ticket refund machines, you get 500 won refund by returning the ticket. Signs alternate between Korean and English. Express trains don’t stop at every station so watch out for that."
114,5.0,Great location for shopping! Staff was excellent knowledgeable on places to go an see excursions!  Executive longe had great food and snacks along with spirts and wine for their guest!
115,5.0,"We used the metro a lot and had zero problems. Efficient, clean and modern. Crowded only on peak hours."
116,5.0,"Our apartment wasn't far from the metro. It was easy to navigate, there were ticket machines in both Korean and English. The tickets were also refundable on completion of your journey. The first time we went we got lost deep underground, but once we knew where we were it was great. THE EATING HALL ON THE TOP LEVEL OF THE STATION WAS ALSO WONDERFUL."
117,5.0,Very efficient and easy and cheap to use. Once you know where you want to visit you just follow the signs to correct line. Can be very busy and don't expect to be able to sit down!
118,4.0,"It may seem complicated when you looked at the map. But with Seoul Metro app, your trip will be easy and comfortable. The metro station will take you anywhere you want to visit. It's very convenient and almost all stations has wide shopping underground!"
119,5.0,I went to dongdaemun by subway from city hall front office with my wiwfe.I have benefited from national merit as a vietnam war veteran.the staff in the area really kindly helped us to buy a ticket by pointing us to a ticket purchasing machine. and very cleaning in the subway.
120,5.0,Very easy to use. You need to use t money card which you can find every where. If you are a tourist you can buy discover seoul pass and use it also as transportation card.
121,5.0,"First, download KakaoMetro and Google Translate.  KakaoMetro will tell you which subways to catch and the times they arrive, and Google Translate will help when things are not in your language.  Use the ‘Camera’ to take a picture of something written and it will translate for you, or ‘Voice’ and talk into your phone to have it translate and then show your phone to someone."
122,5.0,"It's clean and the trains are almost always on time, we did not have any problems finding our destinations."
123,5.0,Possibly the easiest metro ever. Get a T money card for 500won load it in the english machines.... Then off you go!
124,4.0,Found the subway easy to use and the terminals are in english. They are fast and very well located to key locations if you are a visitor
125,4.0,"The Seoul Metro is definitely a great way to travel around Seoul. The issue I have is, most destinations require transit by bus or it’s just a long walk to the metro stations. Perhaps the network needs to be more extensive?"
126,5.0,"Terrific subway system (similar to Tokyo) which took us everywhere we wanted to go around Seoul.  System is easy to use, runs often and is clean.  Ticket machines and metro signs are in english and most rides are under $2.00.  You can buy a trip ticket which will require getting a 500 won refund after each trip (for the ticket stub).  Otherwise you can use the T-money card (purchased at convenience stores) which you can load up with won in advance.  You can use the t-money card to make purchases at convenience stores and on buses too.  If riding on metro (with t-money card) you can transfer to a bus with no fee if used within one hour.  However card costs 3000 won non-refundable but will give you a discount of 100 won per trip."
127,5.0,"Being complete outsiders in the city, we had no idea about getting around but each metro station was very informative and the help gates very useful when we needed help. A lot of it is digitized unlike in many other metro cities."
128,5.0,"I've traveled to multiple metropolitan areas in the past decade (London, New York, Los Angeles, Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, and Moscow) and none of them have lived up to the quality and ease of use of the Seoul subway system. The subway cars are new, clean, and easy to navigate, and I've never felt unsafe using the subway even at 2AM. I've heard good things about the Tokyo subway, and I'll have to see if its comparable to Seoul's when I visit,"
129,5.0,The metro system is a great way to travel within Seoul. It’s easy and the staff there are very happy to answer your queries for directions.
130,5.0,"So simple to use, fun to run around South Korea in! You can go wherever you want using the Seoul Metro system."
131,4.0,"I guess those of you who have lived in cities with subway systems, this is old hat to you, but for me it was a bit intimidating at first. They try to help with numbering the different lines and even color coding them on their maps. They run frequently so there is no worry if you miss one or get off at the wrong stop, like I did a couple of times. But toward the end of my stay in Seoul, I noticed that along with the numbering and color codings, the stops all have 3 digits and the first digit always refers to the line number. Daaaaaa. I guess I just became a genius...lol. Anyway, it was an experience but I felt that the subway system in Hong Kong was easier to use and far less scary. Probably it was because Hong Kong's is smaller. Have fun travelers!"
132,5.0,Easy to use even without reading or speaking Korean.  Clean on time trains.Stations have shops food and bathrooms.Get the Seoul metro app and it will tell you times and also bus connections.
133,5.0,The subway is one of the most extensive and reasonable that I have ever seen anywhere in the world. The subway is clean and very well sign posted even for those of us who don’t speak Korean.
134,5.0,"I never rode a subway before, but they have an app that helps you find the route you need. It also can work offline. The subways were always on time."
135,5.0,"We spent a month in Seoul and only used a taxi on a late night out when the metro was not running (3 am or so). It is much wider than Those in European cities so even in peak hours there is room to enter and leave, albeit crowded as expected in such a big city.Save some money and ride like the locals!"
136,5.0,"Easily, one of the most convenient subways in Asia! There are underground markets and shops and ample English signages to help foreigners."
137,5.0,"Puts the NYC subways to shame.  It is on time, clean, quiet and has an app you can download that tells you where you go, how long it will take, the fare, what side of the train the doors open on and which exit stairs go where."
138,5.0,"It was amazingly cheap for us to commute from place to place on the metro trains. Destinations, in English, are sometimes announced, but always indicated on digital boards. It's very convenient with the Korea Travel Card which is a debit card. Trains are fast, clean and punctual, and take you near enough to all tourist sites."
139,5.0,"An excellent metro system with large number of stations, clean, short wait-time and being orderly used by commuters.Too much stairs to climb for old folks.Inadequate information for 1st time non-Korean speaking visitors to quickly get familiar with the use of the system."
140,5.0,LOVED using the metro in Seoul! It's quite easy AND cheap to get around town and to the most visited areas of the city!
141,5.0,"Most stations don’t have ticket offices but you can buy a travel card from the machine in any station and top this up to travel anywhere on the transport system in Seoul. (It comes with a handy map of the Seoul system.) The metro system is easy to understand and navigate with signs and announcements in Korean, English and Mandarin. The card can be used for purchases and topped up in 7 Eleven and other convenience stores.You can also use the same card in other parts of Korea. We used it on the buses, including the airport shuttle, on Jeju Island."
142,5.0,"Got to love accessible, clean, easy to understand and transfer system. Avoid the work commuters hours for a relaxed ride. Some stations have a long walk to transfer to another line.  WiFi is available system wide. Handicapped accessible."
143,5.0,"I have  visited Seoul many times previously but have always used either hire cars or taxis to move around Sth Korea"". But we decided to HSE the Selul Metro as it beats the oeAk hour traffic if Seoul.  We caught a metro train lon line 2 from station 212(hospital)  to 216 alas the river near Lotte WorldFrom getting tickets from the vending machine to following the easily distinguishing sign posts we found the right platform and sideWaiting time minimal and comfort if boarding and alighting metro train easy.   At our getting off station we placed our ticket in a vending machine and received a refund if our unused portion of ticket - pretty good eh"
144,4.0,"The Metro is a very cheap and convenient way to move around Seoul. It is easy the understand the maps, and people always came up to us and made sure we knew where we were going - very friendly and helpful."
145,4.0,"This is the 2nd time we visited Seoul. Seoul Metro is very convenient as it reaches many places. Frequency of train is good, direction is clear, stations are clean & tidy.It has clear English announcement to tell the name of next station and what lines of trains can be transferred.Nevertheless it’s not every train has English name or number of station shown, sometimes neither on route map in compartment nor screen (old train doesn’t have screen) thus you have to pay attention to listen what station it will be > <"
146,5.0,"Easy to use with T Money card, always felt very safe and an inexpensive way to see all of Seoul.  The only tricky part is working out which exit to take!"
147,4.0,"We only has a day in Korea but used the metro from the airport into town its a 1.5 hour journey but its clean and is so much bigger than the Lonond tube system so no problems with baggage. We bought 2 single tickets from the airport to Dongdaemun stion for  9500 but you ger 500 back from each ticket if you pop your tickets in the recycle machine at the end of your journey as they are plastic. The limosine bus takes aprox the same time but is 10,000 each.  Be prepared to walk a long time underground to get to conecting lines otherwise a great service"
148,5.0,"I relied on the Seoul Metro daily while visiting. There are subway entrances and exits throughout Seoul, and purchasing tickets were simple even for us tourists. The metro was always on time, clean, and efficient. Try to avoid rush hour if you can, it can get packed! The map for the metro was easy to get used to, once you get the schedule down, you can get around anywhere within Seoul."
149,4.0,We are a middle aged couple and travelled a fair bit on the subway.With a good subway map and planning where to go the system is easy to navigate. The ticket machines are easy to operate and signs in English so with a bit of patience everything works well.
150,5.0,We experienced a lot of metro in different countries all around the world and this was among the best. Very clean and always on time. Very useful to go around this big city
151,5.0,"Seoul has, arguably, the world's best metro network. It covers the entire city like a giant spider web and you are never too far from a station. The trains arrive frequently, tickets are cheap and, bring underground, you avoid the traffic jams. The carriages are spacious and air conditioned, while the stations are clean and brightly lit."
152,5.0,Wherever I travel I like to experience the local metro. The Seoul metro was super easy to navigate.  The ticket machines are in multiple languages and selecting the from/to stops to purchase a tickets was a breeze.  The cars are very clear and run efficiently.
153,5.0,"We bought T-money cards from a 7/11, topped them up using the recharge terminals at the metro stations, and used the metro to travel all over Seoul. Cheap, easy to use and fast. We found the maps especially easy to read. No worries for those who don't read Korean, all station names etc. are displayed in both Korean and English script."
154,5.0,"Very easy to use subway system, cheap and all ticket vending machines are in English aswell as many other languages. Very clean but very busy during rush hour just the same as any big city. There is normally a digital display onboard the train that announces every stop in Korean and English which is also a big help."
155,5.0,You can get to anywhere in seoul with this superb metro train. Affordable and convenient. Always on time and clean.
156,4.0,"We found the Seoul Metro easy to use, we even transferred lines.  The system is color coded and mapped out."
157,4.0,Good transportation system and very systematic.Convenience and cheap too..Have signage so you will not be lost
158,5.0,"where are the trash? the graffiti? crazy people? Not at Seoul Metro! I've never seen such a clean efficient metro system! The map is a little daunting at first because of the difficult Korean names, and the multiple colored lines, but once you get the hang of it, its so easy! I downloaded Kakao Metro, and it actually will map out the lines for you to take. Highly recommend downloading that app!"
159,4.0,I really enjoyed navigating the subway system. Coupled with the Naver Map app you can find your way around with ease!
160,3.0,long walk line connections....MRT is a older system than in HK...some 150 -200m line connections w/ tunnels....only moving walk walk was nr air express station  all tunnels walk...i gues winter is cold up there..
161,5.0,Seoul metro is always on time. It has wifi with excellent signal and we love it. This transport system is so efficient and thus we are confident that we will reach all our destinations without delay. Thanks.
162,4.0,The metro system is inexpensive and a great way to get around.  It is not as easy to use as some other countries have been however if you allow yourself a few extra minutes to get your bearings and to read the maps you should be fine.The ticket machines took cash only and seemed to only want more crisp bills.Sometimes there is a wait between trains.We used the system numerous times.
163,3.0,The Seoul metro is a great way to experience all parts of the Seoul metropolitan area. But it is a bit confusing at first and if a person has mobility issues it can be difficult. Escalator and elevators seem to be few and far between. If someone can climb stairs it is a great way to get around town. We used both the subways and the bus system.
164,4.0,"Travelling around Seoul on their Metro is easy. Tourist who do not understand Korean will have to keep close attention to the electronic message board, which will show the where next train stop is. The message also flash once, that is why we need to pay close attention. Most tourist spots are accessible by the Metro lines."
165,4.0,"Very user- friendly, especially if you have a T- money card. Ticket machines and route maps are in English as well as Korean and all stations have  neighbourhood maps and tourist attractions marked clearly with the right exit information."
166,5.0,"The metro is the easiest way to see everything in Seoul.  There are maps that can be printed online, or printed maps at every hotel, or posted maps in every station.  We purchased a 24 hour unlimited ride pass and it was well worth the price."
167,5.0,"We visited London, New York City and Kyoto recently and Seoul has the cleanest and easiest subway system to use of all of them (we’re from Boston.) We loaded the Kakao Metro app, which made it easy to navigate."
168,3.0,Getting around Seoul is easy once you figure out how they label the metro.  It’s a little more confusing than some other cities at first. It after a couple of rides you’ll have no problems.  The locals are also extremely friendly and will point you in the right direction so don’t worry about asking for help.  Grab yourself a t money card and jump on the train!  Side note: even if you don’t plan to ride the rails while you are there I strongly recommend you do at least once so you can see the gas masks kept on the platform for emergencies.  It’s pretty surreal.
169,4.0,"The metro is comfortable, quiet and reliable. Efficient, clean and comfortable. Allocated seats too. Finding where to line up for our carriage was a challenge as we were first-time users. Look on the ground for your carriage number."
170,5.0,"Clean, efficient, easy to navigate, inexpensive, a great way to get around the city. Signage is bilingual (English and Korean)."
171,5.0,"The easy access, clean, good manage made Seoul metro among the excellent public transport system. Additionally, assistant for metro user made it better. However, the best part of it is an elderly who proficient in English that stand at the main exit that kindly introduce you a famous place around there and give you some tip such as good points to take a photo.Thank you all grandpa/ma for excellent advice."
172,4.0,"المترو نظيف و سهل الاستخدام و يوجد لغه انجليزيه في الجهاز، و يوجد مكتب معلومات عند الحاجه لأي معلومه اضافيه.Its user friendly it has english langue,   There is a information office that can help"
173,5.0,"This is by far one of the better metro systems I've used. Its clean, efficient and very reasonably priced. The music plays when the train is approaching the platform, many monitors showing you train locations, and glass doors to prevent people from falling onto the tracks. Overall a fabulous city transit!"
174,3.0,"Amazed that this is the top rated thing to do in Seoul. Surely just because so many people have reviewed it? The metro is very efficient and easy to understand but then so many other modern networks across the world are too. It's no better to those elsewhere in the region such as Tokyo, Singapore or Hong Kong. No doubt you'll find yourself on the metro but don't make a special trip because it is just an underground train network."
175,5.0,"The best way to move around in the city. Coming from Europe, the most incredible thing I could never even have imagined, is that every metro station has clean, nice and free toilets without weirdous, addicts etc hanging around"
176,5.0,Clean and easy to navigate the metro system. Stations are plentiful. Purchase a travel card and add money to it. Makes getting on and off each time easier.
177,5.0,"This was amazingingly simple, cheap and easy to use. It has stops in all the hotspots and is easy to use to get around."
178,5.0,The metro system across Seoul is the most convenient mode of transport. Help is also easily available at the station and most of the instructions are in English so it's easy to comprehend for foreigners. The underground station markets are also good for shopping/grabbing a quick bite.
179,5.0,"The metro is a super easy (once you get the hang of it) way to get around Seoul. All stations are in both English and Korean, as are all announcements whilst on the train. Whilst it is easy to get around, don’t underestimate the size of the city, nor the transfer times you might need to change lines."
180,5.0,"Rode the metro the 7 days we were in Seoul.  We were able to get around as the signs were in English.  Metro was, for the most part, clean, with some stations having shops.  The rail map looks complicated but easy to figure out."
181,5.0,Subway is very efficient and reasonably priced.  Best to by a subway rechargeable card.  Can by at 7 eleven and other places.  Just tap going and coming.  Add money to card anytime.  Can get close to most Seoul tourist locations.
182,5.0,The Seoul metro is great. I highly recommend downloading the Seoul Metro App and also buy a T card. Both will make traveling so much easier.
183,5.0,"Easy to use whenever you want to go anywhere in the seoul city area. You need a pass or travel card like as RailPass, Tmoney, CashBee. You can those card from 7eleven, Ministop and CU retail chain."
184,4.0,"We found the metro quite easy to follow and use. However, we have used metros all over the world. Some could find it daunting! Be prepared for multi levels and long passages. Keep the tickets for a souvenir 😄"
185,5.0,"So easy to navigate and get around Seoul on the Metro (and cheap!). The Metro card is easy to buy from a vending machine and you can top it up at any CU, GS25 or other convenience store which are found everywhere and pretty much always open. Card was only about 4,000 won I think but you can buy 'couples' cards - saving 1,000 won which we didn't realise til after we brought two separate cards. Trips were only 1,250 (I think) or there abouts but when you tap off and on through the gates you get a balance - same as when you top up at a store. You only save a small amount by having the travel card but it is so convenient to not have to deal with cash for every trip. We barely waited for more than 5 minutes at any stop (and we used it a lot!) Definitely a brilliant way to explore Seoul."
186,5.0,The metro is convenient and price is normal. Just that sometimes may be too many people. Recommended to use
187,5.0,so so easy to navigate i was a bit scared at first as i wasn't sure if it was going to be easy to navigate but it was more than easy always on time and very very clean :)
188,5.0,I have been in Seoul for 6 days and used the metro trains 3 times. It is safe and clean and I would recommend traveling by train. The names of stations are in Koreanand English and the announcement on the train line and in the train for each station are in English.There are a number of things you need to know. 1. Check line number as each one is a different colour. Check subway map for line numbers.2. When you go to the line platform work out where your station is in relation to which direction the train is going. There are signs that state which platform is going to which station eg. we got on in City Hall on line 2 (green) and traveled towards Jamsil station (as our stop was Samseong).3. Once you get to your station there are often 6-8 exits each putting you above ground in different directions. Look at map on subway wall for the exit you need.4. Cost is cheap with a 45 min ride costing $5AUD or $3900 won for 2 of us.Korean people were helpful. Although not all spoke English there were a few that could.
189,4.0,"Very comfortable to use and easy when you get use to. You have to buy your ticket in the vending machine, be careful writing the destination you want to go (not fixed price, but per destination).The line 2 (cercos one) is very useful to go to many destinations and also Line 1. Stations are big and many stairs, be ready to walk and check your exit number to be close to your destination.If you buy a one way ticket, like we did, you are charged KRW500 per ticket as a deposit which is fully refundable after the trip. There are machines to refund deposit after last check out.Easy, big, check your line number and don’t get confused with the exit numbers (it can happen)"
190,5.0,"Great subway system, clean and efficient. Good signage in Korean and English. Like detailed maps on which exit to use. Buy yourself a ""T Money "" card. There are self service vending machines at most stations, you buy your card (3000) then you choose how much money to put on it and charge it up. All simple with English instructions. Min cost of journeys was 1250 in Seoul and 1300 in Busan. Just under a pound ! Then you are ready to go local! Tap your card in, your shown amount taken and balance left. Tap out at journey end - if any additional taken this is shown with balance. You will be amazed how far £1 gets you!  You are not charged for transfers between lines.Dont worry about leaving loads of money on the card when its time to go home.......you can get a refund, only place to do this at Incheon Airport T1 was the CU store on level 1. Our refunds paid for breakfast at airport. You dont get your 3000 back for the card - you keep the cards.To charge up your cards you can use machines at stations or find local CU stores and they can also do it."
191,5.0,Perhaps one of top metro systems in the world. Both the trains and the stations are well maintained and CLEAN. All stations have arrival information of trains.
192,4.0,Clean and efficient.  Be ready to climb a lot of stairs as not all stations are handicapped-friendly.   Not every station has escalators.
193,5.0,Spent a long weekend in Seould and the metro is a great way to get round the city.  Signs in the trains are in English which is a great help and you can get a travel ticket which you simply swipe like a contactless card / oyster card.  You have to buy the card outside / away from the stations so beware but from then on it is simple.  Just top up and go.  GReat.  Why can the UK work in such a simple format
194,5.0,I stayed this hotel few days . It was amazing dayI really like it . The stuff were very very kind ❤️Thank you for everything
195,5.0,"It's easy to travel with Seoul Metro as the signboards of 4 different languages (Korea, English, Chinese and Japanese) are very helpful. It's efficient and the rate is diverse."
196,5.0,Can be very busy and comfortable at peak hours. Very efficient to the minute.The underground subway transports millions of people everyday without a problem. Unbelievably geniusly designed.
197,4.0,I was so blown away by how clean and lovely the subways are! As a New Yorker I am a veteran . . . and an added benefit is all the underground shopping!
198,5.0,"Clean, efficient and easy to navigate!One thing i notice, which is a cultural thing, i believe. No one says 'excuse me' when they're trying to pass you on the train or even anywhere....on the bus....they just squeeze by...but Seoul Metro is great. Get a T-Money card and you can refill it as often as you like and can even use it at stores to purchase things. it works both for buses and trains."
199,5.0,"Easy to get around then surface traffic.  Skip the taxi and use the subway.  Cheap, clean and once you know your sto, pretty straightforward"
200,4.0,"Very well connected, fast and convenient. Slightly confusing to read the signs as I was more used to the Japanese rail network where the lines have names. Here they are numbered. Directions on platforms are little difficult to understand, but once you get a hang of it, very good."
201,5.0,"With a little map, you will have no problems understanding the colour codes and exists.Opt to pay with TMoney or just purchase single journey tickets. If you opt for the latter, remember to claim back a 500 won deposit."
202,4.0,"Just be sure to look at the map with the English/romanised station stops and you are good to go. You will need good eyesight and good colour differentiation to work out the myriad of lines. We bought the single trip tickets through the machines.  Do remember to claim back your 500 won deposit after your ride - you will be surprised to hear that prompt in English as it follows the language in which you bought your tickets. Toilets are available at the stations -  very clean and well maintained, and FOC too"
203,5.0,Very convenient and great service of transportation among the Seoul city.its really helpful for a budget traveler to move around the city quick and easy
204,5.0,"For a tourist they are not so easy... we had a guide with us so it was no problems. They are fast, clean, so just go on it."
205,4.0,"I always prefer travelling overground but in Seoul, where traffic could get really bad, the metro could be the best bet. However, when you have to transit between lines, be aware that you might have to walk quite a bit."
206,4.0,The  Seoul metro is very clean and comfortable.   The best way to get around a busy city to avoid any traffic jams.   Using the T money card is very convenient and easy; just touch the reader pad at the metro station entrance gate and again touch the pad at the station exit gate.    A disadvantage is  many stations  have stairs so with heavy luggage it is difficult to access the trains.   Lifts are available but not easy to find.
207,5.0,"Don't hesitate to use the Seoul Metro - it made traveling around Seoul incredibly easy for us. The only thing I'd say is that there are MANY stairs, so it's not the best for having a stroller or mobility issues. There are elevators, but it still could be a difficult system to navigate if you have mobility concerns."
208,4.0,Get a season pass if you staying more than 3 days. It's cheaper and it's convenient because it can be use for other mode of public transport and it's refundable at the end of your trip
209,5.0,"Wide covered network, easy to ride to most popular view points.With clearly indication in each station in English. Clean and tidy compartment.Price reasonable."
210,4.0,"Easy to use the metro, but many different lines and you need to make sure you are going in the right direction, so check a map and if you are lucky you can find an English speaker to help"
211,5.0,We used the Seoul subway on many occasions during our 3 day visit and found it to be an excellent system and cheap too. Some of the lines reach areas that are 100 kms from the capital.
212,5.0,"Not only is the Seoul metro easy to navigate, it is also the cleanest cosmopolitan metro I have ever seen. Just know the names of the last stops to both directions on a metro line and you are set. All stations are also written and announced in English."
213,5.0,"Actually I dont know whether i would have managed without the apps i used, but with travel apps like citymapper or rome2rio its supper easy."
214,5.0,"We picked up a loadable card from our local shop (in our hotel!) and it was so cheap to travel, we only re-loaded once.You can even get your depost back on your card when you leave - we did that at the airport! Really great, clean, quite and frequent trains."
215,5.0,Really convenient. the only thing is to bring cash with you and to remember to get your card reimbursement at the end of the trip.
216,3.0,I rate the cleanliness punctuality and overall travelling experience the best I have experienced. It beats Singapore on these points very slightly and is streets ahead of London. I have not used Paris recently to be fair by that Metro. It fails on the fact that there is no one at the gates to assist which seemed reasonable weekends but surprising weekdays. Funny messages popped up on the ticketing screens about line choices and the “I” button got someone who has zero English skills gabbling at the other end. No one turned up. On the plus side Korean people from a 75+ Lady to a young chap were ever so helpful going out of their way to help. Another great feature is that the exits of stations are strategically positioned on the 4/5/6 points of the roads. Very helpful. In some stations linking with other attractions walking only underground thru the mini shopping malls is a help to one.
217,5.0,"Very convenient. Take the T Money card and use without paying cash at each usage. Very good and adequate information at all stations to commute easily. Reaches all major attractions and tourist spots in Seoul, even as further as two hours away on the outskirts."
218,5.0,"On time, modern, spacious trains, WiFi available at stations on most lines. Easy to use as everything is in also available in English"
219,5.0,The Metro system is easy to use and inexpensive. Great way to get around town and see the sights! Highly recommended!
220,5.0,"In June 2018 I visited Seoul, and South Korea has one of the cleanest and most well run public transit systems I have ever experienced. There are copious amounts of transit maps throughout all of the stations. Maps are in both Korean and English characters, and most additional signage and announcements are also in Japanese and Chinese. Important to note that these maps are NOT to scale, and when planning your route, remember that Namsan Park runs through the middle part of the city. If you do not have a Korean credit card, the cheapest way to ride the metro is to buy a T-money card at any local convenience store on to which you can load cash. The card costs 3,000 won (about $3 USD), but metro fare is cheaper when paying with a card than buying single rides. (I am not sure if there is an unlimited ride pricing option, but if you'll be using the metro quite a bit it could be a good idea to look into.)  Base fare is 1,200 won, and further trips cost more. To use the system, tap your card upon entering and remember to tap it again before leaving the system. That is how the total fare is calculated. Note that the metro systems and buses in other cities use the same payment method with the T-money card, and it was very convenient as we traveled south to Busan and across the country. (Note: You do not need to tap out of the buses.) Stations are very organized, and each exit has a different number, making it very easy to follow directions or meet up with folks. Each subway car is numbered, and specific seats are put aside for elderly, disabled or pregnant passengers. (This designation is taken seriously, and young people did not sit there.) A little song plays as the subway car approaches and also at each station where passengers can transfer to another line.  The subway connects to the KTX and AREX, so you can easily transfer to and from the airport and train and bus stations. Note that multiple lines have multiple different ending spots, and you may need to change tracks partway through ride. Locals and other visitors alike were very eager and willing to help if my partner and I looked confused in the station. Another plus: there are many restrooms in the metro stations (clean!), vending machines or snack vendor and sometimes even whole shopping areas. Note, there are almost NO public trashcans, so be prepared to carry your trash home with you. If you're visiting Seoul, if you want easy access to multiple metro lines, I highly recommend staying around the City and Jongno 3 stations."
221,5.0,Very convenient. Only minus is that it didn't run all day all night and it finishes around midnight. Its also very cheap!
222,5.0,"We have traveled the whole town with the subway - the only thing is that it was a bit too airconditioned, so on longer rides I was really freezing"
223,5.0,"Although the metro directions and map is a little complicated for a foreigner and a first time Seoul visitor,yet its the best way for transportation in Seoul metropolitan area.you shoul be very careful not to make mistakes about the routes and directions.getting tickets is easily done at departures by automatic machines by cash."
224,5.0,The train stations are convenient to use. Very fast and easy to use. Everything is in Korean or English so its not hard to navigate. Easy to buy cards and put money on it as well.
225,5.0,"Its clean, cheap and safe, so not like London or Paris. If you've travelled in Japan its very similar except for one point which affected us and that's a complete lack of station staff. I'd gone through an automated ticket barrier however my wife's ticket didn't work so I was one side (with the money) she was on the other, a passing man did try to help but to no avail. Just as I was about go out and buy another pair of tickets a disabled man went through a swing gate and my wife snuck through with him. However when we arrived at our final destination she could not get out but we did find a fare adjustment machine which recognised where we had brought the ticket and that it was not validated, but it validated the ticket so she could get out."
226,5.0,"Easy to follow subway map. Lots of English around so you can get by without knowing any korean. We used a subway app (Korea subway) to journey plan and it was pretty easy. So cheap as well to use. 1250 won for one way. Adds a bit extra if you transfer to a station that's further away but not much, few hundred up to 1000 if you go really far like to Everland.Frequent trains too so no waiting around. The longest we waited was for the Everline ( to Everland) because it was every 30mins a train and only one carriage because not many people use it. Still can get a seat even though only one carriage train!"
227,5.0,Used the metro extensively while in Seoul and it was super reliable. always on time and never too crowded as a new train comes every 5 minutes. The signage in the stations are easy to understand as a foreigner.
228,5.0,"In Korea, T Money card is used as the transportation card. It can be easily topped up at the machine at each station. The metro station in Korea is very convenient to travel to most places."
229,2.0,"We were there for my birthday trip in May. The metro lines are comprehensive but not user-friendly when it comes to exiting the area. Most of the stations doesn't have escalators or lifts to the ground level. You have to be literally climbing stairs after stairs after stairs (most of them starts from basement 5)..... most stations are clean but outdated in terms of structure, looks and stench with urine-smell and from rubbish bins and etc. My operated-knee was suffering after the 2nd day."
230,5.0,"If you like to visit several places, you can buy a stored value ticket and use the metro to travel around. The stations are conveniently located. The trains are punctual and well maintained. The route is easy to find - there are English & Korean words. Announcements on board the train also have English language.  The main considerations are steps and walking. There are a lot of stairs and escalators (or you have to look for the elevators).  When you change train, you may have to walk quite a bit to the next line. Of course, this provides a healthy exercise. Besides, there are underground shops in and around the stations."
231,4.0,There were confusing at first coz of many lines that interconnecting each other but after you familiar with it then it gets easy to get around. Metro are not so busy but waiting time sometimes quite long like 5 minutes. But it gets you where you want to go
232,4.0,"Its convenient, clean, affordable and safe. Only thing is the STAIRS!!! About 80% of stations do not have elevators. Lifts are mainly only for the needy and you get judged if you take the lift. We had such a hard time with our huge luggages. If you get off the wrong stop, transferring and finding the right platform can be quite complicated especially for tourists. Also, stations are often huge, so allocate ample time for your travel."
233,5.0,"The first day we traveled by the metro, we discovered that the elderly, even foreigners, can use it for free. In the payment machine, there is an option ""Complementary"" for the elderly. It requires a password. Tell the station attendant that you are 65. He will type in the password and you have to pay 500 won for one trip (about $0.5). On the way out of the metro, you insert you card in another machine and get back your 500 won."
234,5.0,From the Incheon airport you can take express train to Seoul main station than from here you can take Metro every in the city very convenient and fast and very clean and safe too
235,5.0,"its pretty on time, just that if you are disabled? prepare to hunt for elevators, they are usually hidden"
236,5.0,Absolutely great transit system. It goes everywhere in the city and suburbs. It is easy to use and English friendly. The stops are clearly indicated and announced in advance. The stations are clean and very easy to navigate. The connections are easy to find and get to. The base fare is 1250KRW and any surcharge is charged when you scan your card to exit your destination-station.
237,5.0,"One of the better metro systems I’ve used around the world. Although their metro is huge, it’s fairly easy for English speakers to navigate. Seemed like you could wander the city in any direction for ten minutes and you would find a station entry."
238,5.0,"Clean, efficient, and cheap. Takes you anywhere and everywhere you want to go. Unless you want to take the bus so you can look out the window, it's the best way to get around Seoul.Tip: download the app for your phone. It works very well.Note: The metro can get crazy crowded. You may get bumped. Do not sit in the pink seat unless you are a pregnant woman. Avoid the handicapped/elderly seats or be prepared to give it up to someone."
239,5.0,"During our 5 days stay in Seoul we used the metro every day as it is the fastest and most convenient way to travel in Seoul (beside of walking). The ticket machines only accept cash and no cards, so always keep some coins with you. After using the ticket and leaving the station you find some refund machines where you get a refund for the metro card."
240,4.0,"We travelled via the subway in Seoul we used our t money card and it is efficient, clean and cheap way to travel . Although if you have luggage it has many stairs?"
241,5.0,"The metro in Seoel transport you throughout the city.However it takes time to to feel comfortabel. You can buy daycards as foreigner. Also you can buy cards for single trio’s. The tarif starts from 1200 won.You will get a card for the trip wich cost 500 won.Afterwards you put the card in a machine and you get the 500 won back.A daycard cost 10.000 won.The distantie to visit some arena is great, so take the metro"
242,4.0,"Trains are very clean and covers a very wide area.  Stations are easy to access.  Changing train lines can be an experience as it may be a 5 minute walk from one platform to the next.  However, the lines and direction are clearly marked in English and easy to follow.  Frequecy is about every 5 minutes. If you are in Seoul for more than 3 days and plan to use the trains, it is well worth buying the T-Money travel card. Very convenient.  Overall, the trains were excellent and very cheap."
243,4.0,"We bought our passes from 7/11 that had cute Line Friends characters on it. Easy to take however some connecting stations are a bit of a walk to transfer. The subways are not as efficient as other South East Asia, but coming from Sydney's railway system , I can't complain. Easily can reload and return at any station. Most trips cost about 1500won return"
244,5.0,We took the Metro from the airport to city centre and back and forth. It was a perfect transportation option for us - very easy and convenient. I can recommend.
245,4.0,"Convenient that there is a station almost every major block in the city. The line numbers and station numbers help to know where you are even if you don't know Hungul; however, the locals don't know or use the station numbers so sometime it was tricky to get on the same page when asking which station to use."
246,5.0,"After buying a travel card and loading it for the time we were in Seoul, we had easy and reasonably priced way to get around the city. The Stations are clean and well signed which included English. Trains are clean but can be crowded. f you are elderly do not expect the youth to provide you a seat even if they are in delegated seating for elderly. My only negative. Strongly recommend this for city travel."
247,4.0,The subway is much faster than the buses especially for long distances.  But be prepared for a lot of stairs if you transfer.  We had trouble with directions as not all stations have English maps available and our cellphone wasn't always get the greatest signals to help us.
248,5.0,"We took the Metro from Gimpo to our hotel.   So clean, cheap and easy.   One transfer.   No problem.   Get the T card and load some money on to it.    Makes it a little cheaper and much faster to go thru.    You can get a refund on any unspent money on the card.  I wish our Chicago El (Metro) was half as nice!"
249,3.0,It is very hard to find elevators in the metro. Not recommended for travelers who have a lot and heavy luggages to use this transportation to get into the city
250,5.0,We highly recommend getting passes as it works out much cheaper than cash. If you don't then remember to recycle your card in the machines which pay you your 500won deposit back. Also the lines all connect somewhere and it's so much better than a bus especially because in our situation buses were taking significantly longer times then stipulated by Google maps. This is a foreign mans saviour if you're a tourist in korea and it's extremely easy to use.
251,5.0,"The only way to zip around the city and save your feet. Clean trains, regular service and good value at W1250 for most city trips, W1350 for Gangnam area. Stick with the single use tickets if you are in the city for only a few days. The fare is only W100 extra and you can get the W500 card deposit back at the end of the journey easily when you locate the deposit machine! The T card saves some hassle as you can load it up and saves you buying tickets and getting deposits back, but at W3000 for the card (non-refundable we found out later!), you need a lot of trips to get value out of it and the discounts you get with the card are minimal now."
252,5.0,"The Seoul subway system is clean, cheap, reliable, safe, and easy to use. Be sure to download and use their app for an easy way to get around town."
253,4.0,"The metro gives terrific coverage of Seoul and the surrounding areas, with frequent trains.  Very clean cars and stations, but in bad need of many more escalators/elevators."
254,5.0,"I've been to and ridden subways in London, Paris, Rome, Athens, Amsterdam, New York, DC, Boston, LA, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok and others and I've never ridden a cleaner, more compehensive, more efficient or easy metro system.The arrows and signage could be a little clearer, but it's a piece of cake!"
255,4.0,We used the Metro a lot and found it easy to follow and not that difficult to pay. We just showed the brochure of where we were going to and the bus driver told us how much.
256,5.0,I jsut used it twice but it was really on time and easy access to all lines from the main station. It was on time and easy access
257,5.0,"As a New Yorker, I have HUGE subway-envy! Can the people that run this metro please move to New York City and transform our horrible transit system? Please?? This metro is easy to use and SO CLEAN!! The trains are clean, the stations are clean and yes, the bathrooms are clean!! Clean bathrooms at every station! Seriously the best transit system I have ever seen."
258,5.0,Seoul's metro system is probably one of the best of its kind. There is literally no place in this metropolis that you can't reach by subway. Although sometimes you must expect to travel hours on it :)
259,5.0,Used it whilst in Seoul just like metro in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In English and easy to navigate. If you're used to any metro this one should be no problem. If you buy single ticket you have to pay a small deposit which you get back a the end of the journey by returning the ticket to one of the designated machines
260,5.0,"We tried to learn the alphabet in order to read signs and make travel easy, but all of the signs were translated, as were the maps.  Grateful for the extra efforts they put in to make everything easily navigable."
261,4.0,"The subway system is quite expansive and large - for first time visitors, it appears overwhelming as there's so many stations in the network but once you understand the colour coding of the lines, it's quite easy to navigate around.Ticket machines have an English option, so grab yourself a network map and find the station you need to access and away you go."
262,4.0,The Seoul metro is a fine example of modern transport English is available at the ticket machines and the colour coding for lines and exits works wellPlenty of in station maps to guide you
263,4.0,"The subway system is very large, with fairly close metro stations.  It has a sliding glass-like partition separating the public from the moving train, which opens when the train stops, making it safer.  The metro is very clean, due to a well-run metro operation and a very conscientious Korean people.  As a tourist, I was challenged with the complexity of the exits; as some metro stations had up to 12 to 14 different exits.  When visiting, know what station you want to go through, but also what exit is best for where you are going.  Most attractions will state the best station and exit on their website.  Wherever we went, the metro (and streets in Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean.  It is true that everyone on the Metro was completely focused on their cell phone; hardly anyone spoke to each other."
264,5.0,"A combination of comport and frequency, Seoul's metro is a great means of transportation. Even though, when you pay single tickets, you always have to redeem the price of the actual ticket (the card itself) - which is an annoying action. Other than that, its a great way to explore the city."
265,5.0,"Easy to use and easy to navigate, just download the app of the Korean subway to even make it more easier to use."
266,5.0,The Seoul Metro subway is one of the best and cleanest I have ever been on. It can take you all over Seoul and beyond. It is not the cheapest but not terribly expensive either.  Riders line up accordingly and have seats for elderly as well.You can buy a TMoney card and load it up with funds at any subway or metro station. The announcements are generally in Korean and English unless out of the metro area. The TMoney card also works on buses.
267,5.0,"Clean, modern, friendly subway system I've ever encountered! We are from England and London underground can be dangerous and dirty. My wife said if London underground is this clean and safe, she would use it more often."
268,5.0,"Being a regular user of the London Underground when visiting  UK as well as experiencing the N.Y. subway and several in European cities I can honestly say the Seoul Metro tops them all. Lines from both airports and to all corners of the city. Modern, clean, fast and safe with platform safety doors at every station I went to. Easy to use system with clear signage and on board announcements in English as well as Korean. Make sure you get a T Money card either at the ticket booth or convenience store for 2500 Won and then load it at the machine by the turnstiles. Instructions on the machine are available in several languages including English. Basic ride costs 1250 Won with the card and after the first 10km there is a small additional charge per km based on distance. No charge for transfer between lines or to/from buses. From Gangnam to Incheon Airport was about 4500 Won. A bargain! The trains are frequent and often very busy but everyone is polite. Stations all have maps of the immediate area to help you find the right exit. I highly recommend using the Metro to get around Seoul."
269,5.0,"A great way to get around Seoul. The ticket machines in the stations have an English option, and are easy and intuitive to use.  We bought T money cards (like a London Underground Oyster card) and this made our travels around Seoul even easier (and allowed us to use the bus and the AREX to the airport). Signposting is clear, with everything in English as well as Korean, and the stations and trains are spotless. I’ve used subway systems all over the world, and this is one of the easiest to use and navigate your way around."
270,5.0,"It’s cheap, eliable, frequent and it covers the whole of Seoul. What’s not to like. Brilliant metro service."
271,5.0,"the MEtro is amazing. It's Convenient, Fast, on time, reliable, goes everywhere and cheap. All stations are marked in English and within the trains each station is announced in English so its truly easy to find your way. WIthin the stations you can find small shops for food and other small items."
272,5.0,Moving one area to another will be conducive to take subway for efficiency of mobility.. No rush for parking lot.. No worries on petrol run in the tank.. And efficiency of meeting guess or clients around metropolitan Seoul. Top up your T Money for uninterrupted mobility at the station.
273,4.0,Super easy way to get anywhere in Seoul. Just avoid rush-hour (0800-0930) and (1630-1900) if you can - or you will be crammed in like a sardine.  Most subway map signs in Korean and English.
274,5.0,The metro have easy Access the metro have tooo many shops to buy stuff and it can reach you any where u like the ticket start from 2000 to 6000
275,5.0,"Best way to get around Seoul.  The trains run every two to three minutes, rides are inexpensive and the metro will get you just about anywhere in Seoul you'd want to go."
276,4.0,"Very like the Metro in Tokyo, London, New York, etc. Efficient, crowded at rush hour, but people stopped to help us find our way if we looked lost."
277,4.0,"You can get to pretty much anywhere in Seoul via their metro and some of the lines even go as far as the next town. All announcements are in Korean, English, and Chinese. The TVs in the carriages also show the upcoming stations.Be aware that some of the transfer between lines can be very long and not all exits have lifts if you don't want to be climbing the stairs. Highly recommend purchasing a T-money card for easy travel especially if you're in Seoul for many days. It's easy to top up at any of the machines and easy to use as well. A nice keepsake item to take home with you afterwards. I also recommend downloading the free app called Kakao Metro. It will show you how to get from station a to station b. Much easier than trying to work it all out from their enormous map."
278,5.0,"Incredibly good experience for a Westerner! For example, heated seats in the morning. Yes, you read that correctly."
279,5.0,"I love the metro! I have been in South Korea for 6months for work and I took the metro on my first day in the country with no clue of where/how I was going anywhere. The app is amazing! Kakao metro is one of the most useful apps ever. You plug in your starting point and desitnation. It gives you so much information, even down to the best train to ride in for an easy exit/transfer. The subway is insanely clean and always on time. There are special seats for the elderly, disabled, pregnant, etc. There are bathrooms in each station and they are also clean. I am super impressed with the metro system in Seoul!"
280,4.0,"Seoul is the Capital City of South Korea, and it's where my fiancé and I went for our honeymoon.Seoul Metro is convenient and clean, and unlike the Taipei MRT, they actually sell food inside the Subway System.I loved it, and even though it was complicated beyond my comprehension, I still enjoyed riding the Seoul Metro System.卍 Name Amidhaba Buddha 卍"
281,5.0,"I love Korean metro. Looks complicated in the beginning but after a while, I think it's the best metro I ever used."
282,5.0,first there are total of 19 lines connecting to different parts of seoul.2nd is the efficiency..but there are too many exits and one must be very clear which to go..main concern is the numerous stairs of steps.hard to find lift in every subway.the govt should spare a thought for the elderly and foreigners who come from countries which have very good transport system.do not force them to walk and climb so much.at my age of 50 i have problem climbing and for my hubby who has asthma too.
283,4.0,"Seoul’s subway is one of the best I have used in the world. It covers the whole city and is both very efficient and super easy to use with all signage, ticket machines and announcements in English. The maps of subway station exits is a must have to know where to go or give as a meeting point to people. Awesome experience!"
284,5.0,"The Seoul Metro was easy to use and changes were no problem. Well sign posted and a fast and easy way to get around.  The trains at times are very crowded, but everyone is respectful and you always seem to get on.  It is incredibly clean and always felt safe."
285,5.0,So easy to use to get around. Many tourist sites give information about the nearest subway station on their website. Announcements and signs are in English (sometimes Mandarin and Japanese too). Get a t-money transport card for extra easy use but the ticket machines also have English. Important to note that ticket machines and t-money card top up machines only accept cash.
286,5.0,"The Seoul Metro is fantastic. It’s cheap, easy to navigate and very efficient. You can pretty much get anywhere you would like to. Don’t bother using the overpriced cabs just use the metro."
287,4.0,"Download Naver and away you go. Cheap and efficient as well as easy to navigate, the quickest and best way to get around Seoul.The absence of many escalators/lifts did make travelling with luggage a bit tricky at times though as there are a lot of stairs."
288,5.0,The Seoul Metro seems complicated but once you study it a bit the apprehension calms.  It is easy to get to any destination
289,4.0,"The metro system in Seoul is quite extensive, but there are so many exits and different ways to get on to the platforms that it is easy to take a wrong turn if you’re not a local."
290,5.0,"Fast, clean and easy to use. One of the best public transport systems in the world. Beat the traffic and use the trains when visiting Seoul."
291,4.0,Easy to use and the maps are clear.  Easy to move around the city using  the metro.  Like metros in other countries but much cleaner in the stations and on the trains.
292,5.0,"Always efficient, very clean and it is so cheap to use. Many stations which makes crossing Seoul and Neighbouring areas a breeze."
293,5.0,"Great subway system. Unfortunately there is no staff to help you with buying your tickets. Also at the station you can only buy single ride tickets. Subway cards are not sold at stations.
