0,4.0,A nice area to buy a lot of clothing for your wife or girlfriend. A lot of different street food. Overall I spent about five hours there and the street food are fairly priced!
1,4.0,I would suggest to tourist to come here for shopping. You can get everything at reasonable price (Korea costly than China). Make sure you do some negotiation here. This complex is open for late night. Also if you need branded things than Lotte store is just beside this complex.
2,5.0,This whole area is full with shopping malls that open until 3am. I must place for those who wants to shop. You can get local products as well all new k-pop style fashion.
