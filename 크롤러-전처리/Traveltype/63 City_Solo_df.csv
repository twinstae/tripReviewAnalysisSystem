0,3.0,Took a 10-15 mins walk from the Yeoinaru station. First went to the aquarium but the place as smaller than expected. I would say not worth the price if you are not interested in sea creatures. The observatory and art museum was worth the time there as it overlooks the whole of S.Korea.Tip: I left 63 city around 7 and walked past the Han river towards Yeoinaru station and there was a great view there since there was a great sunset.
1,3.0,"63 Square is one of the tallest buildings in Seoul. It is also a cultural complex. It has 63 Art observatory, museum, and Aqua Planet. The night view of Seoul from 63 Art, the highest gallery in the world is outstanding!!63 Art Galleria.... 13,000 won. Aqua Planet 23,000 won. Since 90% of the museum in Seoul are FREE and minimal admission fee for the palace. For the galleria and aquarium... 13,000 won and 23, 000 won is a little bit pricey. Subway Line 5, Yeouinaru Station, Exit 4"
2,3.0,Nothing really special at 63 City. There is a Duty Free Shop there where tourists were brought there by tourist buses.
3,3.0,"I visited 63 building only outside...în the park, so i can not Tell so much about this spot. It was the tallest building în Asia în 1985"
4,4.0,"I always have a soft spot for observation decks and 63 Building's was no exception. Admission was ₩13,000 and it is best to go up in the evening and on a clear day the views will be magnificent. The glass elevator was fun to be in, even though it only lasts for a minute or so."
5,4.0,"Stunning view of the city. It was a nice afternoon spent visiting attractions and browsing the other shops. Eric Kayser bakery is excellent, I particularly liked the green tea cakes."
6,4.0,"So I've been wanting to see this building in person since I played Sim City when I was a kid.  I'm so happy I finally saw it.  After having lunch at a little bbq joint in Yeouido, I decided to walk to this building.  It was pretty far, it took me about 40 minutes to get here.  Maybe I'm just slow at walking.  But it was well worth it.A lot of stuff inside.  They even have a museum at the top floor.  The stuff in the museum is just ok for me.  I paid for the amazing views not the artwork to be honest.  It was well worth the visit."
7,5.0,I visited the 63 Hanwha building because it is such a beautiful structure on the banks of the Hangang. I was looking for place to eat and found Viaggio63. I received some of the most elegant service here. Impeccably dressed women provided perfect service so I hesitate to call them waitresses. I can recommend the Salmon Salad pizza which is smoked salmon and salad on a cooked pizza. Very tasty indeed
8,4.0,"I only went here to get up to the observation level on the top floor and it's well worth it - I was fortunate it was a bright, clear day so the views along the river and over the city were very good and you get a good appreciation of the layout of Seoul and the observation deck was well maintained and the windows clear.  The art exhibition that's also up there seems a bit of an afterthought.  I got there at 10am on a sunday morning and had the place to myself with no queues to buy tickets or travel up in the lift.  It's not the easiest place to get to via the underground - about a 15 min walk from the nearest station."
9,4.0,"The 63 building is a rather well-designed building on Yeouido island. The gold exterior is radiant during sunny days, and the structure is now a familiar locale on the Han river. As far as modern skyscapers, the 63 building does not stand out for its height, at least internationally. Visitors can either enjoy the building from the river, as river cruises are widely available in Seoul. Or visitors that are generally more interested in skyscapers and ""view points"" can travel to Yeouido, and see the 63 building up close. There is a pleasant (small) sculpure garden on the ground level. The fee to see views are a bit expensive, but on clear days, the view is nice. Keep in mind that while the view is enjoyable, it cannot be compared to Hong Kong or New York."
