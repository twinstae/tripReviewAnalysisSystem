1,5.0,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️The place actually made me feel Happy! Made me feel peaceful , thankful and filled with emotions. Guess it is easily confused with Yeouido Park or Hangang Park. Look for Conrad hotel and youll know this is the one.The pictures I’ve seen here do not make justice.You have families and young couples or friends relaxing over the day with their tents , you have young talented singers doing an amazing job. The sunset really changes the vibe and best to observe it is while riding a bike around the place"
2,5.0,"Great place to skateboard, and play with your child and family. It's a bit windy when we came, but people said that it's so good at summer. There are many bikes which are available for rent, so we got one for us to get around of the park, great experience. We also called some foods and ate in here."
3,4.0,"One of must visits in the time of cherry blossom in Seoul April... along the street of Yeouido, and the whole view of city along Hangang river... take time to picture...time to visit: 12th apr..."
4,5.0,Yeouido Hangang Park has so much to offer. Every park has a unique side. Better to roam around just to see its unique beauty. :)
5,5.0,"My cousin and I visited this park on a random day.  We didn't have anything planned in our itinerary so we walked around and saw a bike share, so we rented bikes and rode along the trails at this park.  It was so beautiful!  The weather was perfect that day and the scenery was perfect for some wonderful photos. If you want to have a relaxed day along the river, I recommend this park for lounging, for picnic day or for biking."
6,5.0,"Very nice place to spend time with friends and family. We came on an afternoon, and people has already started their picnic.. it's even more merry in the evening as more people come. Bring your picnic mat or even rent the tents here! Pack your own food or skip the hassle by having one of the food delivery services offered. Cycling rental is available, clean and well maintained toilets. It's also interesting to just sit down and observe the people while overlooking the famous Han river. This place is definitely a venue to visit for a lovely korean-style picnic !"
7,5.0,definitely worth your while to make a trip here.very interesting experience to be able to call for fried chicken and get it delivered to you.Enjoyed the peace and serenity here
8,5.0,Is there a better place to go when it’s cherry blossom season? You can get a picnic out and drink some soju with friends. Pack a blanket though in case you get chilly.
9,4.0,"great place for a slow walk, strolling, jogging or cycling and picnic when the weather is more breezing. perfect place at 63 building for adults and children for there's aquarium, shops & restaurants, top floor to explore."
10,4.0,"Spent a couple of days along the River Han and one of the days At Yeouido Hangang Park. Hired a bike for a couple of hours for only $5. Easy ride heading towards the sea, but some short/steep hills back towards Seoul. Not many activities but pleasant place to spend some time."
11,4.0,"On the weekends, this place is full of families with children of all ages. And there are a lot of bikers, so watch out for them.  All in all it is a nice place to relax, take a walk or just hang out with your friends over a beer."
12,4.0,"Had a picnic here with friends and people around sell picnic mats / tents so buy them if you do not have any. While we didn't see many shelters, the park is really big and we only covered a little section of it. Not many shelters but you can do the river cruise or cycle down the park to see more of it quicker. Come here if you are running out of sights to see in Seoul but want to get a great view of the Hangang River"
13,4.0,"Finally set my feet on the famous Han River in my 2nd visit to Seoul. It was very crowded and cold when we were there. It was evening time and it was super crowded with lots of locals setting tents on the big patches of grass for picnics. There were food trucks along the way selling all kinds of goodies with none of the trucks that were without long queues. There were also performances by youngsters with audiences cheering for them along the river walk. There were also night market at the further end of the park where the crowd were even more packed. The night market stalls were selling handicraft items, from handmade soaps, pets accessories, jewelries, artwork, etc. A nice experience to be sitting on the walkway by the river admiring the night scenery with pleasant singing by the youngsters. The temperature dropped further when the night fall. So, if you want to visit the park during Spring, Autumn or Winter, remember to wear or bring along jackets to keep warm."
14,4.0,"The most popular activity to do when visiting the park is to go tandem biking. This is an activity made popular through numerous K dramas. However, it was not so easy for me and my friend- mostly because tandem biking requires synchronization between cyclists and we obviously were not in sync. However, we then requested to switch to the normal bikes and the bike rental place was extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to change (its KRW3000 p/h). The park is also always full on the weekend, with the locals pitching tents and laying out mats early in the evening to wait for the sunset. You can also take a cruise on the Han river for roughly KRW20,000. Overall, visiting the park is definitely worthwhile as it is free and you can enjoy a break from the busy city, take beautiful pictures and enjoy the company of your party or just relax by yourself."
15,3.0,"There are several places, which are higher, that is why the attracting point is broken. Back in the days that was nice to visit this building, but now, when there is Lotter Tower in the city, sorry... Though the area around building is nice:)"
16,4.0,"I visit here often. It's quite, spacious, with some great views of the 63 building. Just take a blanket and some food and have a great picnic. It's beautiful when the cherry blossoms bloom. It can become very crowded at that time."
17,5.0,"Stop at Yeouinaru and take exit 2.Many couples were around for pinics (they have many pushcart stalls that sell picnic mats for 2,000-5,000 Won each).I went in sept and during the day it was a nice cool breezy 22 degrees.Many people were jogging or cycling along the river and the designated tracks.A must visit if you don't want to spend money but want a beautiful day out."
18,5.0,"If you have some extra time, come here for an evening picnic by the riverside! Order from the delivery (if you know how to order in Korean or have a Korean friend with you) but if you don't, fear not! Plenty of stalls along the way where you can pick up your food and drinks and picnic mats to rent for you to enjoy the view of Hangang."
19,4.0,"The park is filled with street food trucks and people pitching up their tents enjoying the great outdoors. There are various water features further down and a few stages for street performances from budding student artists or even professionally debuted groups if you're lucky. The paths are also great for cycling, and you can rent bikes or tandems on site."
20,4.0,Seoul is blessed with beautiful landscape and you can see it from here. The best time to visit is in Spring. Enjoy picnic in the park with rented mat or you can also buy one for a very affordable price.
21,5.0,"I visited this place at morning and the weather was really nice and refreshing. The  place is also spacey, have a good air and view. You can walk along in the side of han river or you can rent a bike and enjoy going around the han river. It's a nice place to visit."
22,4.0,A really beautiful park with cherry blossoms. My friends and I once rented bikes here too which was great fun. A lot of locals also venture out to the park to spend the day here which was really nice to get amongst. A lovely park to stroll through.
23,4.0,I have been here once only - a nice place to visit in the early April. The park and the street is lined up with hundreds or thousands of cherry blossom trees. It is beautiful to stroll along the scented street or rest in the park. The upside of it is that it is really popular with the locals; so be prepared to be in the midst of thousands of people (during the Cherry blossom festival). I imagine the Park and the street with trees looking beautiful in the fall as well.
24,4.0,The park is quite big and is lovely to take a morning stroll in. Also caught some cherry blossoms there so it was really pretty. Great for picnics too as the grass is nicely trimmed.
25,5.0,I really love the 64 building because it was so beautiful in the picture. It was a good place for picnic beside the Han river.
26,5.0,"Surrounded by busy environment, Yeouido Park is a choice to visit (for doing sport, friends gathering or chilling around).The atmosphere is perfect to refill more energy before going back to hectic life"
27,5.0,"I loved roaming this park on foot and via bike. The sights—filled with natural beauties—are so pleasing to the eyes and calming to the soul. I capped off my first time in Seoul here, and the bike ride along Han River made me cry just cause I was so thrilled to be there hahahaha :D"
28,5.0,"The Yeouido Hangang Park offers great views and is a good place for a picnic, jogging or cycling. You can also take great pictures and enjoy the river breeze. It is also very accessible via metro (alight at Yeouinaru station, Seoul Subway Line 5)"
29,5.0,"One of my favorite places I've visited during our stay in Seoul. A lot of Koreans relax here, mostly families and young couples. Although it can get really crowded, it's still a nice and chill atmosphere, especially during sunset."
30,5.0,"After our early dinner together with my two Korean friend, they brought us to Hangang Park. And we saw a lot of people i.e. from dating to friends to families that gathered in this place they esp. during summer. Our host even told us that families build tents and slept over the night, it's how safe the place is. It's a huge park right beside the longest Han River. There's a lot of things you can do like jogging, biking or just to simply chatting with your friends. You can go there by taking off from Yeouinaru subway station.  :)"
31,5.0,this place is super nice for spending some time outdoor with friends. you can go biking for 3000w/hour and enjoy some food sitting in the grass.
32,5.0,"things to do here :1- rent a bike and enjoy bike ride.2- buy river ferry ticket (the round trip last for an hour and circle back again to the place of departure)3- bring your picnic stuff and enjoy the grass and the good view (many Koreans bring small tents with them) also you can order chicken or pizza and it will be delivered to you near the metro station or on the street (some Korean language is needed)4- visit 63 building (the golden building) there are an aquarium , wax Museum and an observatory"
33,5.0,"Great place to just chill be the river.  We went to just have a snack and soju by the river but ended up renting bikes, a tandem and single coat for an hr was 9,000 won. About $8 US.  Bikes were in good shape unlike some I've rented in different places.  Super chill to ride along the river on wide sidewalks.  There are bathrooms here and there and small convenience stores for whatever ya need.  Some bring tents and hang out for hours and others just pass through.  It's clean safe outdoors and would definitely recommend if you're looking to get outside and kill some time in Seoul!"
34,5.0,"went there, hoping to see some cherry blossoms, but there werent any when we went there as the season had just ended. still pretty awesome to see how the Koreans actually spend their weekends there, camping and hanging out with their loved ones. we saw some filming going on too. there's food and street performers too."
35,5.0,"This park is huge and beautiful. I have been here on different occasions during different seasons with different people. One thing for sure, we have always enjoyed our trip there. I always have my annual winter vsit to this park just to give myself a short break fro the crazy schedule. It is always quite empty during winter so it feels like I have the park to myself. Watching the sunset while having a cup of coffee in a cafe which faces the river is perfect. During fall and spring, picnic is something not uncommon especially among locals. Go for a bike ride or just sit down and enjoy your time with family and friends. Either way it will be a fun day for you. I always avoid going to the cherry blossom festivals because it will be too packed with people. Instead I would suggest going several days earlier or well a day or two earlier would be fine too as most trees will be blooming by then and it won't be as pack as during the festival period. Sometimes, there are also performances at the main park area. So just sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery and time with your loved ones."
36,4.0,peaceful experience. You get to feel the Fresh air with the smell of a river (literally it smells like raining). a good place to think about yourself. Make sure to checkout fireworks festival in fall/autumn season
37,5.0,Its just a big open space off the side of the road but at least it is quiet and the grass is nice and on a summer day great place to draw or read with an umbrella
38,5.0,I love going there whenever I visit Seoul. The best relaxing place in Seoul and you can ride bicycle there.
39,4.0,"I wanted to see the Hangang River, and Yeouido offers spectacular view of the river. Even though the traffic is busy, we can watch the traffic pass by without hearing it. Nice place to relax and stroll."
40,5.0,"South Korea very understanding what people want. There's so many park, beautiful park. Better if you ride a bicycle here.. Actually if you want to go to this place, please be relax, don't just sight seeing. ENJOY it.."
41,5.0,"I was lucky enough to visit Yeouido to meet a friend who works for Hyundai and it was such a beautiful area. It was also a little bit of a shock for me as I visited Yeouido which is mostly business people, politicians and police before going to Itaewon which is the foreign district. I didn't see any other foreigner whilst I was in Yeouido and I think several people were surprised to see me there.Yeouido itself has many tall buildings with lots of glass fronting. The style of the buildings is very western and far away from traditional korean architecture. There's also the parliament building there with many protests happening on a daily basis. I saw at least 4 police coaches whilst I was there and as I passed they were deploying towards the protests. The park is absolutely beautiful and much needed there. It was thriving with people taking part in some sort of game show, as well as office workers and elderly people getting excercise.There's a large soft track that spands the outskirt of the park and several toilet facilities. In the centre of the park there's an astro-turf/basketball area with plane statue. There's also a nature reserve with a small stream and wooden paths you can walk along so you don't distrurb the animals. I only saw many plants and some birds but it was so quiet and serene. I was surprised that they'd made wheelchair access to the paths with areas along the path to move a wheelchair into should the user need a rest."
42,5.0,We took a stroll through the park and it was very relaxing. There was plenty of space with people enjoying different activities from cycling to exercising. I wish we had parks like these in the United States
43,4.0,"regardless it's day time or night time, Koreans love to chill by the Hangang! It was comfortable and plenty of space to sit and relax, talk or even picnic. It's beautiful but you can try to search if there are any activities in the area otherwise it can be a little boring."
44,4.0,"There's not much to see in Yeouido Hangang Park itself; it's the view of Yeouido Tower and above all of the Han River that makes a visit to the park worthwhile; that, and the Han River cruise that you can embark on from the edge of the park. On a sunny summer evening, this could be the perfect place for a little picnic, if it's not too hot and humid (as is all too often the case in Seoul). The only tricky thing is transportation, as you have to take a bus or a taxicab to and from the park, since there is no nearby subway station."
45,5.0,"Yeouido Hangang Park is just like Battery Park in New York. It is close to the central business district (Yeouido has its own Wall Street nearby) and it has: nice breezes, green grass, perfect sunset, and lots of photo-ops!"
46,5.0,"The park goes all the way around the island.  I live in another part of the city, but I sometimes take a bus to Yeouido just to go for a walk here.  There are places along the way where the greenery closes above you.  The views across the water are also great."
47,4.0,"Greeted by flyers of fried chicken once we came out from the Yeouido subway station. But the fried chickens had to be order through phone calls and we couldnt speak Korean. Luckily there was a Korean guy offered help to call, but we had to wait for 40 minutes for the delivery. (Alright I shall stop the Fried chicken story)We took the cruise at 9pm, 9600 won after discount, and it took about 30 minutes, where you could enjoy night scenery along the Han river, had a close look at the bridges beneath them. Enjoyed the night cruise. It's a soothing one. There might have little concerts and people would throw their support there. Quite a happening park but does not lose its serenity. Can ride a bike or do picnics there, just like the locals do! A wonderful place for picnic yeah!"
48,3.0,"It was a normal park in the middle of the city area, but maybe a good place to view cherry blossom in full bloom"
49,4.0,This place is great for having a picnic and it's conveniently located near the IFC Mall! You can ride your bike along the bike paths or play basketball as well! The plants and flowers are well taken care of too.
50,4.0,"The entire Yeouido Park area is just a great place to rest, relax and meditate.  It is in the shape of a T.  Yeouido Park is the stem of the T, and the Hangam Park area runs along the water.  Lots of native trees, grass and plants and flowers.  Walking, biking trails, benches and tranquil view of the Han River.  Take the metro, line 5, purple and when you exit the park is right in front of you.  Hopefully if you are visiting and have the time between sightseeing and shopping, this is a great respite from the hectic Seoul."
51,4.0,"If you want somewhere pleasant and outdoors to hang out for a picnic in Seoul, this is a great place, particularly in the humid summer, when you'll appreciate the open space and the chance of a breeze. The Han is an impressively wide river, and is framed by the skyscrapers of Yeouido. There's a wide grassy area between the street and the river, so plenty of space to throw down a blanket, pop an bottle of wine, and chill out in the sun. Hangang park extends for miles in each direction, and is pretty much one giant cycle path, so if you have a bike, this is a great place to get exercise in peace and safety, without having to tackle the potential nightmare of cycling on the roads of central Seoul."
52,5.0,Riding along the Han is one of my favourite things to do in Korea. Rent a bike and go exploring. Order some pizza or chicken and have it delivered to you at the park while you watch the water display at Banpo Bridge or a show on the floating stage.
53,5.0,Has been knowing this park from Running Man and wanting to come here for a look. Luckily the time of my visit was during spring. Slightly sunny day and windy. Should have bring some snacks along to have a mini picnic with my deary friend. This park is ideal for outdoor activities. Saw some people setting up tent on the park. How I wish I can do that too!!! like overnight in the middle of the park and the weather/environment is chilling. cooool~
54,5.0,visited the park during the early part of the cherry blossom season and was lucky to see the beginnings of the blooming! grab a chicken and beer leaflet from one of the ajummas hanging around the subway station exits and order some fried chicken to munch on while relaxing by the riverside!
55,5.0,"We are so fortunate that the cherry flowers waited for us :) The pretty numerous flowers from the strip of many cherry blossoms trees welcome us, telling us enjoy and take a lot of pictures until you can :) The lights which added shimmer to the cherry flowers made it more magnificent and captivating."
56,5.0,Went here to catch the cherry blossoms and it definitely did not disappoint. A good place to spend the afternoon by the Hangang River. Yeouinaru Station on Line 5 Exit 1.
57,4.0,"It's very peaceful park. Super big that your legs get tired walking around. There is bicycle for rent (I think it's for rent, didn't go to ask for the fee and condition). The han river is very nice, it's quite chill and windy, so make sure you wear long-sleeve shirts or sweater (I was there in April)"
58,5.0,Long lanes to walk/Bike thru to see all the different areas of the park. A great place to bring a blanket and enjoy some sun on a patch of grass or a picnic with a S/O. Has areas to play basket ball or hold a stage for live music and a festival. I happened to be there on April 12th and it was the first day of the Cherry blossom festival.
59,5.0,"Excellent grounds for walking, running, cycling, picnicking or simply to chill. About 2+km circuit around the park. There are also mini parks within. Cherry blossoms were starting to come up. Have an icecream, coffee, redbean fish cake - it's all good."
60,5.0,We really didn't do to Yeouido Hangang Park for anything but cherry blossoms! we would have loved to bike around if the schedule permits us to do so.
61,4.0,"This was a great park to relax. Very spacious and clean, with the Han river right in front of you. It was pretty warm when we went, and around lunch time. We saw a lot of office workers, (maybe?) in their suits walking around. Right across the street is the Yeouido Park were many walk for a little exercise during their lunch break. I didnt know if it was fog or smog, but it was pretty foggy when we were there even though the sun was high. Yeouinaru Station exit 2 or 3 will get you to the Yeouido Hangang Park."
62,4.0,"If you are not looking for great quality food, you can eat at one of the food court at the park. Otherwise, I recommend to bring your own food or get something instant from convenient stores."
63,5.0,The most relaxing place there is.. Dont forget to rent a bike and cycle along the park.Negative review would be the Korean cyclists.. So fast!! Yeah they ride the bike so fast.. So find the place where they are few cyclist around so u can enjoy ur ride.. Bring along a tent if u got one.
64,5.0,"This is a place to chill at night, sunset is beautiful, you can picnic with loved ones, have dinner on one of the boat cruises, enjoy street performances! Best of all, rent a bike and cycle along the Hangang with the locals. Bike rental is affordable and the bikes are very new and comfortable to cycle on! One thing to remember is the river is quite long, so if you would like to complete the entire cycling route, you might want to rent the bike for one whole day, or at least 4 hours (which is still rather inexpensive), considering that you would need time to travel back to the rental shop.If you get lost, the good news is that bikes are allowed onto metros, you can easily find the nearest metro station and take the metro back to the Yeouido station, which is only a few minutes away from the rental shop. Bring a photo ID along, you'll need to deposit it with the rental shop and will get it back when you return the bike.PS couples, young families and friends will definitely enjoy picnics here"
