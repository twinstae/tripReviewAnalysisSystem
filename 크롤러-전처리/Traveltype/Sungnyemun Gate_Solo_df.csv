0,4.0,"One of the 4 main gates in Seoul, reconstructed many times most recently in 2008, Sungnyemun Gate is impressive and great for some photos, but not really much to do there.  There is a changing of the guard to add some colour (I missed it, but had previously seen the change at Deoksugung - its only a 10 min walk from Deoksugung to Sungnyemun).  It's a good place to start a visit to the Namdeamun Market (there is an underpass from Sungnyemun gate to the top of the markets.  Worth a quick stop and photo opportunity.  More photogenic than Dongdaemun Gate and easier to get a good angle."
1,4.0,"Of the 8 gates in this once walled city, this one was the oldest wooden structure in Seoul until an arsonist climbed up and set a fire which destroyed the wooden pagoda on top of the gate in 2008. It took 5 years and several million dollars to restore this National historic treasure. The Namdaemun Market nearby is named for this South Gate."
2,5.0,"Located in the centre of a busy junction there’s certainly a contrast between the surrounding office buildings and this cultural landmark. It offers a particularly good photo opportunity at night with the passing vehicle lights and is lit up beautifully. There isn’t a huge amount to look at but what is there is worth taking the time to admire, and there’s plenty of signage explaining the history and significance of the gate. Everywhere is well kept and clean, plus on my weekend visit it wasn’t busy with tourists either.Given that it’s free to enter the grounds and walk through the gate it’s a must see, certainly on a first visit to the city."
3,3.0,"Very large and historical gate that located in the central area of Seoul, convenient location, walking distance to Seoul station and  Namdaemun market. Entry is free. The superstructure was destroyed in the arson incident in 2008, and the restoration was completed in 2013."
4,4.0,This gate is the largest of Seoul's gates. It is surrounded by nearby sights such as the Namdaemun market and Seoul Station so it is easy to reach.
5,4.0,Saw this gate while walking from Seoul Station to City Hall. Consider it halfway if going to Myeongdong Market.
6,4.0,There is no charge to visit this large gate near Namdaemun Market.  This is the South Gate of the original four main gates of Seoul.  It was a bit surreal to see this gate from the 14th century surrounded by modern buildings.  There were guards dressed in period costumes standing by.
7,3.0,"This gate is located near Seoul station. If you take a train from Seoul, you might have a chance to take a look of it. This is much similar to that of many ancient cities in China."
8,4.0,The location is easy to find using google map. The location was closed for visits while I was there. Really beautiful at night.
9,5.0,"Not sure I would travel too far out of my way to see this, but was staying close by and the bus from the airport drove past this attraction so I decided to walk over and check it out. Am a fan of history but know pretty much nothing of Korean history. Admission is free and they have nice pamphlets that explain the role in history of this gate. A good job has been done in restoring the gate (especially after someone torched it not that long ago). The guards in authentic costume were more than willing to pose for pictures. Be sure to look up when going through the passage! It is closed on Monday's."
10,3.0,"It is good that city history is protected. However, nothing extremely special with this attraction. If you are around that region, then it may be possible to visit."
11,3.0,"Also known as Namdaemun Gate and sits next to the Namdaemun Market. It is considered Korea's National Treasure No. 1. Sungnyemun Gate is the largest castle gate stone structure  with an arched entrance in the middle. There is a column on top of a platform, raising the roof and distinguishing the upper and lower stories. Great photo op when visiting Namdaemun Market. Beautiful contrast between this medieval gate and the vibrant modern  buildings that surrounds the area."
12,3.0,"To be honest, the style of this gate is pretty jarring, set as it is in the sea of traffic, modern buildings, and large video walls that seems to be what defines Seoul.  It's quite pretty, ornate in a manner heavily in line with the styles I associate with China and Taiwan.Alas, there is no quiet here, as traffic is within spitting distance.Still, if you happen to be in the area, it's worth a look."
13,5.0,This place is a must visit when you are in Korea. Love the architecture and the way it's accessible and I come back over and over again Place visit
14,4.0,There is not s lot to see here however if you are in the area it is an interesting gate to come and see. There were guards present at the site but in general it was very quiet. I only happened to come here as I had to make an errand in this location.
15,4.0,"Not quite as big as Heunginjimun (the Great East Gate) but definitely bigger than the one in the southeast, this city gate with a ""stone base"" as the other two (not many such gates in the city: only these three plus Gwanghwamun which is the first gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace that I personally saw with such a base, and maybe the three gates in the north but I didn't get to those three) is worth checking out although it's kind of hard to ""imagine"" now with big roads and tall buildings all around it what an ""imposing structure"" this gate must have been back in the Joseon days.  In any case, it's a well-kept gate with some grass slopes and a nice piece of wall extending on one side, and I was also fascinated by these ""zodiac creatures"" on the edges of the roofs above the two levels of the gatehouse (also to be seen on the roof edges of pretty much all buildings of the city's palaces, I'm not sure if those zodiac figures are a kind of royal symbol or such).From Seoul Station (after arriving by train or the subway Lines 1 & 4), it's just about a 10-minute walk north along the big road Sejong Daero to get to this gate; and just about another 10-minute walk after passing by the Gate, you'll be at the big lawn beside the City Hall (two actually, the old city hall & the current ""all-glass"" one side-by-side) with the beautiful ""I (Seoul in a heart) U"" sign on an edge of the lawn; and about another 20-minute walk after passing by the City Hall, you'll be at Gyeongbokgung (the biggest of Seoul's five palaces) with first seeing the great statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin & king Sejong the Great before getting to the palace."
16,4.0,"Do not get me wrong, I am into Korean history and sightseeings. But this is basically just a gate in the middle of a busy road. You will have hard time to catch clear shot of this gate. Worth maybe for just 10 minutes or so, not more."
17,4.0,"There are 4 main gates to enter to the capital during chosun period ( early 20th to late 20th century). Namdaemun is one of them. The line 4 stops at hoehyun station, exit 5."
18,4.0,This is a pretty neat sample of history from Seoul. But make sure that you're there after 9 AM because they don't open before that. Very close to the downtown seoul train station
19,5.0,Sungnyemun(it means 'Admiration to politeness' gate) is famous for national treasure no.1 in Korea. It is also called Namdaemun(it means 'South' gate).  It shows early Joseon dynasty's(AD14~15s) architecture style.I recommend you to take a picture at night.
20,2.0,"This is a nice spot to take the touristic photo while in exploring the neighborhood around it. Walk in, take the picture in front of the gate, and proceed to the Namdaemun Market through the underground path adjacent to the gate entrance."
21,3.0,"Near Nandaemun Market, walking towards City Hall, I happened to find this gate. Several years ago, I heard this gate burned down, and after that, has rebuilt. Just seeing and taking some photos."
22,4.0,"This gate which is a reproduction due to it being burned down, it's in the middle of a busy traffic island. If you don't get to see any Korean gates then you must see this one!"
23,5.0,Closely located to Namdaemun markets. It is in the middle of an intersection surrounded by buildings so lovely mix between old and new.
24,4.0,"In the middle of the big, modern city - get transported back to the glory of another time.  Impressive gate and nice place to have a break and get inspired."
25,1.0,"It stands like a statue with nothing around it . So one can see it ,  take pictures and move on , that would be my advice"
26,4.0,I like the contradt between the old gate and the new buildings around it.Next to the gate is a market which is nice to walk around.
27,4.0,Its amazing to see these gates right on the road when u are driving through the city. its so nice that korea is keeping its authentic buildings maintained which actualy enhances the beauty of the city
28,3.0,"Namdaemun is a historical sight, but for me the most attractive thing is the import market nearby. In this market, you can buy many local products, clothes, food, drinks. And also some western imported stuff is available here. Intresting place, take 2~3 hours to enjoy the shopping experience."
29,5.0,"Big, nice gate in the middle of a huge square. Very nice for taking pictures and walk around. Don't stop a lot of time, but worth a few metro stops and minutes of walk."
30,5.0,"This gate is located in the middle of busy streets, which make it contrast with its surrounds and also a pretty interesting view and co existence of past and present. It is a beautiful construction itself but doesn't differ from the other gates, so it is not a must."
31,4.0,"It's located right in the heart of Seoul on the far-end from Gyeongbokgung Palace, through Gwanghwamun Square, to Seoul City Plaza & Deoksugung Palace. Actually, it's a misnomer to call it a gate because it does not lead to anywhere. It's just a beautiful structure built during the Joseon Dynasty and one of the 8 gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul which surrounded the city during that time. It dates back to the 14th century and is designated as the first National Treasure of Korea. Right next to it is the 24hr Namdaemun Market.. It is more stunning in the evening when it is beautifully illuminated & great for taking photos."
32,4.0,"Great southern gate of Seoul, located between the city hall and the Seoul railroad staion, is a nice piece of Korean traditional architecture. It was used as a checkpoint in the past when the city walls were still existent but nowadays it looks like a memorial. It is beautiful especially in the evening due to illumination. Nice for taking a few photos, but nothing more."
33,4.0,"A large and imposing piece of history in the middle of the city. You can walk around and under it, but no entry into the building itself. 15 minutes is probably enough to enter the gate, have a look, and take a few pics. Then walk along Sejong-daero Road for about 15 minutes and you arrive at Deoksugung palace."
34,4.0,"Korea's National Treasure #1, the 14th century historical gate (one of the 8 Gates of Seoul) was destroyed by arson in 2008. It was reconstructed over 5 years and reopened in May 2013. It is impressive in size and one can walk through the gate it to admire its beauty and size."
