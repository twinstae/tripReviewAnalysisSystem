0,5.0,"The good thing about SRT is that they are always on time, in the off chance they aren’t the platform has digital readout a that let you know how far behind. The biggest delay I’ve ever seen is 3 minutes. The cars are clean and offer overhead storage for bags. It was so quiet....no one was talking which was pleasant but also a little weird. The one bad thing is that you have to have a Korean credit card to pay online. You Dan by same day tickets at the station."
1,5.0,"Took the train from Seoul, Suseo to Busan. 2:15 hours! There is no way flight can ever compete! The ease and comfort is amazing! From city to city in two hours - wish er had that kind of High speed option back home. Awesome"
2,4.0,I had a long trip from North to deep South. Ticket is not cheap but you can enjoy confortable seats and wifi on board. If I want really find something wrong is there is no restaurant or bar for fresh cofee..
3,4.0,Also there is some competition now when you go for exemple to Busan - the SRT is still a safe and convenient bet
4,5.0,"This train ride takes about two hours between Seoul and Busan, substituting for about a four hour drive or very inconvenient plane trip. The 190 mph train is very smooth and it's easier to do work here than on a plane....by far."
