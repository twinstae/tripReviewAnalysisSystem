1,4.0,I visited twice. The view from the top is great. You can see Namsan Tower in the distance and the new Lotte Tower. That helps you realize how big Seoul is. Huge. It's an iconic building in Seoul so one should visit while in Seoul.
2,2.0,"Saw 63 City from a lot of Korean shows so I came here after a walk at Yeouido Hangang Park. Besides from the tall design of the building, there is not a lot to do. There is an aquarium and an art museum inside. Tickets are quite expensive and its crowded with tourists, especially tourists from China. Seriously don't recommend people to come."
3,3.0,"I took some friends here who were visiting Seoul for the first time back in January during my extended stay in Seoul. Because the 63 Building/Hanhwa building was featured in a lot of Korean dramas/shows, they had wanted to visit, but I wasn't too impressed. You do get a nice view of Seoul (some of my friends told us after that we should have gone at night, but I'm not sure about the hours or the discrepancy in price), but I just don't think it was worth the admission fee."
4,4.0,"As great as the view from N Seoul Tower may be, what you really want to do it view Seoul from the observation floor in 63 Building. The N Seoul Tower provides a great focal point in the city skyline which makes for a better view and better pictures."
5,4.0,"Went there yesterday evening before it got dark.  Just a very slight haze, but we could see probably 15 miles.  The view of the city is just incredible.  I don't know how much the admission was since it was paid buy our tour director, but it was well worth it."
6,3.0,"I was excited to visit this place when I reached Korea, since a lot of hype from friends of mine, when i got there, this place was just average but since there is a wax museum there and I never went to any Wax museum before, I tot i should give it a bit of points. Other than that, this place is just ok to me."
7,3.0,"This is confusing, so stick with me on this.  The 63 Building also called 63 City is really the Hanhwa Building.  There are no flashing lights advertising 63 Building, so do not look for it.  You will see Hanhwa Building at the top so head in that direction.  You will not see anything referring to ""63"" until you are right in front of the building.  You can take line 1, 5 or 9.  I took line 5, purple line since I was in the Jongno/Insadong area.  I got off at Yeouinaru station, walked for 30 minutes along the waterfront park.  Only after reaching the building and picking up a brochure, did I realize there is a free shuttle from the subway stop.  This is not stated in the guide book.  So, my pain is your gain.  Get off at this same station, take exit 4 and there should be a shuttle stop there.  Line 1, dark blue, get off at Daebang station, exit 6.  This building has an observatory deck which is also an art gallery, Sea World Aquarium, Wax Museum, and IMAX Theater.  I really only wanted the observatory, which was 12,000 won.  Go in main entrance, take a sharp left and walk all the way to the ticket counter.  The views are spectacular, and me and my friend were the only 2 people there and then an Asian family of 4 joined us.  We were the only people there, so I do not think it is that popular, but if you like a non busy uncluttered space you will like it here.  The main floor has many restaurants and coffee shops.  If your time is limited, I personally like N Seoul Tower better.  See my review about it."
8,3.0,"My wife cousin treated us to a day here, nice little tour great view and the Buffett was super food from everywhere."
9,4.0,We had walked more that 20mins getting to 63 Building from the Daebang Station. Missed our chance to enjoy the IMEX Theatre however the Skydeck is absolutely magnificient. The view of the city and Hangang River at night is simply magnificient.
10,4.0,"Enjoyed taking in the view up top at 63 City - the art gallery was also a nice touch while seeing the city landscape.  The Fish Market is close, but not walkable - you'll need to take a cab to get there and across the highway."
11,4.0,"There's not enough information in English, so it may be complicated for those who can't speak basic Korean. I thought we would be able to go to the 63th floor, but apparently we can only reach the 60th one. The view at night is nice, but the internal illumination interferes with the photos so maybe it would be better to visit in the afternoon."
12,2.0,"I quite enjoy scenic views, and this is a good one.  But as with many other cityscapes, it comes with a steep price.  Unless you've got upwards of 200+ dollars to shell out for a dinner, I would recommend going to the ""art museum"" which I feel is mostly an excuse to charge people 12,000 won to go to the top of the building.  The people looking at the art were outnumbered by people looking at the view 10 to 1.I have been to the ""Walking on the Clouds"" restaurant at the top, as well as the Imax, and both were expensive and nice for special occasions, but nothing blew me away. I would call this place a tourist trap, but most of the visitors are actually Korean, so it might be more of a status thing."
13,3.0,"The building appears to be golden in colour at afternoon till the sunset.  Not very far from the building there is a recreational area or garden of some sort where a lot of people (family, friends and couple) do actually just relax and play something. From the garden, you can approach the building you will pass by a bridge and will need to cross the road. There are a lot of things inside the building (wax museum and stuff) bit we did not go to any of those."
14,4.0,"Went to the top since it was on my bucket list and supposedly one of the top landmarks of Seoul. Really useful shuttle bus service going to and from there (via different tube stations), which was free! Loved the views from the top, was really amazing and kind of worth the 10,000 KRW to get up. Queues weren't long, and there were some great art exhibitions going on to."
