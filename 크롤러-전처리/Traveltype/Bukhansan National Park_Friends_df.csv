0,5.0,"Four of us took subway and continued with bus to the place. We overestimated that it is easy trail but the fact very tough in cold and partly snow which made it slippery. The best trail we had with scenery, stones, frozen rivers and finally we reached Bogungmun gate one of the castle’s gates. Another tough and different going down and took us 5 hours to complete."
1,5.0,"Great mountain hiking, spectacular views over the city of Seoul and just a quick transit from the city. We can see Seoul city at the top of the Mountain but the weather just a little bit cloudy. View the weather cast before hiking up ."
2,5.0,"We reached Gupabal at around 1020, took bus 704, following the people all decked in hiking outfits. Then there is a 7 minute walk to the base/ information centre. We started hiking up at about 1050 to BAEGEUNDAE peak. We probably walked about 1.5km before there was a big rest stop. Following that, there was 2 options to the peak - 2.4km advanced train & 4.1km easy trail. We kept right and went with the easy trail. Good thing about the easy trail is that it passes a long stretch of fortress walls, which was nice(pictured). We went on a non crowded day and at some points, we were the only ones on the trail and we might have gotten lost. The last ascent is quite steep and was quite challenging. But it is quite worth it!Going down, we followed a sign that said 2km to base (forgot the exact description). It was quite arduous, very steep and rocky. When we reached the base, we realised that it wasnt the same base as where we started. Instead, we had to walk a further 2km to the Bukhansan Ui station.In total, we took 3h to go up and 2h to go down. All in all, it was entirely worth it.If you can, I would reccommend bringing hiking shoes instead of trainers, or at least the grippiest pair of shoes you have. Certain routes and especially near the peak, it's mainly just walking along rocks which can be very slippery."
3,5.0,Bukhansan is the highest mountain around Seoul. it is quite tough if you have worked out for long time. It has beautiful steams along the trail and view from the peak is amazing!!
4,5.0,"My brother and I climbed up to the Baegundae peak, which is the highest one in the park. It was a great hike and the top was quite spectacular. However make sure to have great shoes. The last bit of the trail is very steep, sometimes slippery (even on a sunny day) and you have to pull onto ropes to climb. I could easily imagine that people who are too reckless  could very well fall and seriously injure themselves!"
5,4.0,"We checked out a lot of reviews and decided to climb Bukhansan based on the good feedback. It was indeed a fantastic climb with varying treks of cobbled path, stone steps, man made stairs and rock climbing. We started rather late at 1130am, but in hindsight was glad that we did as we missed the crowd entirely. The weather was perfect and didn’t get too hot at all, forecasted at 23deg. It took us just about 2hours to get to the peak. According to the iPhone health app, we climbed 200floors! Coming down though, we had read reviews about coming down the trail and getting to the Suyu Train station and was planning for that. We asked the guide at the peak which way to go and he pointed us in the direction saying it was a 1.5hr trek down. We walked for about 1hr and reached what seemed to be the base, the Begundae Information Centre, only to realise the actual base was a further 30-45minutes down a driveway road with pretty heavy traffic. The train station at this end was the Uri Station, not Suyu. We’re not sure where we went wrong as there was only seemingly 2 ways to go at the top.In any case, there are taxis that will take you down to Uri station for 1000won per person, they will even squeeze 5 passengers in to maximise their profit. At this stage we were beyond exhausted and was glad to pay that 1buck for the 5-7min car ride. So if you have to hurry and want to do this hike, our journey only took us 4hours in total including stopping for a bite and photos along the way."
6,5.0,"It's very accessible and can reach the peak of the mountain within 2hr and 30min. The hiking course was intermediate and had tough short course before reaching the peak, but it's all worth the effort to hike to the top. Recommended to...- prepare hiking gloves for need to climb up holding to metal wire ropes- bring a bottle of  (iced)water. If you prefer to hike light, there is resting area on the middle spot where u can buy iced water for ₩2,000. - small snack to nibble on as there are few  amazing spots where u can eat while enjoying the amazing view. Not recommended to...- wear jeans"
7,5.0,"Hiking along the Seoul City Wall is very rewarding because of the stunning views to enjoy. But the path is steep and your knees should be in good condition. Take your water bottle, you will need it when temperatures rise."
8,5.0,"My very first hiking experience was Bukhansan, starting from Bukhansanseong and hiking up to Baegundae peak. The trails are beautiful and I got a lot of great nature shots along the way. The people I met on this hike were all very nice and friendly and when I got lost on my way down, a man volunteered to guide me all the way down and even all the way to the subway station. I had a great experience on Bukhansan."
9,4.0,"Excellent place for multiple hiking trails, various difficulties.We arrived at the entrance via Dobongsan station following the flow of Korean walkers in mountain-climbing gear.We went up to Uiam rock by Gubongsa and Cheonjinsa in 1200. Ascension sportive, it must be in good condition. Lunch break on the rocks with beautiful views of Seoul and the mountains"
10,5.0,"First visit to Seoul and worried due to language barrier and lack of info bubeforehand. However , it was so easy to get there. Took line 3(orange line) to Gudapal station , exit 1 and right away saw bus stop and took bus 704. You can see street signs leading to Bukhasan park and follow other hikers to get off. Park is in a suberb in very modern pretty area and gave us the feel of a ski resort village when you arrive at entrance. We went up to highest peak and found it challenging but it was totally worth it. Make sure you do carry lunch, water, hiking shoes (no tennis shoes), and flexible pants or shorts.  There are temples , waterfalls , restrooms and beautiful views on way up."
11,5.0,The trek up youngbong and down took 4 hours with a good sized group including a short stop for lunch. Adding the trek to the peak of baekundae was an additional 90 minutes. It was difficult in some areas due to the ice and snow. Most people had crampons on their shoes which were beneficial but not 100% necessary. It could be done without them but people were slipping a little and you had to hold on. It’s a beautiful hike with great views.
12,5.0,absolutely stunning views. i did the hike with 2 good friends. it took us 2.5 hours to hike up and about 3.5 to come down. Go earlier in the day so the path isn't crowded and the line at the top of the mountain (to take a photo with the flag at the top) isn't long.
13,4.0,"We chose to do the peak trail and inadvertently picked the difficult trail. It is quite steep up and then down but worth the calorie burning trek. I wouldn’t call this a typical bushwalk or hike as much of the walk s actually climbing over rock.They don’t kid you when they say that HIKING boots are recommended. We have normal sneakers and there were some parts that were quite difficult. As you get closer to the top, it gets much more difficult with the last 300 odd metres to summit literally climbing up steep rock with ropes to pull yourself up.If you are afraid of heights, you may not be able to summit as it is not completely fenced off. Calves were hurting for days afterwards but worth it."
14,5.0,It is great place to get back to nature. Many locals visit this place to keep their body fit and here and there you would find foreigners who would travel there to have a hike for their lifetime. Park itself is the standout among Seoul or nearby parks. Hike is pretty intense where you find certain place thet you have to have certain rock climbing experience.
15,5.0,"Bukhansan National Park has trails for all levels of hikers. Trail maps accurately indicate the level of effort required and trails are clearly marked in English and Korean. Our guide kept us moving at a comfortable pace for our small group of 4 and we were able to go to one of the peaks (Baegundae Peak) and down in 5 1/2 hours with a few very short breaks (including a lunch). Even if you don't climb to a peak, the views at various points along the way are spectacular. If you like hiking, then you should not miss this opportunity when in Seoul. Make sure you have proper footwear as you will need it to climb the rocky trails and the peak. And give yourself ample time to come back down in daylight. (We were there at the end of Oct)"
16,5.0,"Beautiful nature, nice walk until the top. you don't have the feeling to be next to Seoul. view is just no words for. if you love nature, you should go hinking in the nat. park"
17,5.0,"Well worth the trip!As a recommendation, take the train to the end of the line at Bukhansan Ui (light green). I can’t recall the exit number, but there is a bus depot around 50m from the station, and there is a free shuttle bus that will take you to the entrance for the hike to the peak. It was much more convenient than the route that we took which led to Dobong where we then had to hail a taxi. We found this shuttle bus on the way back so hopefully it works both ways!"
18,5.0,"We came here to do some hiking and get away from the city center for a day. We didn’t really have a plan and didn’t make it to the highest peak, but got some amazing views of the city from the route we took. We didn’t start our hike until after midday, so it was almost 6 when we came down. I would recommend starting a little earlier in the day. This is definitely a great way to spend the day in Seoul!"
19,4.0,"Planned a hike to the mountains and it was really enjoyable. We were a group of beginners and did not have any special equipment for the hike. Went on a pretty rainy day, so it wasn't very suitable for climbing, however, we did manage to reach one of the peaks. Ended up on the advanced trails which was very steep and physically challenging. The rain didn't help since it made the rocks very slippery and there were a few portions of the trails that were very dangerous especially in the rain. Overall, the experience was worth it because the view was awesome. Be sure to check the weather forecast before planning the trip and also be sure to know the route you are heading towards."
20,5.0,"Where you can enjoy mountain climbing in half day by subway in Seoul city,If the weather is not cloudy, you can see Seoul at the top of the mountain."
21,5.0,Went to climb Ulsanbawi (pardon the incorrect spelling) with a friend from Seoul. The hike itself was easy at the start but gets harder with the steep stairs and strong wind towards the end. The view at the top was spectacular and I really enjoyed the hike and views along the way. There are restaurants at the bottom of the mountain. (Apparently it is Korean tradition to eat the Korean pancake and drink alcohol at the end of a hike). Make sure you wear something warm and put on appropriate sun protections.
22,5.0,"One of the toughest challenges i have ever faced. This hike is about 836 metres high up a  number of tough terrain trails of rocky steps, travel slopes, forest trails, slope rope climbs and wooden staircases. The whole hike involves a range of categories from amateur to expert and can take 1hr 30mins to 2hr 30mins to climb to the top. There are some stunning views (unfortunately my climb was on a smog day) and there is more than one trail and other peaks. You can do some rock climbing or mountain biking if you don't want to go hiking. Also it is tradition to have a drink of Makgeolli (Rice Wine) at the top of the peak so don't forget."
23,5.0,The view of Seoul on a clean day is definitely worth the hike. The last part of the Baekundae peak's hike requires hiking shoes although I've seen people wearing sneakers. Be careful when going down as it can be slippery. On the way up there is a toilet and a place where you can buy icecream :)
24,5.0,"Two ladies on their rubber shoes tried to climb this majestic mountain and it did fill their eyes with awe and admiration on the view, the trees, the stones, the trails, the streams and the locals. It was not an easy hiking for a beginner but since we decided to climb the mountain we stop after 1.4 km away from the peak. No need for guide just follow the trails and the locals who are hiking, they will guide you also which way to climb. Free entrance and you need to carry your water and snacks if you havent had a full meal before the climb. There are easy and hard trails. Its was tiring but you can stop anywhere to admire the view and catch your breath. We went just after the rain and i was expecting to be slippery but its not. Just beware of small worms hanging on a spider strands along your way. Its cold and windy when we climb so be prepared with your clothes. Not sure during summer. Overall i would like to climb it again to the peak if had another chance. We stayed in myeongdong and we took taxi going there as the fair is the same with both of us taking the bus. We saw buses doing in and out near the park. Hiking gears was all around before going."
25,4.0,"We climbed the highest peak in an afternoon in Autumn. Views were stunning and such gorgeous autumn colours but its a tough hike. Rocky and steep, and towards the top there are sections you have to pull yourself up the nearly flat rock using the ropes provided. Not for the 'fair weather walker' and you need to have a decent level of fitness. I went up in trainers (sneakers) because I didnt have anything else, but I would recommend hiking boots for sure, and some gloves to protect your hands from the metal cable/ropes."
26,5.0,"For a quick hike up a mountain right within Seoul, Bukhansan would be your option. Weekends tend to get a little packed as the locals also hike the trails to the peak, though the crowds are still manageable as there are many trails."
27,5.0,"Trekking is super popular in Korea, really the national pass time. As such, there are trails for all levels of ability in this national park. Views are stunning. So many temples to visit and paths to get you all over the park. Unfortunately, the hardest part is finding information in English. Blogs help. Public transportation takes you almost anywhere around the perimeter of the park. Well worth the effort!"
28,5.0,"Bukhansan is located in the northern part of Seoul and has an elevation of 2744 ft.  If you are into hiking, there are several courses that you can take. On each course is a support center that has information about the park. It is not for beginners as it can be challenging as you climb the peak. I climb this mountain every year and each time I always thought it’s a never ending hike! On the trail you’ll meet all kinds of people: experts,  “strugglers,” tourists, and expats living in Seoul. Koreans are very friendly so don’t be surprise  if you get an invite to join them for a picnic on top of a boulder. At the peak is the most glorious view of Seoul!"
29,5.0,"As it has several trails, why don't you try one of these?This is not that big or spectacular, it has  quaint lovely trails ypu would love.."
30,5.0,"So beautiful and amazing. We visited in July and went to one of the top-outlook while it was still dark to watch the sun rise, and it was just incredible. So amazing like you were suddenly standing in another world. Really worth a visit"
31,5.0,"Great hike up the Bukhan mountain - definitely challenging enough, but not too hard and anyone without serious health issues should be able to do go up in a few hours. The final 300m ascent is something else, but the view and satisfaction is worth it!"
32,5.0,"We hiked up to Baegundae peak. Wow, what an experience! We finished a round trip in a little less than 3 hours. We did not stop for breaks at all on the trip. We began at the Bukhansanseong Fortress entrance. We had locals trying to stop us because they thought we would get caught in the dark but they had no clue how fast we were going up. Getting to the peak takes quite a bit of physical ability. At one point you’re pretty much pulling yourself up by a rope. It’s awesome if you’re up for the challenge. The view from the peak is second to none. This is a must stop when visiting Seoul."
33,5.0,"There are many trail, the highest peak is  Baegundae Peak (approx 2700feet). It took bout 2hrs to reach the peak, not an easy hike, but after reach the peak you'll get mesmerised by the view of seoul."
34,5.0,"My fist is the only highest thing on this place.All your tiring journey will be paid off by its beautiful scenery along the way, fresh air, awesome view at the top and satisfying feeling when you get the top."
35,5.0,There were so many different ways to choose from with various lenghts of routes. We didnt have so much time or the right equipment so we took one of the shortest routes. If I ever come back to Korea I would like to go for a longer tour. Really Beautiful nature.
36,4.0,"We started our hike at the Jeongneung Information Center. From itaewon, we took the Seoul Metro and get off at Gireum Metro station. From exit 3, I took bus 110B. After that we hike to daeseongmun gate and then to the peak, Baegundae. I had the taste of taking the toughest route towards daeseongmun gate. It was a great hike and along the way, you can spot the locals. At the daeseongmun gate, we had lunch and I was amused to notice the locals having kimbab. We managed to reach the top after 5 hours. It was a good hike! We ended off near Suyu station where there was some machine to blow dry my clothes and bag. What a hike!"
37,4.0,The views are wonderful however the hike can be very steep at times. I would say prepare ahead of time.
38,5.0,This place is great for people who love the outdoors. The park is so big and there are so many different mountains you can climb if you're a hiker. I've been to a few different parts of the park and each part has been stunning. There are also some areas where you can just go for a picnic or an easy walk if hiking is not your thing.
39,5.0,"I climbed up the mountain with my family on this holiday. We had a craving for some fresh air. Also, the weather was very nice!"
40,5.0,"This hike is not an easy one! Prepare ahead with a route, water, and plenty of food! But the view at the peak is well worth it. The hike is absolutely gorgeous."
41,5.0,"If you love hiking or trekking, Bukhansan is one of the best. It was Spring when I tried trekking. Go early in the morning  like 7:00 to enjoy going up. I do not have complete gear but I made it. Well, I am not telling you to do it also (because we can hike without nice pair of shoes for trekking or hiking in the Philippines). I saw many oldies who enjoyed going up. What I enjoyed was seeing those flowers blooming around. They were beautiful. I definitely do it again when I go back to Seoul."
42,5.0,"Highly recommend taking a day and hiking in this park.  There are many trails and I don't think it will be hard if you do not have a local, to get around.  It is hilly, but doable, even if you are not in shape."
43,5.0,This is something you should wake up early morning and head up the mountain. There are different routes depending on how challenging you wish your hike to be. Just make sure you bring plenty of water and a nice snack such as Kimbap to refuel you when you get to the top!
44,5.0,"Be ready to experience real hiking workload, but at the end you will agree that it's absolutely worth it. View from the top mountain is breathtaking. Sea, city and park panorama is amazing. Seoul is great city itself, but this sight must be included into your trip. So wear convinient for climbing outwear, get more water in your back pack and just do it! You will never regret."
45,4.0,"If you stayed in Itaewon then you could take a bus number 110B and wait till the very last stop. Straight to Bukhansan National Park main entrance. For me, it was good hiking for someone that is not really have a good fitness. Many trails to choose, from easy to extreme but at some point will meet at the same checkpoint. You can enjoy the view of Seoul city during this journey. And its look easy and yet so challenging especially when you about to reach the summit. Its kind of mix feeling for me to be on the summit but I guest it was good to challenge myself here to encounter my fear of height. And the view on the summit, especially during the sunny day is quite worthy with the trail I encountered."
46,5.0,Wonderful mountains!!! Great for trekking or hikking. Would defenitky recommend to anyone interested in nature.
47,5.0,"I took about 2 hours to climb to the top, spent an hour at the peak and took 1 and a half hours to climb down. The hike is an intermediate level I would say. It would be best to have proper hiking shoes because some of the rocks might be slippery. I wore sneakers for the hike, making my climb a lot more tiring but it was still manageable! The hike is really tiring but the view at the top is well worth it! Very important to bring enough water for the hike, at least 1 litre in my opinion. I would recommending bring some food too so you can picnic at the top! Kimbap is a great choice!"
48,5.0,"You will love this trip.  Only a 40 minute bus ride from central Seoul. Well maintained, there are paved walks if you want them.  Lots of temples and incredible flowers.  Very well maintained."
49,5.0,"There are numerous entrance to Bukhansan national park and there are different trails. We didnt reach the peak, but we enjoy the hike. We met mainly locals during the day."
50,5.0,"Superb view at the top! And though the path got relatively more challenging halfway through (the first half is nicely paved and even has stairs), it is well equipped with steel cables to provide support for people like me who are afraid of heights. The peak has quite a small area though so you have to snap your photos quick as people will just keep swarming up. Also, advisable to bring a windbreaker as it's very windy up there."
51,5.0,A must-do in Seoul !! The hike was challenging at times(be ready to use all fours)but it was absolutely worth the time and energy!!
52,5.0,"Celebrated my birthday march 9, 2016 at the top of Bukhansan Mountain. Started trekking at 8:30 in the cold morning ( forgotten which base we entered). I was with a Priscilla , Malaysian- Canadian i met in the hostel. It was the best birthday ive ever had in my life. Saw lots of locals and foreigners in small and big groups. We reached the top of the mountain and you can see the whole city from the top. Took lots of pictures, stayed for a while , we went back after we were fully rested. A must place to visit for all, not good for children though"
53,5.0,My friends and I actually climb this moutain to the peak and when were halfway up there we realized that we've been climbing at advance level and to the peak its expert! No wonder we were tired but it wass all worth it as you felt a sense of accomplishment up there
54,5.0,I love this park! They have so many different paths to get to the top depending on your skill level. Totally worth taking a day to hike!
55,5.0,"Located in the near approximately twenty minutes from Uijeongbu, Bukhansan offers caustic views amongst the wildernesses; a far cry from the bustle of the city. You are greeted by a traditional temple which we were fortunate to visit on a day when monks walk the grounds willing to give a history of the location, a blessing for good health, and a cup of local tea and a pastry. Restrooms are plentiful and clean. Stop by the small restaurant for a bit to eat or a hot tea. Scrambling is necessary in many areas but if you're up for the challenge the scenery is worth it. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes."
56,5.0,"To climb to the top of the mt you might need about 2 hours, and it's definitely worth it. The view was spectacle there on the top, but you probably need a pare of climbing boot to avoid some potential injuries."
57,4.0,A great place to experience a local hike in the outdoors and meet locals. Very accessible with a bus trip stopping in front of the national park. Just 45 minutes from the city centre. Trails are well marked and beautiful maintained.You will be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city if you make it to the peak.
58,5.0,"From Gangnam Station, the taxi ride was mere $25 with tip (45 min), to the entrance roundabout. The taxi driver forewarned us that there would be any public transport from the drop-off/entrance back down to the town. Indeed, there is no public transportation on the way down from the park entrance to the local bus terminal. Obviously, there wasn't enough parking space for all the park visitors either. There was no one leaving the park when we arrived. I thought we would call for the taxi later, but, later, it turned out that the dispatchers said no driver would come up to pick us up either, although it was only 5 min. ride to the entrance. No Public Buses, either. Later, another taxi drivers in Seoul told me that, over the weekends,  only a few taxi drivers would hang at the entrance to pick up the hikers back to the subway or bus terminal for the quickest and shortest ride at the fixed higher fare (illegal) but, I thought that would be better than no connecting service. Now the physical and mental preparation_________________Plan ahead for the rough day if you hadn't exercised for a while, or  feeble. And, try to make it to the Stone wall Gate North at the castle wall (Bukhan Sanseong), that is, IMO,  how far the younger and shorter ones could get to, but none of these courses are suitable for little ones. Now, the really steep part is the next 20 min. just a bit further beyond the Cabin Rest Stop (with log seats), but it was manageable with log steps and metal steps. The last freaky part after the Stone wall gate, was beyond my limit. No one told me that Stone wall gate was just the middle stop, before the next challenging leg. It was windy, and, if you miss any control of your balance, there is no tree or flat ground to catch you anywhere. Frequently pulling your body weight dangling to the metal wire rope rails, you will feel you are soaring above the tree lines to see the distant vista to Modern Seoul fabrication. This is where others said you need a Sun Screen. It appeared that I was standing on one giant grey granite formation in the last leg to the top.  Again, if you are not able to pull your body weight and lift your legs up high up on your chest leaning on the ropes for quite a distance (vertically) in this last leg (Stone wall gate-Top), you should stop at the stone gate of the castle walls. Upon this far up, you will have already experienced quite good mental and physical challenging moments and it would be equally rewarding looking around at 360 degree from the mountain top.Again, don't ""exhaust"" yourself until  you see the last leg begins at  the cabin rest stop. And, the stone wall gate next.Even for this short trip, you will need a proper gears_________________The high-neck hiking boots and the anti-slip gloves are a must! Lots of Korean Climbers brought walking sticks and they were wearing mountain gears that are bright and flexible. Unlike those Fit Korean Climbers, one of us was a big guy with some disability. He gave up at the cabin rest stop, which meant we had to come back to the same route to descent, instead of several other options to exit the park on other trails. But, I am glad he stopped there as it was impossible for him to climb the last legs. There are lots of sings, in Korean,  that warns the elderly and the cardiovascular unfit people not to climb, it wasn't just the “at your own risk” sign. No Wonder why we saw a remote police station along the trail earlier. Until I tried the last leg, I did not know I was the unfit case myself. I was out of breath just short of one last turn to the top of the world, I exhausted myself too soon thinking the stone wall gate was the stop. The shaky legs and the spinnning head tells me to stop, while my arms were pulling my whole body weight on the ice cold metal rope fo quite a while.  And, these descending group climbers would not give any room for me to continue upward.At the top of the last step, I freaked out, and there was no one in sight. And, minutes later my buddy who was ahead of me returned and said I just missed the last turn. But,  I did not have any energy left.And, I was thinking of a leisurely climbing like Mt Sorak. But, this last bit is not for the amateurs. I can now believe the annual casualty reports at the base info center.  One climber said later that he could not get to the top for the past 20 years, until the park management laid the metal rope rails and metal steps.The afternoon Sun was warm and downcasting its golden rays onto the city. Who knew that one could experience the nature so close in the city? I thought it was a bless to the Seoulites. It is within Seoul, and short, yet quite challenging to anyone. The rocks are ridiculously beautiful and vista at the top was woeful. In comparison to Mt. Sorak National park last year, near Sokcho city (East of Seoul)where the trails were slow, fun and minimally challenging. this Baekun-dae trail, although I was told that it is only the beginner's level, I find it much harder than Mt. Sorak. Or, I am simply older and unfit. The descending was less tiring but it took us quite a while being careful not to hurt our joints or spines. 2 + hours. Altogether it was 5+ hours for us with lots of mini stops. No Public Transportation service to the town_______________________Now, back at the foot of the entrance, as the night falls, the temple shuttle bus driver refused to pick up the last group of the climber, unlike we were told. With no available Taxi, I even called for the taxi but no taxi would want to come up to pick us up.  We had to walk down another 35 min. in the dark path, spotting the wild boars along the way, to the bus terminal. What I find ridiculously unsafe was, the asphalt road was all well-lit, but the walking path down, was separated and often above the road level, with uneven ground or steps. In the dark night, it was really dangerous. And, we noticed some abandoned dogs approached us probably for food. Then, almost half way down, we saw the same bus passing by us with the climbers on the bus. Why didn't he take us in the first place? I have no idea.We grabbed a random local bus heading to South of Seoul, Gangnam (well, I could read Korean to use Korean Transport app). Otherwise, the destination on the buses was clueless for a foreigner. Many other buses were heading further North East. After 20+ stops, we got off the bus at a busy commercial area where we could find a taxi.This limited access to the transportation after exiting the park made us feel vulnerable and quite annoyed. But, the whole half a day trip out here was really memorable. And, I can see its rank on TA is soaring, too. So, when you plan to come to Seoul, pack your hiking boots,  gloves, and a bright windbreaker jacket.We really enjoyed the day.Duration :  5+ hours"
59,5.0,"A good place to hike. Hike in South Korea is a must to do experience. You can hike without food and the Koreans that you meet during the trail are more than happy to share with you their food and rice wine. Beautiful view. I was very lucky to meet a guy, that explain me a lot of things about of the mountain and showed me some rocks with particular shapes, that I couldn't notice if I was hiking by myself."
60,5.0,"Not too rough yet challenging enough for a day out in Seoul. A steep climb for last 1km route but well equip with stairs and rope. Took us almost 4 hours to and fro while the park assistant told us about 2 hours plus. We went on beginning of October, suppose to be nice chilling day but the sun was too kind to us. Make sure you have sun screen with you all the time. After all, we had really good time.We took subway till Gupabal station then transfer to bus (704 or 34) then walk about 5 mins to park entrance. Just follow the local or other tourist :) Bring some snacks along. There are many restaurant near park entrance, those with english menu mostly more pricey; the local stall offer good food but language may be problem."

The journey took about 45 mins and costs W30,000 by taxi metre. Some taxis refused to go, maybe because it is an outskirt drive. It is advisable to get the hotel concierge to write down the address of the information centre in Korean and the telephone number too, to show it to the taxi driver. Our taxi driver called the info centre to confirm the direction and venue. We were happy to have met a taxi driver who is kind and friendly. It was ultimately a wise decision as we avoided the crowded metro and bus rides, and the 35 mins walking up the mild slope to the information centre from the bus terminal. The climb wasn't an easy one I must say, but manageable with intermittent rest during the climb. Some climbs were steep and rocky, a few flight of long stairs too. It is definitely not recommended for children, especially at the final climb to the peak. You will need to hold on to iron railings and step on the steep rock in order to climb up to the summit.Proper covered track shoes or mountain shoes must be worn, otherwise your foot and toes will get cuts from rocks and stones. There is a rest station midway, where you can purchase drinks, ice cream or cup noodles. A few decent toilet stops are available too. The climb to the summit took us about 1.5 hours, and is certainly worth the effort. Along the way we see beautiful autumn leaves, forests, magnificient mountain views at the top and breathtaking scenaries. It is advisable to start the trail earlier, with lesser mountain climbers. The crowd picks up gradually. When the peak area is packed with people, it makes it harder to climb up and down the narrow and steep slope. Happy climbing."
62,5.0,"It is relatively easy to reach the entrance by public transports. We took the easy trail, rocky mostly. Regretted i wore the thin-sole hiking shoes, as i was not aware of the rocky trail. but it is definitely awesome view at the summit! we brought coffee but no food and that's really bad! overall, check the weather for the best time and day to hike as we went during rainy season and based on weather forecast, we started hike at 10am instead of 7am and that is totally fine. entrance is free but u need to pay a small fee for the map."
63,5.0,"We wandered around a short trail on the park which still took a few hours to complete and let us see some amazing views of the surrounding mountains. There are a few temples dotted around the park too, which are great to discover. There are plenty of maps located around the trails too."
64,4.0,"This is a great national park conveniently located in Seoul by subway and then a short bus ride away. The view from the top is great,  if only they had a bit more to see at the Base of the national park.  Still it's not seorksan or jirisan national park. But it's a great way to spend a day in Seoul in autumn."
65,5.0,"This national park covers a huge area, and the walks we tackled were quite difficult and involved literal rock climbing - not for the feint hearted! We entered via suyu station and then no.2 bus to Hwagyesa temple. From there it was a steep climb to the top, only about an hour, but many tracks we followed signs to the 'ridge walk' and then just followed any heading upwards. The most breathtaking views at the top!"
66,4.0,"We went to Bukhansan mainly to hike. When I hiked it three years ago, I swore I would never do it again. It was a challenging hike. But then I went back the year after and again and again. The hike is challenging but enjoyable. I met so many people on the trail - professional hikers, students, locals, tourists and it's always so much fun to talk to them - about life, about hike, about Korea. The most rewarding part is reaching the summit. It's simply beautiful up there. I am not a professional hiker, not even amateur. But I have learned that I just need to take it slow, enjoy the people you meet, and enjoy the beautiful scenery."
67,5.0,"i usually go to bukhansan and other mountains near seoul with my friends.. there are so many different beautiful places and courses.. im not good at english but we have many experiences in hiking.. so if u wanna join us and share hiking experiece, that will be very greatful! if wanna contact us, plz give a message.(kakao talk; whygain86 --add friends)"
68,5.0,"Bukhansan is a beautiful hike and one of the hikes that first made me fall in love with hiking to begin with. If you live in Seoul or are just traveling and want to do a hike in the city, Bukhansan is definitely the best of the bunch, and it is one of my personal favorite things to do in Seoul.One great aspect of it is that there are multiple routes to the top, so you can do the hike in a few hours, or you can spend more time exploring the mountain's trails and peaks and make a whole day out of it. Whichever one you decide, you will not be disappointed. The contrast between the rocks and the trees make for astounding views of the mountain, and once you get to the top, the views are just as breathtaking.Signage to get to the top of the mountain is also plentiful. It's easy to navigate where to go, and if you get lost, you can always follow the horde of Koreans also making their trek to the peaks! Just make sure to stock up on water and snacks for the hike, and prepare for a great adventure. It's one that shouldn't be missed."
69,5.0,It's very beautiful moutain near Seoul city dwontown.Bi-Bong(비봉) was best site to see the Seoul's sky line.It's not long route so that you can tour 1/2(6h) day tour.Starting point is I-buk-oh-do-chung(이북5도청). and You must ware the hiking boots.
70,5.0,I would love to come here again! The views are spectacular and your fellow hikers will sure offer you some of their food!
71,5.0,"This place is suitable for nature lover, but bear in mind, please do wear appropriate clothes based on the climate/season you visit that mountain. I wore a winter jacket during winter, but still, the strong wind will make you freeze."
72,5.0,"This was a really good half a day out. But be careful I would only recommend you do the hike in good weather as most the track up is rock, stones and mud. There are two trails up to the peak a beginner/intimidate and an advanced both which a fun to climb and both have amazing views and temples to stop at along the way     The views from the top are incredible but make sure you take some food and drinks with you!"
73,5.0,"gogogogogo Don't miss out on an amazing trek. Might be a little tricky for those who suffer from hights, but all well if you are with others. Join Meet up group Climbing in Korea, they organise lots!"
74,5.0,"Despite reading blogs online regarding transportation of bus and train, if you are staying in the northern part of seoul, just take a taxi as it is around the same price.Do check the weather frequently if you are coming, especially in the summer, as the terrain will be several folds harder if it does rain. If you arrive at the base and you see many other people there, you'll know its safe to go. Some routes may be blocked if there was heavy rain during the past few days. I couldn't see a waterfall because of that.Terrain wise, even though the route i took was rather long, seeing Wonhyobong peak and then Baegundae(highest peak @ 836.5m). Despite being relative beginners at hiking, the terrain is very manageable. There aren't any areas where you have to go on all fours to climb. Be warned though that the peak does look a little scary, but there are metal ropes for you to hold onto. Hiking sticks can be easily found near the bases and i got one for 5k won. It is a good investment imo.There are also rock climbing routes that seem well maintained."
75,4.0,"So, got persuaded by friends to hike up Bukhansan. Seems easy on paper to say the least, but that's what they said about Calculus too. Journey to the park itself was pretty manageable and accessible. There was a kind soul handing out free packets of wet tissue near the park entrance too, good start. Slowly realised we were so so ill prepared for the hike. I was in jeans, two of my group were in berms/shorts. We wore running shoes, where traction was not a guarantee in the terrain. And that's not a good thing. Local folks had like hiking shoes, hiking sticks, proper hiking outfit and they were struggling alrdy. Just imagine how we did it without those. Kudos to us indeed. Views were spectacular at the peak. Felt great when u can take a short nap at the peak after the arduous journey up. Then slowly come to the realisation that what goes up must come down. Yup, u would need to take the same route down. Some sections of the hikes are really steep and hardly have any steps or rocks to step on. U just need to grind on the sole of ur footwear and hold on tight to the metal ropes along the way. TL:DR - if you like to take in some fresh air, enjoy some scenery of Seoul at the peak, have a good workout, hike up Bukhansan. If not, stick to reading reviews and start convincing ur friends and urself to go visit Myeongdong instead.Oh, do bring loads of water and some snacks up. Great to have a picnic up there. Wished someone told me that earlier sigh."
76,5.0,"Spent the day hiking, took a wrong path and got a bit lost, turned a 4km hike to a 12km one, fantastic views the whole way, friendly locals. Great day."
77,5.0,The hike was moderately challenging. There are various trails to climb and peaks you can summit. It was pretty easy to find after getting off the subway- just follow all the people in hiking gear and if you get lost just say Bukhansan to a local and look lost and they will happily point you in the right direction. The views from the peaks were fantastic and the hikes take about 3-4 hours roundtrip. Bring a snack and water so you can relax and enjoy the view at the top!
78,5.0,"You have to do this -- it's gorgeous.  But know that some routes have, say, a chain or rope that you have to use to get up/down, and even when you get to a top point, you still hear the city/traffic sounds, which is odd."
79,4.0,I went to the Bukhansan through Bogukmun st.I'm not good at hiking it was enough to see many locals especially Ajummas.It's not easy to imagine there is a huge national park in Seoul.
80,4.0,"A lot of locals go there for hike. There are quite a numbers of routes, be sure to ask the information counter before proceeding. Can be quite challenging if you are not a season hiker. However the view at the peak is worth the effort."
81,5.0,"amazing hiking trip, lot of locals go there, but the views are so worthy, experience you can not buy, only walk for it"
82,5.0,this place is amazing for hiking especially since its really close to the city and you can get there easily . once you get there you leave all the hassle of the city and you find your self immediately inside nature and fresh air. the roads are maped and it has good facilities
83,5.0,"Bukhansan is fantastic. It's quite close to various parts of Seoul by subway and bus (the city has grown around the sides of the national park so you could hike across it and end in a very different area from where you started) and yet it is a grand, majestic and natural space.In terms of hiking there are some tough but perfectly manageable courses, the peak of Baegundae being the toughest. But there are also pleasant valley trails that are easy on the knees and pleasantly shaded by trees. A real highlight is the ruined gates of the old Bukhansan fortress wall, some of which have been restored. It gives an historic dimension to a natural experience."
84,5.0,Great view and not too far from Seoul. Walking up 1.5-2 km to take a break at the beautiful antique temple. Then go to the rooftop of the Seoul!!  Best experience at Seoul.
85,5.0,"My friend and I hiked Baekundae Peak, the highest peak in Bukhansan, and what a trek it was! The park was easy to reach, just take a bus from the metro station. We thoroughly enjoyed the hike and the spectacular views, but it was probably the most difficult hike I've ever attempted. The trail goes from mild slopes to intensive stone steps to scaling sheer rock with the aid of a rope. Towards the top, everyone had hiking poles and chains on their shoes because the summit was icy. We were a little under prepared for the difficulty of the hike, but we persevered and the views were well worth it. I recommend climbing Baekundae if you enjoy an intensive hike. If you are looking for a casual stroll in which to snap a few photos of a view, Baekundae is not for you."
86,4.0,"Went there with my professor from Uni and had a good time hiking. Nice view and has several different paths. Honestly, had a really hard time going down but was so ashamed when old ladies and men were constantly passing me."
87,5.0,"Went during the last week of December, up the route to the highest peak. The signs were in Korean mostly so we accidentally went up the intermediate - advanced route instead of the beginner route. It was very cold, and things got a big snowy and icy as we progressed. At the top, you are climbing up rock face. There are wire cables to haul yourself up and hold onto and steps hewn into the rock in some places. It was icy, and my friend who had worn runners which had hardly any grip could not get any traction at all in some places. I was wearing boots so I was okay, but there was a couple parts where we slipped and if we hadn't been hanging onto the cable we would have probably slipped off the side and fallen to either death or serious injury. I was glad I did it, but we definitely should have been more prepared. If you are going up in winter, bring gloves (that are able to grip cable), hiking boots or shoes with good tread (maybe ice spikes as well), a hat to cover your ears, and enough water and snacks for 6 hours. You need to be in recently decent shape, especially at the top where you need upper body strength to help pull you up. We started at about 10 and got down at about 4. There were many people also doing the hike, so we just followed other people from the station to get to the mountain and back, as per other trip advisor reviews."
88,5.0,"One of my favorite hiking places in the world.  Easy access via public transit, loads of restaurants near the Dobong Metro Station, sweet views along the ridge lines and beautiful temples.   If one even mildly likes outdoor activities, then this is a place that should be on the list of attractions if visiting Seoul."
89,4.0,If you are a fan of climbing or hiking a mountain this is the place for them. Mountain is not that high and rough. And its national park cleanness will help you take a deep rest.
90,5.0,"A hike through the park at the start of winter offered a kaleidoscope  of colours, fresh air and unforgettable views."
91,5.0,"Koreans love hiking. Feel local by taking on Mt. Bukhan. If you are diehard for the local experience, then take your lunch including hot soup and side dishes up the mountain too. Forgot some essential hiking gear? All you need can be found in the various shops on the foot of the mountain. Bukhansan National Park is immensely beautiful, with also a temple to visit if you take certain paths where you can do a temple stay. Most people want to reach the peak of the mountain however. And there is the possibility for extreme sports for daredevils unafraid of taking on vertical lines.I took a trail of about 6/7km from one side of the mountain to the peak and going down the other side. Hiking path is very accessible, though on some intermediate/expert levels it does include taking on steep paths for which you might need your hands for extra support, though there is no real hoisting yourself up involved. I was a bit daunted by the word ""expert"" since  I never hiked before coming to Korea, but even 70 year old ladies took that trail on, so why shouldn't you? Do expect to feel your calves burn. There was a queue up to the peak of the mountain at the last bit to the peak, which was a funny interesting  experience. Everybody neatly lined  for  the same Kodak moment. That view however was breathtaking and so worth it! All in all took me 5 hours.Excellent day trip!"
92,5.0,"Went on a weekday, although the there were still lots of people in the bus and a short queue there were not too many people. We went from Bukhansanseong to Baegundae peak. Good views and, as it is very developed, you don't need anything other than comfy shoes, water and maybe some snacks. If you have moderate fittness then this route will only take a couple of hours, but give your self more time as you will want to look around and there are lots of small detours you can make. We followed the advice given by others and went in the morning which worked out well as we got a little off the beaten track and climbed about, meaning we stayed most of the day. We also took bus 704 from Gupabal station. Looked like buses were very regular and both 704 and 34 stop at the enterance. Highly recommended escape from the city."
93,5.0,Best views! It's a serious hike to the Baegundae Peak! We took the Bukhansanseong Fortress Course up but ended up taking a different path down. Bring food and water as there will not be any chances to buy it after you leave the entrance.  Also in the autumn you will want to layer your clothing as it will be hot as your hiking up but cold at the top!And recommend going on a weekday otherwise you'll have to contend with thousands of Korean hikers.
94,5.0,"It is very crowded, but it worth it! Take a trip to Baegundae Peak. It is the highest mountain at Bukhansan. The view is amazing. Not suitable for small kinds, the trip is is in some places very advanced. Take good shoes and food, u can eat at top of the hills. It is 800 ascendence of 5 km."
95,5.0,"It is a free attraction and is very popular in Seoul. To avoid the crowd, we went for an evening hike. I would not recommend doing this to everyone as it is a little bit dangerous due to the darkness. However, the view at the top was breathtaking. There was beautiful Seoul at night on one side, and darkness on the other. An experience we will not forget!"
96,5.0,A wide range of hiking routes at different levels.  Easy access by public transportation like metro and buses.  Clear signage and map along the path.  You will see how Korean love hiking.
97,5.0,"It was my first time hiking a mountain , thus it was a great challenge.The steps get steeper when we were reaching the peak and climbing down was tedious. Luckily we met a helpful ajusshi who helped us navigate the way .Other hikers were cheering for me when I looking worn-out. There's a small stream at the end of the trail, we soaked our strained feets in the ice cooled water was relaxing ~"
98,4.0,"Did my hike today. This is one of the more accessible mountain from the city. I reached here by taking the metro to Gireum station and bus 110B till the last stop. Just follow the koreans professionally dressed in their hiking attire and you wont be lost. A pity the map at the beginning of the entrance is written only in korean. It wasn't detailed enough on how the exact route to take to reach baegundae peak. Hence, it was pretty much guesswork most of the way. Along the way, stop by for a breather and to snack. Some of the local people even offered us food and they were also very friendly. Good to trek with some friends so that you wont feel lonely. Overall, a great workout. It is also very clean mountain as people take their trash along with them instead of throwing it everywhere."
99,5.0,"Went with a couple of friends. As everyone else stated, it takes a couple hours to get to the top but wow, is it worth it!! On the steeper portion of the climb/hike there are staircases and cable rails to guide and assist your momentum. Well worth the sweat. I would gladly do it again. Take a lunch and plenty of water for the hike up. You can relax at the many flat spots for lunch. There is a small store on the way down the other side that sells drinks, so you're not in land of the lost by any means."
100,4.0,"We had a good time and getting here was easy enough. But we climbed stairs for and hour and a half for underwhelming views. Nice break from the city, but meh."
101,5.0,"We took some time to hiking the trails on our trip to Seoul, and it was well worth it! It is very serene, it is hard to believe you are so close to the city. A must see if you love the outdoors!"
102,5.0,"This is worth the hike! If you're on the fence about climbing a mountain, I encourage you to go for this one.The only complaint is that I needed to use my inhaler halfway up. :P But that's on me, not the mountain! I met a couple of kindly older gentlemen and we shared a picnic under the trees at our highest point of our trip.Great view of Seoul!"
103,5.0,"wonderful hike, lots to see and a great workout. Really a must do when in the area!Dont miss the chance to visit."
104,5.0,Go to gupabal station and take bus 704. Then prepare to spend several hours conquering Bukhansan. The road was long so bring sufficient water; 3-4 Liter should be adequate. The forest walk was uneven and full of rocks and dirts and remember this: climbing is tiring but it is less risky while descending down was easier but more dangerous. The mountain hike is the grand finale of the trip as you can see Seoul clearly from the top. Bear in mind that you need to be extremely cautious near the peak as there is no proper place to step but they do provide us with ropes to grab on into.prepare your camera as the view either at the top or in the forest are both worth the taking. Don't rush! my friend sprain his  knee when he slipped on our way back.P.S. You might want to consider carrying extra ration or have lunch first before start climbing. remember there is no public toilet except halfway through the climbGood Luck!
105,5.0,"If you aren't so much a city person, you must go here to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. If you are an outdoorsy person, but don't have enough time for one of Korea's many gorgeous national parks, then this is a nice alternative, just a short bus ride from Seoul.From the Bukchon Hanok village, we took a bus up to Bugaksan mountain. From the bus stop, it is a short hike until you reach the old city wall. While not as impressive as the Great Wall of China, it was still an impressive wall that followed the jagged mountain tops and encircled the city, and offers beautiful scenic views and great views of the city. Because there is a military area somewhere along the wall, they check your IDs at a certain point. This place closes at 3 pm so make sure you go early enough to get through the gate at 3 pm. In my opinion, best to visit in autumn when the mountains are red and orange, but I'm sure its beautiful all year round."
106,5.0,"This is one of the most memorable things that we did during our visit to Seoul. Mr Koo the park ranger at the entrance is one of the most energetic and helpful guys I met in the whole of Korea. He gave great instructions and tips on which routes to take up the mountains and even offered to come personally in the 112 helicopter if we critically injured ourselves. The path up the mountain is pretty good and would be achievable for people who are not experts, despite the signs. I wouldn't recommend the very top for the less fit people, it takes a bit of upper body strength to pull yourself up the ropes/rails for the last 30 metres. At the top, the view is great. Overall our round trip took 3 hours and 40 minutes with some needed stops. The atmosphere within the park is quite good, although not as pleasant as some other hiking I have done in France and Australia etc. It was still a great break and you get a great fashion show of locals in full hiking gear sporting every colour of the rainbow.Take the metro to Dobongsan metro station and then cross Dobong-ro on the overpass and then pedestrian crossing and head south 100 metres and turn onto Dobongsan-gil. Follow this wide road past all of the hiking shops including Mountain Hardwear, Patagonia, Mammut etc. Keep going straight and you will eventually find the park entrance after about 1km. If you are hungry just cross Dobong-ro and go straight when you come out of the station, many BBQ places which was maybe not the best idea before a large hike."
107,5.0,"The trails are easily accessible and well entertained. Yes it's hard to climb to the peaks, but it's absolutely worth the while!  The view is worth the while when you are up at the top! Absolutely stunning views!"
108,5.0,"The main peak trail is harder to get to.  Takes a while by bus.  The peak on the north west is reachable by train.  But to get an early start, my friend drove there by car.  Trail very well maintained, but not much English signage.  Hope u don't go the wrong way.  It gets steep and rock after the first half.  But at 700m of elevation gain can be peaked in 2-3 hrs.  The air was very hazy when I was there so can't see much of the city."
109,5.0,Getting to the peak was not so easy but it was definitely worth it.Make sure you have water and snacks and bring your hiking gear if you got some.
110,5.0,"This was a really fun place to hike and get away from the craziness of Seoul. We hiked all the way to the top of the highest peak here, and it was definitely a challenging hike. Certainly doable if you are in decent shape, but expect a sweaty and challenging hike (especially if you go in the summer).The views from the top are great, and if you go during the week it isn't too crowded."
111,5.0,"If you're in Seoul and want to get out of the concrete canyons, head to Bukhansan NP. There are two mountains within the park - Bukhansan (North of the Han Mountain), and Dobongsan (Toaist Peak Mountain). Both are spectacular, varied, and can be climbed in a day. There are numerous access points depending on which route you choose. Personally, I prefer Dobongsan, as I have been up there more times than I can count and know it very well. The best place to access Dobongsan is from Dobongsan Station on the Seoul Metro Line 1. Exit the station, turn right, cross the main road and head up through the area of food stalls, restaurants and outdoor gear shops. Keep heading generally away from the station and towards the mountain (you can't miss it) and eventually you'll reach the park entrance. It's free to enter the park. Once you're in, you'll see a big map, and the trails are well signposted. This is definitely a place to come to get away from the 21st century, although at weekends there are painfully large numbers of Korean hikers, who dress very brightly, and make a lot of noise. If you want to escape them, try leaving the main trail when you see the first temple. Everyone else will turn left, but if you go straight on across the open gravel area, you'll be on a trail that fair fewer people use. It still leads to the summit, but you will have to tackle a few stretches that are quite steep and require the use of handrails - only do this if you are pretty fit, and do not suffer from vertigo."
112,5.0,"Great view from the top. Mountains are a must see. Don't forget to wear the right shoes but don't be discouraged from the locals dressed from head to toe in gear. ( Korean style) At the top, it is typical to drink Makegolli ( Rice wine) and eat kimchi ( the square radish kind to be exact!) Makes the trip down the mountain easier. PLEASE use caution and be mindful/careful. This is a cultural norm but it doesn't mean you have to do it!"
113,4.0,"Hiking up Bukhansan is one of those things you should do to get a good South Korea experience. Hiking is the number one sport amongst a large group of (senior) Koreans. This makes that there are a lot of excellent hiking trails in Korea. The one to reach the peak to Bukhansan is quit easily accessible with the subway. A short busride after that will get you at the start of the climb. The climb itself is not too difficult although some parts are somewhat steep. Be prepared however that, since hiking is super popular in korea, and the fact that the trail is easily accessible, you have to share the experience with a lot of people. When you get closer to the top, you will be walking in a row. This however, is part of the experience in my opinion. The view when you reach the top is magnificent and worth the effort."
114,5.0,"Went mid-day on a Friday, so many trails! Hardly passed a soul. Perfect for a little getaway! Beautiful temples hidden all about."
115,5.0,"It was now one day before we were set to leave Seoul. We decided to join the fad and go hiking at the Bukhansan National Park. It was literally a day of leisure and relaxation. We obviously didn’t make it remotely close to the highest peak of the mountain, but it was a satisfaction in itself to say I was able to hike in another country. I was extremely proud of myself and my group for holding up so well. During the hike you’ll pass many waterways and also a ton of temples scattered throughout the mountain. Be very careful and watch your step.You can buy hiking gear prior to going up the hike."
116,5.0,"we took a 20 minute train ride form the city centre and arrived at the country side (how convenient). From the metro to the initial park it takes 15 -20 minutes walk. Grab some food (kimbab) or some snacks along the way because there are no water stops or snack stations once you start the hike. Once you get to the park, there is a guide who will give you some recommendations based on the level of hike you prefer. The most ""difficult"", common hike people go on, takes about 3.5 hours, which is quite manageable, but its quite uphill and lots of stairs. But once you get to the top of it, its truly breathtaking, and you can spend half a day doing the hike!"
117,5.0,Took a hike up Dobongsan and was truly stunned by the sheer beauty that you can see from up there!! It's a stark contrast from the busy streets of Seoul. A true escape! I would suggest going later in the afternoon to avoid the throngs of hikers though!
118,5.0,"Decided to do something different than shopping in seoul. The climb turns out to be highlight of the trip. Journey there might take awhile, but the breathtaking scenery make up to it."
119,4.0,"I visited this mountain with some friends in January, it was kind of cold outside so it was nice because the moutain climbing made us feel a bit hot and out of breath. It was really great to have lunch on the top of the mountain with the nice view all around. We only hiked for a few hours up to the first peak but other climb for a lot longer."
120,5.0,It was so beautiful! Make sure that you dress appropriately for the hiking. Good shoes. Bring water. Hiking stick would probably make your life easier. It was a lot of fun trying to get up the mountain. My friend and I did not make it all the way up (both out of shape and she's a smoker) But the scenery is beautiful so it was worth doing what we could in the end. I definitely want to make it a goal to come back and make it to the top!
121,5.0,"I'm writing this while waiting for my husband and friends climbing up the peak. I think this is the only time that you really need to hike. The rest of it may be tiring and exhausting but it's very doable. We are not well prepared for this but since we didn't have much to do in Seoul, I suggested my friends do a hiking trip to Bukhansan. Getting here is very easy as I found good information on the park website as well as fromTrip advisor reviews. We took subway line 3 to Gupabal then exit 1 to catch bus 704.Like other reviewers said, we felt intimidating looking at Korean hikers as they were so well prepared for their hikes with proper clothes, walking sticks, gloves. Only one guy in out group wore hiking shoes while the rest of us wore walking shoes. But it turned out that our shoes still managed to get us to the peak. So if you have hiking shoes then wear them but if you don't then don't waste money buying them from those shops along the way to the park entrance. However, the lesson that we learned is to wear light clothes. The hike is long so don't also carry a lot stuffs with you if not necessary. But water is a must so bring as many as you can. Also some snacks if you plan to have a quick pinic at the peak. You'll find amazing spots to do so. Going up took us about 3 hours as we stopped so many times to take pictures and rest. The hike to the peak is 4 km so about half way through it was when we started some rock climbing. The last 1km was harder and very exhausting for me. Don't give up there! Once you got to the peak,your hard work would be paid off. Going down of course was faster and easier. To conclude, I strongly recommend doing this hiking trip if you are in Seoul. I'm very anti athletic and if I could do this then I believe everybody else can too."
122,4.0,"We took up this recommendation from a Korean couple in Jeju - e met them while climbing Hallasan. Got some info from KTO. We took the subway dark blue line 1 to Dobongsan - quite a long ride - last stop too. Exiting the station, we kinda got lost and ended up in the little park next door. Anyways, exit the station and turn right. If there are fellow mountain climbers in the train, just follow them. Go up the stairs to road level and cross the road. Many shops selling mountaineering stuff (clothes, hats, walking sticks, shoes, gloves) line the road. Eating stalls too. Just follow the road until you reach the main entrance - about 15 to 20mins walk. At entrance, get a map and ask the staff which route is best to suit your abilities. As we were first-timers, the staff told us to take the course for Jaeunbong. Some parts were ok, some more challenging esp. this big rock on which the climbers took a lunch break. We tried to continue upwards but were advised by the locals to turn back as our shoes weren't suitable - insufficient grip - and would be too risky. Disappointed, we turned back. Perhaps another time with better shoes. In all, we took about 3+ hours."
123,5.0,"I lived in Suyi-ri near the 4.19 Monument and entered Bukhansan Park at the top of the hill at Academy House (which has a lovely restaurant and coffee bar, BTW!). We hiked all the time, usually in the early morning, sometimes with baby boy in a podaegi on my back. Hikers galore, badminton players by the dozens, yahoo-ers at the top of the mountain waking us up a bit too early competing with the Buddhist priest next door knocking on the wooden carp a bit too early! Bukhansan pleases at all seasons!"
124,4.0,"The National Park website is right on.  Taking bus 34 or 704 from exit 1 of Gupadol (line 3).  That takes about 10min.  There are a bunch of hiking shops in case you need to change gear some what.  The park ranger office is helpful.  Maps are for sale @ 1000 won each.  BE VERY CAREFUL that the time estimate is for one way.  So going up to Baegundae takes 2.5hrs, but it will take another 2hrs to come down.  The rating is some thing subjective.  The web site says it is ""C"" - relatively not difficult, but certainly, if you wear sneakers, you will find it very challenging (sections of it require the use of hands on steel cables)."
125,5.0,"Baegundae is the highest peak.  Start at Doseonsa (Doseon Temple), which is a great temple, and hike up to the peak.  There is a house with beer, makkoli, ramen, and other drinks and snacks near the top.  Great views and it only takes 3-4 hours round trip for moderately paced hikes."
126,4.0,"Love hiking these trails!  The views provide a great break from the cityscape of Seoul.  Two notes for foreigners:  1 . Koreans make hiking into a fashion show -- chances are you're underdressed.  Don't sweat it, move on and enjoy nature (and the fashion show!)  2.  Wear the right shoes -- hiking/mountain climbing shoes. Running/tennis shoes will not suffice and will be problematic."
127,5.0,"I really love this place! it's the best place for you guys who loved hiking with your fellow friends! unfortunately i come here in a group of tour, so i can't hike for long, but still it's quite amazing to see such breath taking view from up there. But becareful! the path have no real safety measures, just some rope and rocky path in some of the places. If u decide to go hiking out there, it will take quite some time, about 1-3 days depending on your skill and ability, but i highly recommend you to try and hike this national park mountain.      Last but not least, I LOVE this place! :D"
128,4.0,"This national park is accessible through multiple routes and being a mountainous area requires you to take a local bus, which isn't easy in Korea.  On the other hand taxis aren't too pricey here so you can always take one.  The mountain isn't too hard to climb and is popular on weekends among Koreans.  There are multiple routes to take so you can do a different climb each time.  Not as great as Seoraksan or Jirisan National parks but easy to do in a day trip from Seoul.  If you have extra time and the weather is good,  the views at the top are quite nice."
129,5.0,Really Nice views from the top! And it is not hard at all to walk up there. One of the best things to do in Seoul for sure. Must do!
130,4.0,"Good place, scenic view is really nice. If you are planning to trek at least 2/3 peaks then try to plan as early as possible in the morning. The views are good if the day is clear instead of foggy. Best season to visit would be autumn..though you can go in any season. Go to dobangsan metro station and the trekking start point is just 1km from the station. Carry water with you..as the trekking will take minimum 3 hrs depending on the track you choose."
131,4.0,"Beautiful mountain even in the winter. My daddy told me it wouldn't be so beautiful at this time a year when there's no snow, but it was a enjoyable hike indeed. I'm not used to hike and it went very well. A little cardio but we also saw people over 70 hiking and small children. Definitely worth a visit. Remember to bring water. Afterwards we went to Soul - a little execlusive coffeeshop in Seoul. Very nice day indeed."
132,3.0,"We read the reviews and went as a group. We went with a group of male and female, but the hill was too intense to climb up to the top. We went to the middle of the hill, but the view there was still breathtaking."
133,5.0,"This place is truly awesome. The views are spectacular. You have the city of seoul on one side and the surrounding mountains on the other. If your in seoul for a couple of weeks or even a week then most definitely take the hike up the mountain. Make sure the day is clear as you will want to see the stunning views on offer. Also make sure you go early...You can actually take a car to the mountain area and there is a place to park your car should you decide to drive to the foot of the mountain. As we don't have the privilege of apple maps/ Google maps or for that matter any navigation app in Korea. A great app called ""waze"" helps a lot, but make sure you look for the information centre of bukhansan mountain as there are many points to start your hiking. Happy hiking people and keep safe"
134,4.0,Yes the views are amazing and breathtaking and the trip itself will be equally breathtaking to as you will be dying for breath in no time out of all the exhaustive trekking required of the place. The place is clean and well organized and beautiful but the trek through the park is very demanding and cannot be done if you have been a little back on your fitness regime. The place is also crazy crowded and attracts a lot of visitors.
135,5.0,"Visited on Thursday September 25 - We were fortunate to be in Seoul during a week with fantastic weather and relatively clear skies. This trip was rather last minute so in my limited time for research, it was difficult to find much information about the best way to access Bukhansan National Park and the trails available. Glad to see that seems to be changing!There's a thread on the 'Difficulty, elevation gain on Bukhansan Hiking Courses' on TripAdvisor and one of the posts suggests going to Dobongsan Station to access the park. We did so, and simply followed a few hikers to the park entrance (~15 minute walk). A very enthusiastic park ranger welcomed us and provided us with a map and a suggested course.We began at the Dobong Park Information Center, and followed the trail to the Seongdowon Temple and then on to the flat rock face of Madangbawi before the final stretch to Jaunbong (Dobongsan Peak). The view was breathtaking. The last bit to this peak is along a very rocky incline that involves you hauling yourself up using the metal rails. I bailed at this point but my friend continued to the top for an even more stunning view. The park ranger suggested the round trip would take about 3.5 hours; it took us 4.5. Definitely an afternoon well spent - make sure you bring a water bottle and some snacks in a backpack. You'll want free hands as you scramble around the rockier parts of the trail."
136,5.0,"Really worth to spend half a day just outside Seoul, if you like hiking, nature and don't scared of a little adventure with Mother Nature. I don't have to tell anything about the track and view, others did that already in detail. But I can advice and confirm some other things...Easiest way is indeed to take the underground to Suyu station (blue line). Go out at exit #3 or #6 and wait for bus #120. Quickest way to the foot of the hill. Cost you 1000 Won p.p. and sit all the way till the last stop (bus station). Opposite of this bus station is a small shop. Definitely recommend to buy here a pair of cheap gloves. They were really useful during the climb to grab the (metal) cable on some stiff parts of the trip. Wait for the shuttle bus that will leave left from the small shop / opposite bus station, get in and pay again 1000 Wan p.p. when you get off on the parking lot of the temple. You can also walk up to the temple. We walked down when we came back. Takes around 25 minutes.Visit the temple first if you like this kind of cultural monuments. I thought it was really impressive. Get afterwards back to the parking lot and follow the signs to the peak. I was surprised about the number of toilets that are placed (and kept clean) on the way to the top. So don't worry about that. Bring enough food and drinks with you for half a day or buy this at the small shop near the bus station. You don't need hiking shoes to make it to the top, though it makes it easier. But if you didn't bring them with you, don't worry. I completed this challenge on my Asics running shoes. Just make sure that you hold the cable and carefully place your steps. Watch out for slippery parts and enjoy this active attraction just outside Seoul! It took us around 3 hours to go up and down starting from the parking lot at the temple.And indeed, after half a day trekking eat some ""chicken and beer"" at this nice local restaurant. It's 50 meters up the opposite site from the bus station."
137,5.0,"Staying only for 4 days in Seoul during the peak autumn season, I cannot experience the autumn foliage in the major mountains of Korea as it is very far. My friend and I chose Bukhansan instead as it is just around Seoul (Gireum Station [Subway Line 4], Exit 3. Take Bus 110B or 143, and get off at the last bus stop.)As we stepped out of the bus, we were very excited about climbing - even attempting the peak. Too bad, the maps and directions weren't even in English so getting lost here is very easy. Along the way, we took many photos as it's a really really great site to behold. Colors ranging from yellow to orange to red are everywhere and the cool air reminds you that it's autumn.Though we did not reach the peak - 1. we did not dress appropriately 2. it will take too much time to reach the peak for amateurs like us 3. we did not bring any food thinking that the climb won't be hard -, we have seen sooo many beautiful things along the way.If you want to try this out, allocate a whole day for this activity and dress appropriately - starting with the right shoes and thick jackets and bring food and cofee!"
138,5.0,"I scaled the Baegundae peak (tallest at 837m) in 2hours 45minutes, and took 2 hours to come back down. Do not trust the official website when it says ""easy difficulty"".The first 2km+ or so of the trail was fine, relatively flat roads, steps and rocks. Thereafter for 1km, it was a steeper accent (~30 degree elevation average) and you have to use your hands sometimes to climb over rocks. Towards the end, it got really steep (~60 degree) and all you have  is a wire and rope to haul yourself to the very top.Proper hiking shoes with solid grip a must. And bring food to the top for alfresco dining!Getting there: Get off at Gupabal station and follow the crowd (bus 34 or 704)."
139,5.0,"We climbed to BaeGunDae (the highest peak) on an autumn day and it was by hands down, the highlight of our trip to Seoul. The views are absolutely spectacular and the climb is incredibly rewarding. That said, I wanted to write this review as a way of a guide for English speaking people given that I found most of this information on Korean blogs. Hopefully, those of you who are planning to visit will find it helpful to find this in English! - When to go: Avoid weekends. Even during the weekdays, it can get heavily congested near the peak. I am told on weekends, you will be mostly staring the backside of the person in front of you during the entire climb up.- How to get there:Take the train to SuYu station on Line 4. Exit the station via #3 exit, then cross the road to catch bus #120 to DoSunSa temple. It's the final destination. There are two or so other alternative buses but #120 is the most direct and quickest one. You will find yourself at the foot of BukHanSan, once you get off #120 bus at the bus garage. Opposite the bus garage, there is a shuttle bus to the temple parking lot, which costs you 1,000 Won. The shuttle is there for the temple visitors but they will take hikers on weekdays. It departs every half an hour or so. If you choose not to take the bus to the temple parking lot, it's about 30mins hike up from here. - Route: From the temple parking lot, the route up to BaeGunDae is about 1hr 45mins. The last 0.6km is a quite a challenge, climbing up the surfaces of giant boulders that make up BaeGunDae. As novice climbers, we relied heavily on the metal ropes to aid us. Cycling gloves would've come in handy at this point, as we pulled ourselves up whilst testing our upper body strength! On the way down, we took the route via YongAmMun and it was a much less crowded and shaded walk with fantastic views. It will bring you down via DoSunSa temple, which is a beautiful and historic temple worth a visit after your day's climb. - Difficulty: Our friends were more experienced hikers but even one of them struggled a little bit towards the end. As reasonably fit 31 year old novice climbers, we were fine to climb it but we found it quite hairy at times. I wouldn't recommend it for my parents (who are 60) or children, but to be fair - most of the locals were much older than us and they climbed it with grace and ease! - Make sure: You pack a pair of hiking boots (our friend who had trainers found the surfaces too slippery at times) and a camera for when you get up to the top! - Additional tip: Take a packed lunch and plenty of water. Locals take hot water in a flask for their cup noodles or Californian roll (KimBap). There is small canteen just before you start the last 0.6km climb but it would be advisable to take your own food with you. It's worth the weight you carry. Also, there are couple of toilets on the way up but they are mostly holes in the ground, so something to be aware of for those of you with weak stomach! Lastly, you should totally reward yourself with chicken and beer after your climb near the bus stop. The chicken was super tasty and the cold beer hit the spot after a long day's climb."
140,5.0,"I am in love with this park. You can spend an entire day here and still have new stuff to discover. It's connected to Dobongsan Mt so you can literally enjoy the peaks and pleasant views. It's an excellent place to blend in with the Korean population and experience their culture. If you're nice, you might even try some rice wine as the Koreans are very courteous to foreigners. If you are muscular in the least bit, the Koreans will make you feel like a bodybuilder - it's rather pleasant. I have no dislikes about this park. It's literally a gem and you can locate it by train via Dobongsan. It is two stops after Uijeongbu."
141,5.0,"This is a must do park. It has different levels of hiking and don't let the people with walking stick and climbing gear discourage you. Me and my 5 friends climbed to the peak in 3 hours and 1 friend has bad knees and could still do it on the difficult trail. (no gear) The view is worth it and I have never seen a trail so clean with so many people, it was amazing. There are harder trails for the extremist but we are not we were just going for a hike. Make sure you bring lots of water and snacks there is no where to buy any once you are on the trails."
142,3.0,"I went in summer with a good friend who drives, and he drove me up there to the entrance, and we then walked there for a while around the front of that park. On the whole, as a drive, it was good but I think that it would be better if you plan a real afternoon hike with friends in the cooler months of fall, because without hiking gear, and being dressed inappropriately in the warm summer(with tee shirt and jeans), we could not walk very far. The view was actually not as spectacular as I imagined. All in all, get ready mentally for the hike, and do not just go with a friend who has a rather limited view of mountain viewing as driving around its edges."
143,5.0,"Every Korea visitor should pay homage to the great mountains that shaped the history and the people of this beautiful peninsula like few other elements in their long history (5000 years + as they Tourist board contents will kindly remind you repeatedly). There are beautiful and more stunning, and challenging options for hikers across the land but if you are strapped for time or Seoul-bound, Bukhasan National Park in the north of the megalopolis is the place to go. Easily accessible via the city’s brilliant Metro and bus system it only takes about 20 mins from Tourist hub Insadong to get to the mountains and another 10 minutes bus ride to the actual park itself. Once there, stock up in the local store for food and drinks if you haven’t done so before and attempt to hike up Baekundae (836m) and get ready for an amazing hike. Korean’s always are well prepared for hiking, sporting the latest kit and equipment and unless your very sporty and/or an avid hiker yourself you will find yourself overtaken by groups of Ajumanis (elderly ladies) who sprint up the mountain with astonishing speed and stamina that will put most to shame. The hike is not difficult at all but city dwellers will find it mildly challenging but promises beautiful country side and scenery (and the chance to see the birth of a river from few dew drops at the top of the mountain until it becomes a powerful stream in the valley before joining the mighty Han river. Leave at least 3 hours to hike (with breaks) and 3 hours for returns (you will be exhausted). Best time to set off is later afternoon in summer and autumn to make the most of the beautiful scenery. The tracks are well sign-posted and in case you do get lost or need directions just to be sure there a plenty of Koreans about to help you. We hiked up in the afternoon and miscalculated time, reaching the peak for a most stunning sunset but with very little day light left to reach the bottom of the mountain again. Luckily we bumped into a helpful Korean who told us to follow him and his massive torchlight all the way down to the valley again."
144,5.0,"If you are into nature while in Seoul, nothing beats Bukhansan Park. Although I did not go all the way up, my intention was to just enjoy the trip, I did indeed appreciate the four hours or so “walk” uphill and then down with my four undergraduate students. More like hiking. And I admire the Korean men and women, some older than I am (or they looked it) taking the challenge – it was a challenging walk. Most of them (looking fit) came prepared with walking sticks to assist in the steep climb up and down. There are stone slabs and rock steps but even with proper shoes, these can be quite dangerous if one is not careful. Though they were fit enough, my students didn’t seem the type to have gone there if I had not insisted – young people they are.  The view of Seoul from up there was beautiful, I could even spot Namsan Tower. I spotted various kinds of mushrooms and a squirrel-half-eaten pine fruit which I thought was a pineapple from afar as the animal was escaping with it – among other things. The paths were shaded and  the atmosphere was not hot nor cool. Bring food and drinks so that you can stop and eat/drink while you catch your breath or/and relax. We came across an old castle gate. We entered by the entrance closest to the Kookmin University by taking a bus, and we came down somewhere where there was a bus right at the foot of the park to take us to the next metro station. If you had walked out further from the exit you would have found restaurants and souvenir shops. Past visitors warned of crowds during weekends – we went on a Friday morning and we had a quiet walk in Bukhansan Park – well aside from our chatters."
145,5.0,Plenty of hikes for all ages and abilities.  Most hikes start and finish near food stalls.   Good public transport links.
146,5.0,"I went on this hike with family members with ages ranging from 10-69.  It was an attractive hiking setting with multiple different paths. The park rangers were very helpful and able to suggest routes to take.  The hiking path our group took included a Buddhist temple and then to the Dobongsan peak.  For the youngest and the oldest, they hiked up to the temple and looked around and had a small picnic.  For the rest of us, we went up too the peak.  This was a challenging hike and is best done with hiking shoes (we all had sneakers).  The end of the hike involves a steep climb that require holding onto poles and/or ropes.  It was worth the hike to get to a beautiful view of Seoul.  Hint:  Make sure to bring plenty of water and a snack.  Better to have hiking shoes.  Wear sun block.  The bathrooms are old-fashioned/non-Western style."
147,5.0,"This is one of the best outdoor activities in Seoul.  The views along the mountain trails, as well as the cityscape from the top, are breathtaking.  I highly recommend finding a Korean friend who is familiar with some of the lesser known trails.  If you can, please go in the early morning so that you can beat the masses.  You will still pass by plenty of older men and women, but it won't be a continuous line of people.  Wear good hiking or trail running shoes.  Pack plenty of water and some kimbap rolls, and you'll be set for brunch at the top! Once you reach the bottom, treat yourself for an afternoon pajeon and makgeolli.  Perfect!"
148,5.0,"Lovely walk, took the metro Gupabal and the bus to Sanseong (get off when everyone does) to walk up to Baekundae (the highest peak). The walk was gorgeous and the view at the end was stunning, lots of people making the route especially at the end so expect that. Also the Koreans love their hiking kit, don't be too put off you can do it in 'sports kit' providing you take all the necessary water etc.The first 3km are quite easy but definitely uphill the last 1-2km becomes more of a natural staircase and the very last stretch is walking up the rocks, there is a wire barrier however this would be very scary for someone who had a big fear of heights or vertigo."
149,5.0,"great place for a day trek.took a taxi from heoungdae with 3 other people to main entrance,was about 16000 won,took about 2.5 hrs to get up to the highest peak with a few breaks and a long stop (maybe 30 mins) at the top to admire the views and some food.the last 300m is almost a climb,its still pretty easy though and is well worth the hike,walking back down the otherside and back into the little town at the bottom with a bus station took about 1.5 hrs.so 4.5 hrs all up,easily done in a day.there is a few toilet stops along the way and heading down the other side had a little shop/cabin with the basics.there is some slippery spots on the trail so runners or hiking shoes are recommended .all in all a great day and the taxi back to heoungdae was about 21000 won as it was coming into peak hr."
150,5.0,"Bukhansan National Park was a pleasant discovery for me when I visited Seoul recently. Normally I do not seek out a nature day out when I go to a metropolis like Seoul, but this national park was literally in Seoul so I could not resist. About a 20-minute drive from downtown takes you to the park entrance. From there you get to the park office where the very helpful park ranger is stationed, then you can get onto one of the several hiking trails right away. The signboards here were clear and informative.I took probably the easiest route and only halfway at that because I had not come physically prepared for serious hiking. Along the way, there was a small stream and really lush springtime forest nature. What surprised me was the number of seniors walking the trails with ease. I reckon they must walk them everyday to be so fit. It was funny to see them decked out in full hiking gear, with professional walking sticks and many with a CD player strapped on blaring out Korean music.I imagine many foreigners would miss Bukhansan National Park due to the shopping and tons of activities in the city. However, if you are staying longer in Seoul or a repeat visitor like I was, this park is well worth checking out for a slow life day."
151,5.0,"If you are in South Korea and want to have a memorable trip, then this is a must visit place. Awesome environment, great view, you will know only once you are there.Can be reached easily after you get down at Dobongsan Metro station. Just cross the hiking village and there is the entrance.Minimum 4 hours of visit."
152,5.0,"I frequently visit Seoul on business and on one weekend I hiked Bukhansan with my colleagues.  This is a serious hike during the summer to the summit peak and back down.  I was impressed by beautiful mountain vista, bird eye view of Seoul city skyline and a temple.  We didn't know and we were totally unprepared for the hike.  Each person in our group hand carried 2 bottles of drinking water thinking, if we need it, we can buy additional water along the trail to summit.  There is no store and we quickly ran out of water climbing up the mountain.  Korean are gracious and very kind people.  Total strangers were smiling and offering to share their water, fruits and some even invited us to the picnic.  We politely declined picnic but glad to accept the water.  We were totally blown away by their generosity.  I highly recommend Bukhans and I plan to do hike again soon but during the spring or fall season when it is cooler.   The mountain is spotless clean in spite of numerous groups having picnics, I saw most hikers carrying back down their own trash.  We need to replicate the same in the USA."
153,4.0,"this mountain was good in its vicinity within the city, it was little inconvenient in that it had no food stall inbetween the halfway through mountain climbing like water or simple food, like Gimbap or ice-cream especially in summer."
154,5.0,The park is easily accessible right next to Seoul. The views are also really awesome on clear days. It can be a bit packed in some areas as it is right next to the city and Koreans do love hiking. There is some good climbing on the granite peaks too. You have to be patient with the amount of people that you'll most likely encounter. Don't expect to be the only people out in the mountains.
155,5.0,"It was an amazing experience to climb Bukhansan mountain. from the downtown in Seoul, it takes about just 30~40minutes to get here. On the peak of Bukhansan, very nice Seoul view you can enjoy."
156,5.0,"Bukhansan is an amazing place. You could go every single weekend and hike different areas at different skill levels. Some of the trails include rope climbing and pulling yourself up steep areas via steel rails, so be aware of that before going. It caught us by surprise when we went expecting a casual hike as opposed to climbing. The park is easily an all day experience with rest areas and some vending machines at the base of the park."
157,5.0,The humidity when I was here was crushing. The scenery was wonderful and we met many smiling and happy Koreans who were happy to help us find our way.
158,4.0,"Bukhansan Mt consist of few trails and I did the Baegundae Peak Trail, it is a really easy and refreshing trail, the view is nice, a waterfall on the mid hike is also a good spot for a short breather. It's only take me 1 hour and 45minutes up, and its definitely stunning. For those who want to have a good time at the peak to enjoy the view of Seoul, do the hike early in the morning, because it will be a little bit crowded started from 10 in the morning."
159,5.0,"I have hiked in Sorak-San, Cheju-do and other national parks - all stunning. But I regret that it has taken me fifteen years of visiting Korea to finally venture 30minutes out of Seoul to experience this gem of a park. The English version of the National Park website has plenty of good information. Note that even in the dead of winter the trails will be crowded so rise early to beat the rush and enjoy the early light of day. The Baekundae Peak is the highest pinnacle and a breathtaking panoramic view of the park and greater Seoul. Take the No 3 Metro to Gubapal Station and then the 704 bus to the park entrance. It is a proper work out scaling the top but well worth the effort. I recommend the restaurant ""Mansukjang"" at the base for a very memorable meal. Built as an old style Korean house, it overlooks the mountain range in the distance and sits over the river. Excellent food."
160,5.0,very beautiful views and the weather is fine ( though it is -1 that day ) ... anyway i did enjoy the honey pen cake up there on that mountain small food court. very cute  :)
161,5.0,"There are numerous trails, from those for walkers to trails for the extreme mountain climber. Always great views and something to see the mountains in this range are great in any season."
162,5.0,"Wow... this park is beautiful! It is defo worth the hike and the effort! If you go to the peak then you'll be faced with the most amazing views!Getting there is rather confusing because everything is in Korean. You just need to get directions to one of the Metro stops that will link you to a bus that will go there. Once you get off the metro, best bet is to ask someone which bus to take, or just follow the hundreds of Koreans that will be going there."

We tackled the highest peak in the park: Baegundae Peak. It is a challenging trail but very safe with railings and ropes."
164,5.0,Was an excellent  destination to hike and walk. Select a side trail and it is possible to get away from the crowd. We did a Wednesday hike and it was tremendous and quiet other than right nearthe entrance area.
165,4.0,"My friends and I took the subway to Dobongsan station, crossed the road and followed the path of hiking gear stalls and local eateries all the way to the rangers office.  We asked the stall keepers and they pointed the way to the entrance.  There were gloves, sticks, hiking clothes of all budget available.  I think it's really worth buying some while you are in Seoul.  Where else can one get a long sleeve, colourful hiking shirt at 10,000 won, gloves at 3000 won and neon arm protectors at 3000 won?  The Koreans were very well prepared for hiking. All dressed up and lots of gear.  The higher end hiking shops are near the rangers office.  Lonely Planet calls the office a ""ticket office"" but we don't need to pay to hike.   At the rangers office, we were helped by the ranger who spoke English to find an easy route to a nearby peak called Uiam.  See photo.  We started with paved roads until we came to lots of rocks, steps etc.  Along the way, there were streams, temples, bridges and plenty of clambering over rocks.  There were also toilets so not to worry.  Buy snacks, fruits, drinks along the walk from the subway to the entrance so you can have a picnic where ever you wish, including near the stream.  We bought coffee, mandarin oranges and grapes to enjoy.  Lots of middle aged Koreans were enjoying themselves this way, dipping feet into the streams.  When we were about 200 m from Uiam, a couple advised us not to go further as we were not wearing proper hiking shoes and gestured to us that it was slippery.  We took their advice and came down.  The short exercise took us about 1.5 - 2 hours.      As we came down from Bukhansan, we ate at the restaurants which served grilled fish, birds etc.  The fish was delicious but lots of bones.  The birds were too tiny to enjoy.  Altogether, it was a fun and doable hike for novices like me and a wonderful break from hectic shopping and feasting in Seoul."
166,5.0,"This place is really gorgeous, we went up from Bukhansanseong information center to Bohyenbong peak, than down on a shorter way the otherside, passed next to temple, left our worries behind at rocks. I found it quite challenging and not what I expected in terms of level of difficulty, I was lucky to wear hiking shoes, but my friend wore gym shoes and was saved only by his level of fitness. You need a good grip to be comfortable and feel safe on the rocks.This is an amazing place, but it's not an easy walk in the forest, you do get to climb, hold on to rope and struggle towards the end especially. But in the end it all worth it, and not only in the end but all the way, if you give yourself time to look around, nature will pay you for all your sweat. We went on Saturday and it was crowded, but I didn't mind, you see lovely Korean people of all ages; as you go up they say something like ""Hyte!"" I didn't have a clue what it means, but it keeps you going and smiling and it feels like ""Go on!"", ""You can do it!"", ""Keep walking!""My recommendation would be to take water, something to munch on and good shoes, can't stress enough on this, does half the job, if you have gloves and towel as well, better for you. Enjoy the lovely view of Seoul from the mountain top!!"
167,4.0,"Do you like hiking? Doesn't matter. I don't, but I still made my way to the top and the work paid off with some excellent views of the city.Maybe not the best idea if you think that you are going to be getting away from the city, because 1000's of locals also have the same idea and will be joining you on your way to the top and you might even find that it's a little crowded at the top when everyone is having a picnic. Still, a pretty cool way to see the locals is by going for a hike. Tip: bring your camera and buy some snacks at the bottom for when you get to the top."
168,5.0,"Definitely one of the highlights of our Korea trip!Our first hiking experience and it was great to soak in the beautiful nature and the scenery from the top was gorgeous.The hiking trails are clearly marked out and there are trails of varying difficulty to suit you.The mountain isnt too far from the city centre so it is quite easy to fit it into your plans.Do prepare a set of comfortable attire to hike in, hiking in tight jeans was quite tiresome. And start your hike early as night hikes are not allowed.We started at 4pm and had to pretty much rush our way to the top."
169,5.0,"You will never believe you are inside Seoul. Take a subway to Dobongsan Station (Lines 1 and 7) and it is obvious where the hiking is. Some of the trails have ropes or even steel cables to hang on to, they are so steep. Others are gentle slopes up mountain streams. Be prepared for crowds on the weekend!"
170,5.0,"Along with Gwanaksan in the South, Bukhansan in the North is one of the best places to hike. TO get to the top takes a few hours, so pack a lunch and lots of water. Also, if you can go with a hiking group it is always nice as they can show you some of the rock features, guide you to the trail head, and be nice people to share a hike with. I don't hike on Bukhansan that much, but I do on Gwanaksan, and Korean mountains often have lots of intertwining trails. I would suggest getting the lay of the land first, or having a GPS, but I would highly recommend taking secondary trails over primary trails as the primary trails are often overcrowded, particularly on the weekend. On the minor trails you can hike for hours without seeing many people, and the people you do see are usually small groups and not mega groups that create traffic jams."
171,5.0,"we went on a sunday morning and, despite the cold (it snowed heavily the night before), we saw many hikers along the way. i'm not an experienced hiker but bukhansan was quite manageable, just that it gets a bit steeper closer to the peak. we planned to hike to baegundae peak but got lost along the way, switched to wonhyobong peak. thankfully there were signs along the way. the scenery is amazing, especially with all those snow - felt like we were in a winter wonderland. it's a good 3 to 4 hours hike, do bring along some food and drinks. otherwise, there are shops at the foot of the mountain where you can grab coffee and some snacks after the hike. if you're intending to hike in winter prepare crampons and trekking poles, they will really come in useful.directions: get off at exit 1 of Gupabal station and you'll see many people at the bus stop. take bus 704. announcements are made in both korean and english. it's highly unlikely you'll get lost - get off at the stop where majority of the folks carrying hiking gears alight (koreans are well-prepared hikers!)."
172,4.0,Started the trip with a taxi ride to Waryong Park. The walk took a total of 2plus hours at a comfortable pace but due to the ups and downs of the fortress will not recommend for those with weak knees. The walk brings you away from the hectic pace of Seoul city while technically still in the middle of the city. Great view of Seoul city and the hills around it.
173,4.0,So you're in Seoul and you think you want to get some fresh air and exercise.  Or maybe you're decked out in North Face gear and think it's time to put it to good use.  Bukhansan is a great mountain for all levels of hikers.  There are different trails and places to stop for rest along the way.  The other hikers are very friendly as well.
174,5.0,Bukhansan is one of the nomal mountains that are located in near Seoul.Korea have many verity beautiful mountains.....It's a pitty that only few visitor hike mountain.Korea are composed with territory of 70% mountainous region.I hope that many visitor vist Korea inland mountains.
