1,4.0,"C ( 17.10.26 ) This university was located in downtown, so the ground was not bigger than I think. There was good for stroll with cozy atmosphere. There had modern and Gothic building, so the harmony was good to me."
2,4.0,"I visited at during week-end. Easy to access, you can walk, visit main building (underground level) students working, eating, some family visiting university with their kids, no stress, good place to be calm. It is not touristic place but a heritage of education."
3,3.0,I was on this capmus from June to August of 2015 for the International Summer campus. I stayed at Cj international house on campus. The dorm is awesome. Great ac for the summer weather.Overall the campus is huge with a lot of hills.  It totally do able just go up the back way by Frontier house.The program there is good for experience but I wouldnt recommend the learning korean in six weeks especially if you are a beginner. The food on campus is so so. However there are alot of good places around campus to eat and also campus. I recommend those.
4,5.0,Was doing a talk at the school.  Was thoroughly impressed by the school and grounds. Was like an impressive English University ground.  Beautiful architecture and facilities.
