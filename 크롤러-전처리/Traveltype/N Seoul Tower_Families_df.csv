0,4.0,"Well worth the time and it offers a great view of the city. There is plenty of merch to buy, and of you get hungry there see restaurants here as well. Of you visit during winter you should dress warm since it could get pretty windy up here. It is easy to get here by bus and the entrence fee is pretty cheap."
1,5.0,"Located on Namsan mountain in central Seoul, it's easy to get to. Just after dusk provides breathtaking views. You need to take the cable car up the plaza area. Here you will find lots of attraction like the ""love locks"" something similar to Paris, wishing pond, various observatory decks, food court, museum's and the entrance to the observatory tower itself which boasts of panoramic views of the city of Seoul. One of Seoul's must visit attractions."
2,5.0,My family and I vacationed in Seoul for New year's Eve. We stayed at the millenium Hilton in front of Seoul station. we didn't know what to do for New year's Eve countdown. So we decided to climb the mountain directly in front of the millenium Hilton. At The summit is Seoul tower. From which you can see the New year's Eve fireworks from down below. The temperature was about minus 8 degrees Celsius. We bundled up around 11 p.m. and started up. The hike was very lovely. As you hike up you can see a beautiful a 360 view of the city of Seoul at night. It's not a hard hike. And there are art installations along the way. Including a strange love heart lock it installation. Apparently you can buy love heart lockets and write a message and lock it around these fences and other art installations along the mountain. At the top of the mountain there are cafes and gift shops. You can purchase tickets to go in to Seoul tower. We did not do that. Instead We got some hot chocolate and coffees and celebrated 2020 watching the fireworks from down below. The fireworks were very small from our vantage point and not that impressive. but overall it was a beautiful hike and an absolutely fantastic way to ring in the New year. It started to snow along the way as well but that made it all the more romantic and special. My teenage daughter took many pictures. We walked around with our hot drinks looked around the gift shops and then made our way back down as we started to feel the chill. I highly recommend this hike. I could not have imagined a better New year's Eve . It was perfect
3,5.0,"It was really an amazing view at night.  Although it was -1°c, but it was nice to see.  The place had recreation for the young ones & had alot of food plc too."
4,4.0,Firstly do not trust Google maps direction to get to the tower. It requires you to alight at a quiet bus stop n walk up aong walk up a hill.Follow the directions on the website. It's more reliable.  The tower deck is not that big but it does provide you with a typical city view that must towers provide. Do check out the toilets. It's a place where you can relieve yourself while admiring a city view.
5,5.0,Visited the observatory by cable car. The cable car is a short walk from myeongdong train station. The cable car brings you to the walkway of locks where one can continue to the tower. At night one can see the bright lights of Seoul as well as the numerous vehicles coming in and out. There are some retail and ding establishments at the retail area of the tower.
6,4.0,On our last day in Seoul we decided it was now or never. So we headed to the cable car station to catch it up to the tower. I was quite disappointed as they packed us in there was no room. The lady next to me started to shove me out of her way just so she could see out the window like she was more important I think not. I thought this was very rude we are all there on a holiday to enjoy it why treat other people like this I really don’t see the point. We got to the bottom of the tower we seen all the colourful padlocks they were very interesting to some photos but made the choice not to go up as visibility was rather poor. This ended up being the right choice because when we came back down. We found a nice Korean BBQ place for lunch. By the time we came out of there it was raining and you could hardly see the tower. It was a real shame the weather wasn’t with us on this day but some things can’t be helped.
7,2.0,"If you are planning to go to the observatory, mind the weather conditions as they do not have any notice about the visibility. They did not offer to give a refund or to make it valid for another day. Very disappointed"
8,5.0,"If you are a fan of Kdrama, the night scene at N Seoul Tower definitely did not disappoint. The cable car ride was pleasant and orderly.  There are multiple inexpensive dining options by the tower. The public space to view the night scene at the foot of the tower was huge so even on crowded days, it did not feel claustrophobic. It was a pleasant place to spend a nice evening."
9,4.0,A quintessential tourist stop in the outskirts of Seoul. We did not go up the tower. Just hung around the base area and took in the scenic beauty. There are locks for sale for the lovebirds to place on the fences. A lovely view of the city from the top of the hill.
10,5.0,"Went during the day and Took a long walk up from Myeongdong, tiring as it's up slope. Ideal to walk from Shinsegae department store and take the slanted elevator up to the cable care point. View is wonderful from the top and super cold during winter. Some restaurant and shops, best for scenery viewing. So many love locks around."
11,3.0,Going by public transport with old folks is not convenience as you have to walk up the hill to reach the Namsam cable car centre.
12,4.0,"This place have a nice bird-eye view of seoul. You can still see them without going up to the main tower. There is a place for the 'locks' where friends, lovers and family expressed themselves by placing a padlocks, phone covers there. Take care because the slope is quite steep getting up. Basically its good for photo taking."
13,4.0,Took bus 6011 from Namdaemun Market. Beautiful walk for those who likes to stroll up on foot but require lots of stamina.Need to pay to go up further to the tower. We just checked out the six storeys at the base of the tower. You can shops and convenience store here. Lots of shiny locks at level T1 where lovers secure their love locks.Go around 5pm to catch both sunset and night view.
14,4.0,On my Third Day in Seoul I walked up Namsan Hill. Beautiful walk with all the tree turning red yellow and orange. On the 5th Day went up using the cable car. It is a must visit. Enjoy the view of Seoul from there. Only sour point was when i bought coffee from Twosome Place i was not allowed to drink in the Burger Restaurant where my daughters was having their Hotdog. Too rigid in my opinion.
15,5.0,We walked up to the Namsan Park Cable Car Station. Bought one-way cable car ticket (instead of round trip) to N Seoul Tower.The tower offers gorgeous city views. Many food outlets there too.Thereafter we took a leisurely slow walk all the way down to the base of the hill and took many many gorgeous photos of the beautiful autumn foliage.
16,5.0,"Namsan Seoul Tower, serve as radio tower and also a tourism spot. It is near Myeongdong, walking distance is around 15-20 mins depend on your paces. Reachable by bus and cable car. Excellent views! Great experience! Don’t go on weekend! The queue is super long!!!Food is limited choices. Can be extreme cold in winter.Prepare a love lock if you want to lock one."
17,4.0,"There is a cable car ride that's brings you up to the hills and back but I would suggest walking up the footpath and taking the cable car back. It takes about 15-20 mins depending on your fitness level but the view is pretty great ...overlooks the city and offers opportunities for photo taking.Once you are up at the tower, there are numerous food options and I highly recommend the Korean udon restaurant which offers great views too. Other choices include a burger joint, Italian food and a grill on the highest floor of the Seoul Tower. There are usually cultural performances which features drumming and some martial arts by the open space near the ticket booth.The observatory is quite good but it was a hazy day when I visited with my family so don't expect to take nice shots from up there. Overall a nice experience and one of the sights to check out in Seoul. Oh yeah...actually try walking up from the pathway near Exit 2 of Myeongdong station. There are a number of nice cafes and quaint shops along the way."
18,5.0,"N Seoul Tower was on our list during our travel.Usually people recommend to go Seoul tower during evenings to watch City's neon lights.But due to time constraint,we went there in the morning.We took cab till foot of the hill.From there we chave chosen Hiking.You can also go through cable car but we captured many awesome pics during our hike.It was easy and took around 1 hour for us to reach there.We just went to foot of the tower and returned through cable car as it was difficut for my 4 yr old son to hike down.Pricing is as below₩7000/pax- 1way₩4500/child-1 way₩9500/pax-2way₩6500/child-2way"
19,5.0,"Perched on a hill accessible only by a town bus or the cable car, this provides a great view of the city of Seoul!We went by cable car - and it was easy and fuss free.  Climbing up the stairs you’d be greeted by a stall selling snacks.  Try out the soup fish cakes... divine especially in cold weather.   A little further up you will see the locks and love messages...  there the Hawkeyed would Spy “abandoned” phone cases but these have handwritten (presumably love) notes scrawled in permanent ink... we didn’t get a chance to do this ☺️.  Perhaps next round! We purposely chose to go up later in the day just to see Seoul’s night light.  If you are the sort who’d like to spot landmarks, please go before sundown.  Layout is very much like the observatory tower in Shanghai though!  A good experience all in all!"
20,4.0,"We brought an infant in stroller and it was smooth to go to the tower through the cable car. However, as we had reserved ticket to the top of observation there was no way for ppl with stroller and ppl said it was repaired so the only way we had to use the stairs which was ridiculous and we had to miss the opportunity and the ticket to go to the top."
21,5.0,Cool weather and very nice scenery at night at the top of the tower.There is a Japanese restaurant which serve nice and delicious foods too.
22,5.0,We stopped here as part of the hop on/hop off tour so the cable car and trip to the top was included. I recommend doing all of it! The views were stunning. We travelled with a toddler and she also loved it.
23,4.0,The views from the tower were excellent on a bright sunny autumn day.... ! The elevator ride took less tha  15 seconds to the top. There is also a Hello Kitty outlet and walkabout at the lower level...
24,5.0,Can enjoy beautuful whole seoul city view!recommend for evening time . but verrryyyyy long waiting line for cable car ticket(almost one hour).
25,4.0,"More than the tower itself, how to get to the top is the most interesting part. Based on what you prefer, you can do a 3.5 K rolling hill walk, combination of flat walk with some decent hikes - some through steps and rest through single lane path, series of steps all the way to the top or take the cable car to the top. If you are staying nearby, good area to go for a morning walk or a run"
26,4.0,My family enjoyed going up on the tower and seeing the views and the also the interesting exhibits inside the tower. My kids particularly liked the cable car that took us up to the tower and also the shows outside the Tower. They had a sword show and a talent show.
27,5.0,Best is go there in the night.  And I alway stay at Myeongdong area and make sure that my hostel or guesthouse can see N Seoul tower view :)
28,4.0,"Nice walk up the hill. Good scenary. Visit the Ryan cheese ride, taking cute bear photos. and Hello Kitty Island also. Lots of peoples."
29,4.0,"Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions.  Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations - this is easy and convenient. The tower now has many little shops, restaurants, coffee shops... plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower. This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when it’s not worth the $$ to go up the tower.  Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences (not sure what this is all about)... visit the hello kitty island, etc. a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular - they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor.  On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing, pretty amazing views on a clear day, and (of course) shops to buy snacks and souvenirs. It’s been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower. It was a nice experience however, limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children.  Overall a good place to visit, better on a clear day, wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability. Something for everyone at the tower  - I would go again and absolutely bring friends/family when they come to visit."
30,5.0,Too bad that we were not able to go inside the tower itself only a distance from it since it was too cold. We were just at a village tourist attraction down below. It looks nice from afar.
31,3.0,"There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower, by cable car or to hike up. My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour. It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise 😂😂 N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! 😍 its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there’s nothing much to do."
32,4.0,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. ---------------------------------When to go:So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ----------------------------How to get there:We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up. I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. -----------------------Seoul tower Park:So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops.---------------------------Seoul towerThe tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like. There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice. I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. -------------------Getting down:When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. ---------------------Worth it? I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views. Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. ---------Protip:For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff."
33,5.0,"Not to be missed for korean drama enthusiasts! This famous landmark is seen in a lot of kdramas. It is great for a lovely stroll, date night, and sightseeing. Best to go just before sunset during the summer season to avoid the heat and to have a great sunset view. If using the cable car to get to the namsan tower grounds, get a roundtrip ticket as this will be cheaper rather than getting a one way ticket going up and then deciding to get another one way ticket on the way down. You could, if you’re trying to save money. But you would probably be too tired to hike down that you’re most likely going to end up taking the cable car on your way down again anyway. There is a separate ticket to get in to the namsan tower itself. It is not expensive so we did it. I was glad we did, as it gave us a 360 degree view of the city. It was really nice, as everything is lit up at night and you could see the view in a very colorful setting."
34,5.0,Great place a must to visit.. kids and adults... been to other observation decks but this was the best.
35,5.0,"In the Namsan area, we visited this site in order to see the city view and were surprised for the better then our expectations. I recommend to go there and use the cable car 🚠 to get there."
36,5.0,"Is a Must! When visiting Seoul, great place to spend the afternoon or the whole evening, shops , restaurants, coffee shops and lots of entertainment"
37,4.0,"We were staying just a short walk from the tower cable car, so we thought we'd go one afternoon.We got there around 16:30 and I was glad we did.The ride in the cable car is reasonably priced, around $10:00 AUD, for a return trip.The longest part of the journey was the 3 flights of snaking passenger line that we waited in.The cable car offers a pretty good view, the car gets loaded to maximum capacity so try and get in first for a good window position. Once up on the tower area, the views of Seoul just keep going.It's very popular with locals, and we saw plenty of local sports teams during the night.Plenty of places to eat, ranging from street cart style, food court to restaurants. There is a padlock area that was supposed to be removed some months ago, but I think there may have been a lot of resistance to that move.  You can still buy padlocks of various prices and write your message of love.It was really nice watching the views change, this time of the year it didn't get dark until after 20:00 hrs.We didn't stand in line for as long to go back."
38,4.0,"The top of the tower shall show you the view of the City of Seoul. You will see the buildings or the ""industrial"" part of the city.If you will go via train (Myeong-dong) you will still need to walk a little bit,uphill. Lot of energy though is needed because it is uphill and the stairs for the cable car. After riding the cable car, you can walk and look at the love locks place. Walking further you'll arrive at the observatory. You will need to have the passes and ride the elevator by then.The place is popular for tourists so expect queueing for cable cars and elevators."
39,5.0,I loved this overall journey of going on gondola n cuming back by foot loved those love locks its beautiful n nice views of city from top of mountain dono why this place have bad reviews kids loved it 9 n 5 years old n its very easily approachable from local bus
40,5.0,We walked from Myeongdong area to the cable car station (20-25 mins) where we took 🚠 (W35000 for 3 adults 1 child) to the tower ground floor. We booked tickets at the Klook apps in advance for entering the tower which are much cheaper. It gave instant confirmation with QR code. We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation. There are some shops and restaurants/eateries at the Tower. It's a popular place and must visit. We spent 3 hours here in late afternoon. I must be back in one autumn as it will be full of maple leaves🍁
41,4.0,N Seoul Observatory Deck showed us an amazing view of Namsan and Seoul. It should be visited by tourist as it is known as one of the top tourist destinations in Seoul.
42,4.0,"My kids enjoyed the N Seoul Tower and the Hello Kitty Island, especially the latter. The only really disappointing thing was that the grand piano did not work! Maybe there should be a restaurant in the Hello Kitty Cafe."
43,4.0,I think it was worth the line and wait to go up to the to. There are lots of fun things to see and do as well. The tram up and down is such a unique experience highly recommend for anyone visiting Seoul
44,4.0,"Glad I visited now as the leaves of the trees are so green..my favorite time to visit is at twilight, the changing of colors outside while I'm up there is really magical"
45,5.0,We had amazing view through N Seoul Tower and I love that you get to choose riding (with fee of course) or going through the stairs
46,4.0,"Nothing much to do up at the observatory level, just enjoy the scenery and have some twosome coffee."
47,5.0,"good experience, top building , good service , good manner , good prepare , fast , quick , beautiful , amazing view"
48,5.0,"I didn’t expect this trip to be so much fun for my children. There were Cartoon characters everywhere which they loved to spot. There was a Cablecar ride to the top (not as hot as I thought it was going to be inside the plastic box full of tourists) they have bars/restaurants/ice cream parlours and the view is stunning on a clear day.  The cost doesn’t get you to the top which I do find disappointing. You have to pay an additional cost of 11,200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the “top”. 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind. They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top. The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring. Taxis and busses are at the entrance if you don’t want to walk back to your apt.  It didn’t feel packed with the amount of people actually up there.  There is an amusement arcade half way which entertains the kids no end."
49,5.0,"It’s one of the most famous spot in Seoul - must visit.We walked from the Namsangol Hanok Village, fresh atmosphere, nice weather. We really like it.It only can be reached by the cable and it’s worth. You can see full view of Seoul city if you go to the top of the tower. So 2 tickets: cable from the bottom and other ticket to go to the top. There are some ice-cream shops and cafes. But do not try Churos, its really bad hahaa."
50,5.0,"There are two ways to go up to N Seoul Tower, using a cable car or walking. We chose to go with a cable car. The cable car was pretty expensive,and a little long line, but we're okay with that. It was a beautiful view from the cable car. We can see the city view. When we arrived,  we bought a love lock and hang it there. Overall, it was an excellent experience"
51,4.0,"Cost for a combo for two is ¥24000 Korean Won , this included 2 adults, 2 large soft drinks and 2 large pop corns with choices of 4 taste. Beer combo cost a big more. Very popular place with tourist and local, we took cable car up there , cost ¥9500 @ for return , not a very long ride,  but a walk to the escalator before you reach the cable car station. Too much for elderly. Better take a bus to cable car station . alternatively you can take a circle line bus from the closest subway station cost about ¥1250 @ way  to the tower and no cable car . You may order the entry ticket online and get ¥6000 which most people do. Try out some websites. The view is authentic especially the night view but the viewing deck is relatively congested. The snack bar lighting is too bright so the reflection blocked your view . Seoul is large city but not as many high raise than inHong Kong. So the night view appears less impressive than in HK. With the price is value for money . Can’t miss. Highly recommend. Even you don’t go up the tower , the ground level five storey decking is still good enough to have good view if the city . Remember go when the weather is clear."
52,3.0,"Want some fresh air and exercise? A good way to do that is to walk up one of the many trails or paths/steps to the top. A nice walk with good scenery. At the top.... well, not so great and very touristy with inflated prices for everything. I highly recommend that you forget the cable car or bus and just stroll up... a nice way to do some aerobic exercise!"
53,4.0,This is where you can get a nice view os the whole city. I decided to go up walking and there are many nice tracks to get there if you are motivated to walk more than an hours otherwise take the cable car.Plenty of restaurants and shops. Very popular place.
54,4.0,"The Seoul tower is more than a great view. It's great fun for the whole family, there a park in the area, hello kitty mini park, cheeseball adventure and plenty of wal trails to catch a view before the view. To top it off you can get there by cable car that has it own wow view."
55,4.0,It was nice day to see all Seoul in the sun sunset time.we have fun day with my family good few from up
56,5.0,N Seoul Tower is one place you must to go when you are in Seoul. What Amazing view is ! Take a bus number 5 from Myeongdong Market. Bus stop locates in  3  exit of Myeongdong subway station. N Seoul Tower is last stop.
57,5.0,"Like any other tall building/attraction, you go for the view. I found N Tower to be less of a rip off than most of these types of places. It was cool to ride the unmanned tram up a small hill to the cable car. Views were great. They do charge for the cable car as well as to go onto the observation deck and for photos but the price was reasonable. It’s a hike even with the tram and cable car so it was nice to do this towards sunset on a cooler day."
58,4.0,"It is always exciting to see the landscape of Korea, Seoul in particular on top of the tower. You can see the big buildings."
59,4.0,Best to go a little before sunset to fully enjoy the view from the o observatory. We went on a Friday late afternoon and there was queue for the cable car rides. There are many choices of food available. Do take time to enjoy a coffee and savor the sights. What was terrible was the very long queue for the elevator ride down from the observatory. It took more than 30 mins waiting time for the elevator aftet spending 15 mins in the observatory. Place was packed to the brim and we could not fully enjoy the sights.Perhaps would be better to visit during weekdays.
60,4.0,"If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city, this is the place to go. I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night. There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height."
61,5.0,We took the cable car up to the tower.  It was a lot bitter than I imagined.  It has few restaurants and many sites for photos.  We loved walking around the tower and taking in the view of the city.  We ate at the restaurant at the tower and it was surprising really good.  It was well worth the trip.
62,5.0,"We visited the N Seoul Tower in April 2019, and were not disappointed. The surrounding was beautiful with cherry blossoms all around it.  The view was spectacular, especially at the top of the tower.We bought the tickets the day before on Trazy.com, and got a 25% discount. It was easy to exchange e-vouchers for tickets at the kiosks at the Tower.My recommendation is to take the bus (cheaper than cable car), which drop people off near the tower - only a short walk to it. Be prepare to walk uphill a little bit."
63,4.0,"If you intend to take the cable car to and fro to Seoul Tower , please dont as it is not worth it , More than 35, were sardined in and with hardly any place to move , there is nothing to enjoy. Its just a waste of money. Take the bus."
64,4.0,"Well, pretty much what you'd expect - some great views, some tacky but fun souvenirs etc. Cable car ride is fun, as is expected. Nice territory to walk around as well."
65,4.0,My first trip there. Good eye opener to see how this being built and its concept. The weather was not good during our visit. Could really see the outside view. But with visiting. The ticket price cheaper will be good.
66,3.0,"Other than the steep steep walk towards the tower where the padlocks are, there wasn't really much to see here.  The food at the top were limited and pricey.  Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that we've seen it.Note the treetops with LARGE bird nests and the walk path that abound with beautiful flowers including tulipsThere are many stalls at the top selling assorted merchandise - all pricey :)"
67,4.0,Awesome site to see while in Korea. It’s a must see. We went to the top and took pictures. There’s even the little lock thing that people do. You can’t miss it they’re everywhere. They sell them there so no worries about bringing your own. I was told they’re love locks.
68,5.0,"Must visit in Seoul. Colder up there, wear warmer clothes and gear specially if you’re visiting from October to April."
69,5.0,"For first-time visitors, and if sightseeing is an important agenda in your visit then you should definitely visit this place. For starters, it gives you a breathtaking view of Seoul and depending on visibility, you can see nearby mountain ranges. I assume that it also gives a very nice view at night where you can see the vibrant lights of Seoul City.If you are with your sweetheart, you can also venture and put a lovelock here to show your affection to him or her. Together with all the other lovebirds who've also done it before you."
70,4.0,"There are two ways to go, by walk and by cable car. We had used walk. Many stairs in a beautiful forest full of spring flowers and birds. Tired but happy. On top was waiting for us N Seoul Tower. View from the top is amazing. Special, when is good weather and visability. You can took great photos of Seoul. In tower are place yo eat, play, restrooms. Gift shops tax free. Also you can leave your love lock.Fully recommended."
71,5.0,"Once we got off the bus, we were surprised by the steep walk up the tower. It was difficult especially with a stroller. Then, when we got to the foot of the tower, there was a long line in the elevator and we decided to take the stairs so were very tired when we arrived to the viewing deck. The view was wonderful. We then paid a ticket to go to the very top of the tower - the view was good but it was very crowded. Please avoid going on a weekend or on a holiday!"
72,4.0,"This is a super fun day out--especially if you like hiking! We decided to walk from our hotel (turned out we were ill-prepared...lol), and there is are well-defined trails with pretty scenery and a couple of rest-stops where you can buy drinks and snacks on the way up. Once there, there are a bunch of great photo ops, including a pagoda, the padlock ""love"" fence, and of course the tower itself. The price to go up the tower is very reasonable (if you have kids, you'll probably spend more at the candy shop at the top....haha), and on a non-dusty day the views are supreme."
73,4.0,Try to go from evening to night. U get a nicer view of the city. There is long queue but move quite fast
74,5.0,They provide a shuttle bus from the subway station. This bus stop in some points and also reach the tower park area. Cost 10.000 Won for observatory deck but I bought online in Klook.com because it's cheaper (half price). Locals bring food and do some picnics in this area. I shd bring food here hahaha... Well in N Seoul Plaza yes there are many restaurant to choose. I eat budaejjigae here and it's delicious.
75,4.0,This place is very nice specially for lovers. It has a view overseeing the city which is  very beautiful. Nice place for picture taking. Senior citizens will find it a little bit challenging to climb. Must see when visiting korea.
76,5.0,This place is totally worth going up to. The 360 view of the city is fantastic!  There is plenty of room for everyone to get a view.
77,5.0,We rode the gondola to the top of the hill and enjoyed the views from Seoul Tower. The souvenir shop and the teddy bear shop were favorites. We hiked down and enjoyed the vistas along the way.
78,5.0,"Nice view. This is up at the top of a mountain. The area has the Lovelocks corner where you see a lot of padlocks put by couples and you can even put one too. There's a store there selling love locks. There's also the beacons, and the tower itself which you can go up using an elevator. At the top, the view is nice. You get to see the city view. There are also a lot of souvenir shops and food stalls at the top of the tower. At the top is a little small so you may notice there are a lot of people beside you.Going to the location: Make sure you're prepared to walk uphill here. Maybe 10-15 mins walk, as the bus cant go up any higher. Also make sure not to let your children run down this hill because one of the people in our tour group had let her children ran off and they came rolling downhill. Good thing there were people who managed to catch the child. But please be careful with your children going up or down the hill."
79,1.0,The view is great but the 90 minutes que to lower elevator and 60 minutes que at the top is not worth it.Go there and enjoy the view from the lower deck for free.
80,5.0,"The walk towards the tower may seem exhausting at first but once you get to the place and see the view of Seoul, you regain all that drained energy 😂 The view is definitely breathtaking ❤ The only thing I disliked about it was that we were on a tour group so we had little time to savor the beautiful weather up there as well as the stunning view of the city. Oh well, there is always a next time 😊🤞"
81,5.0,"It was an overwhelming experience to see the downtown Seoul especially in the middle of the night when the city lights are colourful, we also managed to send a postcard to the post box right at the observation deck. Thanks to Klook we managed to get a discount price and save a time."
82,5.0,I usually shy from expensive tower attractions that involve several intervals lining up in queues. Mid morning and midday really was not bad for the lines. We had no more than 10 minute waits. You absolutely MUST go to the bathroom as both genders have private bathroom views!
83,3.0,"This was a nice stop.  At your leisure you can walk from the bus stop up to the Seoul Tower. My son and I were looking forward to the Cable Car but when we go to the top, we found out it was closed. We were so disappointed.... Anyways ...we just walked around the viewing area and watched a Korean demo and display.  We also had lunch in one of the few restaurant they have inside the tower."
84,5.0,You can ride the cable car from Myungdong near Sinsegae Dept. store or ride city bus which is easier at the bus stop located just in front of from Namsan Hanok Village or Daehan Cinema at Chungmooro metro station.
85,4.0,"The tower experience itself is quite good. IMHO however, the Seoul skyline isn't particularly striking (e.g. compared to Busan). There are enough interesting things to eat and explore around the tower as well to spend a couple of hours.Tip: be sure to check out the restroom on the lower observation deck 4F! :)"
86,5.0,We went on a nice sunny clear day and were able to see all around the city.  I recommend getting the beer and popcorn adult package (you can take it up with you).
87,4.0,"Went to N Seoul Tower for the 3rd time already..never fails to amaze me. My faves there are visiting the Hello Kitty Island & the Locks of Love. So easy to go there from Myeongdong, just ride Bus 05. Always enjoyed my experience in N Seoul Tower! Till next time!"
88,4.0,"My family of 4 stayed near Seoul Tower and made the mistake of choosing to walk to the tower. From the map, we are just less than 800m away to the tower. But the walk to the tower took us nearly an hour. The 1st part was just a uphill walk, quite tiring but managable. The 2nd part are mostly steps. We saw lots of cars parking at the end of the 1st part and some cars parked at the tower. From some reviews, we gathered there is a bus which we could have taken.The view on top was great. The space at the observatory is not big and I was surprised to see quite a no of people. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the tower. We went to Owl's Cutlet and the food was great."
89,4.0,"if you have been to other higher places in world, this doesn't give you that adrenaline rush. bt still, its good for one time visit and those love locks are good for romantic evenings."
90,3.0,"Whether it is due to time constraints or the weather is too cold/cloudy, N Seoul Tower is your alternative to Building 63.With the Seoul Discover Pass, you'll get to enter the Observatory Deck for free and get 30 degrees view of the city.The surrounding areas at the feet of the tower are nice for photo ops. Just gotta find the right spots."
91,5.0,"We loved our time climbing from Meong Dong to the tower, great to make you feel warm, as the snow just fell the night before. We loved the view and the landscape."
92,5.0,Every previous visit to Seoul had been cloudy or rainy meaning the tower was not good to visit. This time was a beautiful sunny day and worth the visit.We went up to the tower in the cable car which was fun in itself.
93,4.0,"If you want a perfect view, take the cable car up to the base of the Seoul Tower, and walk down the trail to the national library. It is around 860m, with a stopby to see the view. We went there at 2000hrs. Very nice.Seoul tower itself, going up, you wouldn't see best view, although you can see a smaller version of Seoul through unwashed windows. Up there, you can only go in a circle, and buy souvenirs. For me it's overrated.Check my pictures I've attached for the view I was talking about."
94,3.0,"One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation. Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking"
95,4.0,Short waiting time A bit steep and I’m not sure it’s suutable for people with a disability in parts . Cracking views
96,5.0,very nice view by the way on top of the hill some small  kiosks with refreshing drink and foodeasy access
97,3.0,Queues for >1 hour to boardand the cablecar with people cutting queues. A better system could be in place.
98,5.0,The views from the tower is amazing birds eye view of the city. At night the city looks spectacular. Loads of restaurants and shops and the sunset from there is beautiful.
99,5.0,Good place to see Seoul 360 degree. Not a crowded place even during Christmas period. Will go again in different seasons.
100,4.0,Nice sunny day so we got good 360 view of Seoul. Went there on Friday morning so it was not that crowded. We took bus 02 from Hanok Village which took us directly up to N Seoul Tower and later took bus 03 which took us to our next destination which was Itaewon. Very convenient
101,3.0,"From Myeongdong subway station, you can easily walk your way up a steep road to the cable car station that will bring you up the tower. The cable car comes in frequency of 10 minutes and will be filled to its max capacity with people. My family went in the evening and saw the sunset. Also, the good part about going in the evening is that you get to see the day view & also the night view. Objectively, I do not find the view from the top especially amazing. But nonetheless still scenic. I am guessing most people go to see/put their couple lock. There is a mall there that sells souveniors, food and other things too."
102,5.0,Not suitable for elderly people that can’t walk far and up the hill.  The parking space for vehicles are way down the hill. But it’s a beautiful place if it’s not raining and foggy.
103,5.0,We went there before sunset and manage to see Seoul from above coming alove with the lovely lights! Plenty of beautiful photo worthy shots in the changing light.
104,4.0,"Nice veiw over Seoul, but a very long wait for the elevator. Visit the skybar and enjoy the veiw. It must have been one of the most expensive touristattractions in Seoul.  Still worth a visit."
105,4.0,"enjoying the sights of Seoul city from a height, is the icon of Seoul city. the love padlock is an attraction for tourists visiting here. facilities available both even for parents and even pregnant women because there is a cable car available"
106,4.0,You must go there and remind you to try the lunch buffet at the lower level.  The price is very good.  Just around $16 in the Canadian dollar.  The other lunch buffet is double this price.  Please try to go there on a sunny day when the view is good too.
107,5.0,Stunning view from the top. A little bit expensive for me. Food is also good. Things selling here is pricey
108,5.0,"Been visiting Korea for two consecutive years and wasnt able to visit this top spot in Korea snd frlt the need to come back and see this beauty ,so I did not want to miss seeing this the second time and I love it! Very picturesque"
109,5.0,"Having been here twice ; first via coach stop which required visitors to walk up a very steep road up, then took cable ride, I can say that cable ride is more fun and offer better view. KLOOK voucher exchange can be done at Level 5 via few machines. Easy."
110,4.0,"We went at night on 2018 Boxing Day and it was freezing! There is a long line for the cable car going up / down but it's well supervised and no pushing & shoving - everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable. About a 15 minute wait in line either way. You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain. We didn't go up the Tower (tickets were very pricey but I don't recall the exact price).The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top, go up if you enjoy the view.One can also opt to walk up / down and I would've considered the walk down if I had time to spare, it would have been pleasant in the cold.Word of warning though - heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter - the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices - we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices. We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest - so it's possible."
111,4.0,"This is quite a nice place to visit. Taking cable car, one can view Seoul areas. If you are challenging, I would suggest you to walk down in order to appreciate more about Seoul. However, the best time to visit this place is evening after 4pm when the sun on the other side and you can take beautiful pictures. Enjoy."
112,5.0,"Cable car return tickets cost 8,500 won per person and entrance fee to the actual tower was an additional 10,000 won per person. The elevator had an entertaining projection on the ceiling while going up for 30 seconds. The views from the top of the hill are definitely worth it because Seoul is a clean and attractive, easy to look at city. The windows of the observation deck have names of other world cities and distances to them so you can have your photos taken by ‘your’ home name. Even the toilet cubicles have a view! The restaurants at the observation deck are overpriced so just wait until you go out to the terrace where there are several coffee shops, ice creamery and a couple of average restaurants.  We spent some 2 hours all in all.  Better to buy a one way cable car ticket and walk down the nice paved path."
113,4.0,"It takes about 10-15mins walk from Myeong-dong to reach the elevator which will bring up to the cable car station. The cost for round trip for cable car was 8000krw. Upon reaching the top of the hill, you could decide if you want to go up the tower. Even if you decide not to go up, you will still get a good view and there are lots of places for taking photos. Just like most of the towers,  you get panoramic view of the city at the top of the tower. The ride up the tower was interesting with the display on the ceiling of the elevator."
114,5.0,Spend my time at the Seoul tower....a lot of places you can go once you reached on top via the cable car...Nice view...Reccomended for all...
115,4.0,"We made journey but it was worth it. They view is phenomenal, especially at night seeing the palaces lighten up. Very polite people who were guides. Advise anybody that is going to wear sneakers.  It is a good hike"
116,5.0,"I think Seoul is an identical metropolis. It is green , not tall city like suburban or something like that. But it is really a metro , full of many transportation and technology. Actually I don't like to pay for climbing to see view in high rises like this. And some time it was disappointment. This time I had read reviews in this Tripadvisor and finally went to. From above , you will see this green metropolis clearly. It was beautiful. In fact the ticket for transportation  itself is not expensive. But if you want to challenge yoursef , you may climb to the base of the tower with your own feet."
117,5.0,"favourite part were the love locks !! i loved being so high up and the view was so beautiful, spent 3 hours taking beautiful pictures here"
118,5.0,"Entering the structure through a LED tunnel was amazing! Going up the observatory through the elevator was an experience itself with the short video clip watched on the elevator ceiling. The whole of Seoul can be seen at every level of the tower but best at the observatory, and even through the bathroom! A must-visit place in Seoul!"
119,4.0,"We took a short cable car to the base of the tower since we had a stroller, but it would be a nice walk. We did not go up into the tower but the base was a large park area with nice views of the city and mountains."
120,5.0,"A trip up N Seoul Tower ensures you appreciate the size and area of Seoul.  Even after spending a few days here, we had no idea of the scale of Seoul until we went up the Tower."
121,5.0,"Had an ir temp handheld for this trip. First time to get a headache from the weather haha Kids love it , just be sure to be prepared especially if reaching night time. Ate at n burger for dinner :-)"
122,4.0,This area is walking distance from the Myeong-dong area (about 15-20 mins). You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower. The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!). We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower.
123,5.0,We had the Discover Seoul Pass and we utilise it got our visit to this atttaction. Easily accessible by the shuttle bus which has several pickup points at several convenient metro stations . Good panoramic view of the city . Prob a must see attraction for tourists
124,4.0,"We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD6.50/pax, much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite. If travelling by taxis, you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus. Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long. After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you. We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded.  I feels this can give a miss.  The love-locked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views."
125,3.0,Good views only if the smog and pollution have cleared out. Go after a big rain. Buses go to the top but the is no car parking at the top. There is also a crowded cable car that will take you up to the top.
126,5.0,"It was amazing. The cable car was smooth ride. We also tried the stairs even though its high. The park is nicely clean and the flowers were beautiful and colourful. The people were friendly and nice to talk to. I highly recommend this place for people who will visit Seoul, Korea. Top list."
127,3.0,"Wasnt prepared to walk 20 to 30 minutes uphill to reach the cable car station.   The station was very packed with 2 car rotating.  Quite slow and packed,  really packed.  The view was fantastis especially it is winter time, cool off the tireness from walking all the way up."
128,5.0,"Good place for memories taking photos , have coffee shop and small restaurant you can see nice view of Seoul from there easy access by bus 03/05/04 have 5 floors as well as the shiny lock you can buy lock twin and place it there for good luck in relation that’s ver romantic"
129,5.0,"We decided to go up the tower at about 3pm (stayed until 7pm) so that we could view the afternoon, sun set and night scene since it was winter.  There is a 10% discount coupon if you buy the T-money card from the subway vending machine, one discount per coupon.Pro :1) Excellent 360-degree view of Seoul. The toilet has excellent view too.2) There are cafes and restaurants.  It is generally more expensive, as expected.3) Can rent the local costumes for photography.Con :1) May be very crowded during the weekend.  We went on a Monday and there was moderate crowd.2) Can be noisy if there is a school group.A must visit once if you are in Seoul."
130,4.0,Namsan Tower is one of the key place that my daughter wants to go.  Watching the drama Deep Blue Sea with Lee min ho drives her crazy for visiting Seoul.  It's quite a climb after the bus dropped us.  Wish the bus can reach nearer to the tower.  It'll be quite tough for the child or elderly to climb up.  But the view is worth it!  Had a great time here.
131,5.0,"We got the cable car up to the tower and it was incredible seeing the while of seoul .. the tower its self was very busy with a large school trip when we were there, but still its plenty big enough the locks are amazing there is so many I could have spent all day reading them .."
132,5.0,"Wow.   Amazing value and gorgeous views from the top of Seoul, our family loved this tower.   Should be #1 place to start your visit to Seoul.   (By the way, cross Lotte World Adventure off your list, absolutely diabolical, that's the tip from our kids too)."
133,5.0,The family enjoyed the tower and had dinner just outside overlooking the city.  We went a second time to see the sunset!
134,5.0,"What beautiful views of the city that just keeps going! We made a half days of it. We hiked a little, took the tram, ate lunch looking over the city and then added a lock to the already thousands placed there! Took some amazing photos too! My toddlers loved all the colorful locks and the lock “trees” and the tram."
135,4.0,"Visiting N tower marked my presence at the very spot where my fav drama was filmed <3It was a lovely walk up the hill and once we were up there, we got a gorgeous view of autumn leaves and the big city laid right down below."
136,5.0,"Here, too many people using cable car on queue, so I only walk to Tower takes 1/2 hour, Ohhh... so tired. please bring your water. Beautiful places and blossoms. For couples and families can buy key worth $15 inside shopping area. There you can see many keys"
137,4.0,We went there at night. But i guess the view during the nighttime is better because of the amazing lights. It’s just very chilly. We had to walk from the foot of the hill to the Seoul Tower entrance. And it’s December so it’s expected to be cold. Just prepare warm coats.
138,3.0,"Our trip started when we walk from myeong dong to the 45 degrees ""train"" at foot of the hill, it's free but works like a lift, sometime it could get over crowded. Then reaching the top, we proceed to buy our ticket for the cable car tower, there was no queue when I was there, but I can imagine the freezing cold waiting in line to buy the ticket, better use klook app and get some discount or buy at the machine. Still we need to queue going up the stairs to the cable car (more like cable BUS) there are 2 BUS one goes up one comes down. They will crowd about 20 people or so into the STANDING only BUS. If you are unlucky enough, you get squeezed into the middle of the BUS and see nothing but other people's head. So I suggest that if you moved towards the door and the BUS is still not full, stand aside for other people to board, you rush in to the next ride for prime view.During cold season, when you reach the top, it is freezing windy, so be prepared for the open air walk. Bring your own lock if you do not want to buy the ""LOVE LOCK"" at the top of the hill. Put your lock and throw the key....into a box provided. (unlike the romantic movie where you throw it into the forest.The tower ticket is way too expensive and I think day time is better, because the night scene can hardly be seen with lots of souvenir store lights reflecting against the windows, so you have to press your head against the glass to really see night scene of seoul.I didn't get to try the food so no comment on that.Sit around for a while, enjoy the noisy tourist taking photos and shouting children, trek down hill if you feel like it, should not take more than an hour."
139,3.0,"For 10,000 won experience, it was ok generally. But at the queue, you will have to take a mandatory shoot & select your desired photo once you reached the top. The lift queue was a torture for me as it was stuffy and took some time before you could take the lift up (full of tourists and tour groups). The view was magnificient too as it was near sunset when we went...and too many people trying to get a good picture everywhere. Then the tragedy began when you need to head back down...the lift queue was super long! Took us almost half an hour to get down! Then at the 1st floor, it’s where you will visit the Love Locks gallery...and that’s about all for this famous N Seoul Tower (all you see on K Dramas) 🥴"
140,4.0,"You need to pay if you want to go on top of the tower. However, you can still able to take nice photo from the lower deck of the tower without going up. Nice place to visit in Seoul. Many buses go to Namsan Tower and it just within 10mins walk from the bus stop to the entrance of Namsan Tower."
141,5.0,"Though you have another tower to visit, this tower is so lovely, please visit, you can take public transport, so easy and well connected, spend sometime there, go with family or close friends"
142,4.0,Seoul tower sits on top of a hill. Can travel on top by cable car. 9000+ krw (both way) per person. Can also walk up to the top. Nice walk up. Good work out.
143,4.0,Must visit the Seoul tower while in Seoul.The views from the top is beautiful and you can see the whole Seoul from there. It’s beautiful especially at night. You can take the cable car to the top if you don’t want to walk. It’s about 1 mile walking to the tower.
144,3.0,"The N Seoul Tower, officially the YTN Seoul Tower and commonly known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul, South Korea. Construction started 1969.  At 236m, it marks the second highest point in Seoul.  This place is famous for Korean drama movies shooting; many Korean dramas scenes are shot in this place.  Nice view of Seoul. There’s a souvenir shop here.  Don’t take a taxi.  Just take Bus Number 2 or 5 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the way up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults and 350 for children.  Seoul Tower was remodeled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005, with the name of N Seoul Tower.  The N stands for new."
145,5.0,"Climbing up the uphill landscape towards Namsan is totally worth every step. It was one of the most beautiful sights that I have ever seen in my whole life. The night lights of the city are like stars that brings everything to life. They carry a vibrancy and serenity at the same time. We were literally huffing and puffing on our way up on a cold and windy autumn night. But all the huffing and puffing didn't really matter when got to take a look of the beautiful gift that Namsan gave us. My sister and I literally just stood in there for quite sometime taking in the magnificence of the view. On our right the Seoul city view and to our left the majestic N Seoul Tower. It was a perfect night to end our first day in Korea. We also got to have a picture where Cha Taehyun posed for a picture for The Seollal Episode in 2 days and 1 night. Fun fact: Our guide told us that if the tower in lit Green meaning the atmosphere is clear of the microdirt and the air is clean. Other colors such as blue and red, indicates a different reading. On our way down, wind blew and ginko leaves fell, adding to the serene ambiance. Definitely worth hiking!"
146,5.0,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same 😀
147,3.0,"The observation deck was relatively expensive (if only for 360 view of Seoul). I enjoyed the The Love Chair and Padlock area, it seem to bring couples much closer together."
148,4.0,"It is a good experience for the family, especially with kids and the love lock on the N Korea Tower. Very affordable. Walk up to the tower and then use the free elevator to come down from mountain to street  level."
149,2.0,"Bought the combo which includes the N burger set plus observatory admission. Observatory was okay. View is nice but the kids found it too boring so we were out in less than 15 mins. We didn't realise that taxis are not allowed into the area. The taxi driver took us to the cable car station instead. There are shuttle buses going in and out. Price is 1200 won per person regardless of child or adult. Prepare exact as there will be no change given. The burger set meal was a bad experience. Burger was so so. The staff did not allow us to change drinks. Was told to clear the table after we are done with the meal - which we happily did but while throwing the stuffs away, we were given death stare by the staffs as we clearly did not know which rubbish should go into which bin. If you expect tourist to clear their own tables, please don't give us a bad attitude when we try to do it to our best understanding. Once we got the the restaurant and handed them our coupon for the burger set, the staff rolled her eyes and told another person to serve us. Seriously? Given a rating of 2 for the view."
150,5.0,"We came here at late afternoon. It had a beautiful bird's eyeview of Seoul. I imagine the view would be even more beautiful at night.For those who do not want to get tired walking up, there is a free roundtrip shuttle from Seoul Station and Myeongdong. From the shuttle stop in Namsan Park, you can take the cable car to the tower."
151,5.0,"Long steep climb to the tower. Decided not to take the cable car. Well lit walkway and stairs. Restroom stop part way up. The view is spectacular. Went at night,  so lots of lights. Enjoyed popcorn and beer for two while waiting for the elevator. Convenient wait for your number to go up. Very long line going back down."
152,5.0,We had a great day walking and putting our lock at the tower. They have places to get snacks and an arcade my son loved. Spend a half day here at minimum.
153,5.0,"This is one of the most iconic touristic places in Seoul city, not just because of the popularity among tourists but also the deeply ingrained historical meaning that this piece of architecture has for Seoul and their citizens.If you have been in Seoul for at least a week or more and you still haven´t visited the N Seoul Tower you might have noticed that you can see this touristic attraction from anywhere in Seoul. And since the tower is located on the top of the Namsam park and it glows in different colors at night, this makes tourists wonder about what's happening on the top of that mountain, so don´t waste your time and go have some fun up thereFirstly, you can get up there on foot in 30 minutes or you can take a cable car and appreciate the landscape of Seoul city and the park as well. If you decide to take the cable car there is a return ticket and one-way ticket for both children and adults. I recommend you to consider the weather before choosing between getting up there on foot. If you do it by foot you can appreciate and surround yourself with the nature of the park but winter is so cold in Korea that temperatures can plunge to -20 degrees in late January and not everyone has experienced that temperatures in their countries. On the other hand, if you are visiting Seoul during the fall you'll have a great time watching the autumn foliage.Secondly, once you are at the top of the Namsan park you'll see that there are many ways to have fun and have a quality time with friends and family. There are several foreign and Korean restaurants at affordable prices and many souvenirs shops too. And if you are lucky you will see a Korean royal guard ceremony or a Pansori presentation which is a Korean traditional folk dance. Outside and on the right side of the tower, there is a wooden deck where you can see the cityscape of Seoul."
154,3.0,"Reach this area via cable car.  Came around 5 in the afternoon and the line in the cable car was long but moving.  Reach the tower around sunset and by the time we reach the love locks it started to get dark.  We have a love lock on hand and found a spot for it.  Took some photos, ate some snacks and went to the observatory.  There is also a line to reach the top of the tower.  During our visit the place was really crowded and going back via cable car was also the same.  I guess when you visit this place you should have enough time to spare or else you won't enjoy it as it feels like everything was hurried because of the crowd."
155,4.0,A good place to visit from a list of must do in Seoul. There is the love locks ..a good view from the top
156,5.0,"Our trip to N Seoul Tower was so exciting. At first, we were worried that we might get lost going there, but with available online maps, we were able to arrived there so easy and fast just by train and bus. Once in the N Tower, process in going to the view deck is very organized that even too much people were there as it was I guess peak hour (6pm), the piles and waiting took us more or less 30-45mins. The view of the whole Seoul was awesome during the night. There are lots of instagramable picture perfect locations around N Seoul Tower specially those with their loved ones. Surely, would still love to be back to see and enjoy at daytime."
157,3.0,"Visited the tower at night. The line going up and coming down the cable car was so long. Waited for like 1 hour or more. Once at the observation deck, not what I expected it to be. The place is not that big and it became too crowded. Could not enjoy the view because there were too many people. Walking around the deck was troublesome too."
158,4.0,"Popular with tourists; expect some crowd. Que for cable car was long at the time but it does move at a reasonable pace.  A nice, short ride by cable car. Go up the tower observation deck and the view there is fantastic. There is a Cafe’ and a souvenier shop where I bought some unique and cute postcards. They sell stamps. Drop in their mailbox... so convenient."
159,4.0,Took the cable car to and from the tower to enjoy the autumn scenery. Watch the beauty of different colours of the trees on the hills.
160,5.0,"Was with my sisters and 2 nephews. We took the Seoul City Bus which has N Seoul Tower as one of its stops. We took nice photos before going up the Tower. Very nice view from the Tower and cost is reasonable to go up the Tower. Coming down, we had some food, enjoyed by kids and us Moms."
161,4.0,IT is a long step climb to reach The TOP but worth The effort to glimpse The 360 view OF Seoul. There are a lot OF Tourist and there was Cultural Show at The open Space. The view is awesome ON all sides OF The City. There are stores and restaurants for meals or snacks. You have a choice to Go UP The Tower but you have to pay to ride The elevator. A must see when IT The area.
162,4.0,"This is a great area to visit during day or night. They have great views of the city! You can see it from the top, where there is a 360 degrees viewing floor with windows all around. There is an area u can hang your love locks to commemorate your visit or for your significant other... I think a must place to visit is the bathroom in the tower. You get an amazing view while you use the bathroom (at least in the women's)."
163,4.0,Good to experience specially if you are a fan of the Love Locks area and to view the panoramic side of things of the city. Things may tend to queue up during peak hours at the cable car so be sure be there before 5pm and hopefully there are not so many groups tours as it gets crowded.
164,5.0,"We were staying in Myeongdong area and we walk all the way to the cable car station, is easy to find just follow the google map will do :) We were there on 19/10 and the view and the weather is just perfect! Autumn season is the best time to visit Korea I guess! We found a few photo spots and managed to take some photos because it wasn't crowded on that day. The B duck status is so cute and the love locks bridge is just so eye catching. We spent a few hours up there mainly enjoying the scenery."
165,4.0,"I took the loop bus no 5 (1100 won) from myeongdong exit 3 bus stop. Took us 30 minutes to reach the tower. Once alight, there is still a very steep slope to reach the tower. It is the same, irregardless which transport you take (cable car). Nice observatory to see the whole of Seoul, with its autumn colors slowly turning."
166,4.0,"Recommended to find a way to the cable car station, we walk upslope to the station..Take a cable car to enjoy the scenery to N Seoul Tower.Plenty of food options.Good time to visit is an hour before sunset."
167,5.0,"Take the cable car - although we did have to squeeze alongside a ton of people but if you’re going in autumn, it’s worth it. We loved taking pictures here and our 4yo and 7yo loved to run around and also got to go to Hello Kitty Island (which isn’t an island but rather a unit which takes you through Hello Kitty history and rooms). My kids did enjoy this. We chose not to go up the tower - we did this the last time we went to Namsan so we didn’t feel it was worth the money. You don’t need to bring any locks along as they are also sold in kiosks for krw10,000 on location. I would suggest going early as it gets more and more crowded as the day passes."
168,4.0,We came for a nite view. And its beautiful... After using 3mins claiming my online ticket ... And 10mins queue. We r up there.Nite view are beautiful. There s a few restaurant n cafe. Expect a 1hour trip.
169,5.0,I bring my daughter use wheelchair to see seoul from here. She's very love it...but no sign for wheelchair clearly so we very difficult to find way. I ask a few times to other people to get way for wheelchair.
170,3.0,"First I must say that during Chuseok is not the best time to visit Namsan Seoul tower. The queus was out of this world, so many people visited Namsan tower during the holiday (we visited Namsan on the 2nd day of Chuseok). Not only the queue to the cable car but when you reach at the top, there were so many people making it hard to enjoy the sceneries. On top of that, getting a food is another struggle (due to the queue). I’d rather visit it on another time, taking pictures is not possible I might say due to huge crowd everywhere!"
171,5.0,Nice to take the cablecar to reach the top of the mountain and enjoy the view.We were delighted to see a martial art show at the base of the tower.
172,5.0,"Seoul Tower is an iconic site to see in Korea. A little known fact is the color the tower is lit, actually indicates visibility conditions. Blue is clear and best viewing, green is next best equaling a little hazy, and red means bad air quality and limited visibility, so best to visit on a blue day.The cable car is fun, also if you like hiking its a fun time too.Good eateries at the base of the tower as well."
173,4.0,"Although it looks awesome in the night, don’t go on weekend nights! The walk uphill to the cable car ride was long and tiring and estimated waiting time was 90mins and additional waiting time up the tower was 70mins. A lot of time wasted..."
174,5.0,Thanks to our guide Mike for working overtime in sending us to visit N Seoul Tower and back to Insadong Street after our trip to Nami Island and Petite France.
175,4.0,"Had three kids along so decided to save a few bucks and just to go up to the area around the tower. It had plenty of excellent vantage points of Seoul in all directions and plenty of food and beverage options too. Kids enjoyed finding where we were staying, but once you've had a look there's not really anything else to do so we had to bribe them with churros."
176,4.0,"You have three options to access the tower, first you can take the cable car both ways, second you can take the cable car one way and walk the other, or third you can walk up the hill to the tower and down back.We took the cable car both ways and we were glad we did as it rained heavily shortly after we got down from the tower.The tower offers a great views of the city and it is very beautiful."
177,5.0,"N Seoul Tower is perched on a hill that requires a bit of walking. But if you don't want to walk, there are other ways that can get you there. But the walk is worth it because you can admire the scenery while trying to reach your goal. The N Tower offers an amazing view much better than the other towers I visited. And most importantly, it's cheap. A $10 per person is a small price to pay to be mesmerized by this amazing City."
178,4.0,I really recommended to come in cherry blossom season ! 1 point shorts for the way walk to cable car was far and slope. It’s not good for elderly.
179,4.0,We went up using a cable car. The place is busy with tourists and has lots of love locks. It has a beautiful view of the city. But nothing much to do so allocate 1-2hrs only in this place. We went up the tower and had a good Korean dinner. The tower is a sight to behold at night.
180,3.0,"Quite expensive, if you want to include going up the actual.  The cable car only takes you to the base of the tower.  Very busy, however we went up just as it was getting dark.  Amazing views of the city, well worth the visit."
181,4.0,"You have to ride the cable car or take the bus to reach the mountain. When I saw all the love locks, I was quite overwhelmed. I felt the immense hope and optimism that caused each couple to place a love lock there. There is a viewing deck overlooking the city. Unfortunately, it was raining hard when we went there so we weren’t able to appreciate the view."
182,5.0,"Namsan tower was amazing. it will give you a 360 degrees birds eye view of the entire city. There are 2 ways to get to the tower. first is by bus and second is by cable car. We chose the Namsan cable car which can accommodate about 50 persons at a time. There you can also find souvenir shops, restaurants, hello kitty & Sentoy museums. The famous love locks. recommended to wait for the sunset and hight time when the tower was lit. definitely seouls icon."
183,5.0,The views from the top of the tower are awesome.  I would not recommend going on a Saturday night as it was very crowded. It seemed to be date night.  There are restaurants and souvenir stores.  Well worth it.
184,4.0,"We took taxi from the Hotel Shinshin and arrive at our first line to take a cable car up to our second line to take the gondola up the tower. You can walk all these parts if you feel so inclined. The walk from the gondola building to the tower being the longest. Once at the tower there are many restaurants and shops and for an additional 10000 won to go to the top of the tower, another line. Once at the top of the tower the view is amazing, but you wait in another line to come down to the gondola building.one line to come down on the cable car. Sorry for being somewhat a downer about the lines. All the lines did move quickly for the amount of people. Saturday is not the night to go is my point. The rest of the experience was wonderful, the sites were amazing and well worth the visit.Take enough money so you can do everything you want!"
185,4.0,"Better go here at night time so that you can enjoy the night lights. Also, you might want to go up here on the left side road than the one on the right since it’s less steeper. I suggest for those tourists with seniors or young children in tow to go up via the left road since you can go up to the tower through their elevator.Padlocks are pretty expensive if you purchase it there so you might want to purchase one before going here."
186,5.0,"My husband and daughter went up, initially via the cable car and then up the tower itself. I didn’t go due to vertigo!They both loved it - can see for miles!Unfortunately both caught in a massive dump of rain on their way back but both still were upbeat due to the experience.Not for those not liking heights."
187,4.0,"Our family had been to a no. of towers, not too different this one. Kids loved it, maybe the ice-cream. There is a place for lovers to place a lock to ""secure"" their love...LOL. Not muich to do, good view as usual though."
188,4.0,"The elevator was very crowded, had to queue for about 10 minutes.we climbed some stairs to the first level when we saw the love chains for the first time; it's a nice view.With all the love chains there are in this place, you could guess it's for people in love. Yet, it is more than this, because the best part is the wonderful view panorama over the City of Seoul. Luckily, we stayed long enough to see Seoul from the tower both during the day, and during the night. We eat nice food at the Japanese restaurant. Still wondering why Koreans don't give knives at the table.My granddaughter was excited to be able to sit in front of the large glass windows displaying the beautiful view over part of Seoul.All in all, it is one of the best places for tourists in Seoul."
189,4.0,N tower gives you 360 degree amazing view from the height. Whether afternoon or night the view is still awesome. The binocular helps to see more.
190,4.0,Good place to see the city of Seoul from a height.The observation deck where tickets are sold are at reasonable height so no need to buy tickets to go on top unless you are very keen.
191,5.0,"You get exceptional views once you get to the base level of the tower - without actually going further up. So, if on a tight budget, you do not need to go all the way up. There are restaurants and arcades inside so you should be able to keep the family entertained."
192,5.0,"We visited Seoul Tower in a rainy morning and were lucky in that the place was pretty empty which we understand is quite rare. That means no queuing up for anything at all.The visit began with walking through the world's first OLED Tunnel which is pretty amazing and the kids loved it. After purchasing tickets we took a locker to place our bags and then went up to the observation tower but first passing an area to take our photos which we paid for later. Despite that rainy weather the views were still pretty stunning.Once downstairs there is the large area where lovers can attach their own personal padlocks with messages of love and this in itself was pretty amazing. However, on this rainy day hardly anyone was out here.Seoul Tower is very child friendly with a Toy Museum, the LG 3D World, a place for games and a 360Degree VR Tour. In addition there are numerous restaurants and coffee shops and stores selling souvenirs.On a rainy day, due to hardly anyone being at the tower, our family had such an amazing time."
193,4.0,It’s a good exercise when climbing up the slopes towards the tower.Price of ticket is quite reasonable and great view of Seoul.
194,4.0,We tried going to namsan tower by bus from our hotel and got lost because the hotel staff didn’t say we had to cross the road from Myeongdong subway exit 4. We decided to get into a taxi when the driver kindly pointed out the bus we had to board was on opposite side of the road. So we got out of taxi and got to the right bus stop 😬.The many love locks at the tower were a feast for the eyes and the night scene of the city was lovely. The walk up and the slope to the tower was good exercise 😂
195,4.0,"This is a great place to enjoy the wonderful view of Seoul city in the open air and inside from the tower.  The view is even better if you go at sunset and stay for the night sky view. If you go with a partner or bff, make sure to take a love locket to write something and leave it chained as something special to remember."
196,5.0,"Stunning views IF its a clear day, love how they have distances to every city from the various directions on the tower, great Toy museum on the first floor too, and the cable car ride to the tower is a must too."
197,4.0,The view at the top is great.  The surrounding area is also a pleasant park for relaxing.  There is also a ‘love locks’ area at the base of the tower.
198,3.0,"We did the cable car and elevator to the top of the tower.  Total cost is about $20USD a person and takes at least 3 hours The view at night was pretty cool, but not a ""must see"".  If you have spare time or just like towers and cable cars (like me), then go ahead and spend the time & money.Otherwise, you can take a public bus close to base of tower, then walk around the grounds to get some good views and pictures.  Skip the elevator to tower observation and walk back down to bus.  Total cost is $3 and takes less than one hour."
199,5.0,"We went to the N Seoul Tower in the morning which was a cool ride with the cable cart followed by a small climb and lift ride rewarded with the best possible views of Seoul. It is on the tower where you realise what a massive city Seoul really is. Although I think the tickets to the top of the tower were worth it, if you're on a budget you can ""just"" walk (more like ""climb"") up to the base of the tower which still provides a very impressive sight of Seoul. Just make sure you don't plan that for the afternoon on a summer day. Good alternative to the Lotte World Tower as well."
200,5.0,The place is worth visiting and U should prepare your camera as the place is pictures-tic .U have to take a cable ride to the top and then another ticket to go to the  top floor for the unforgettable view .
201,4.0,N seol tower is one of the favorite tower to visit. A lot of beautiful view to see around the tower.
202,2.0,"I usually love visiting the tower / tall buildings in a city but this one is not worth it.  Maybe it was because we went on Friday night but the queues were ridiculous. We took the cable car up, which had a long queue.  Then there are a lot of steps from there (not great when you are traveling with older people who struggle with steps), and then when at the top, you have to queue again to get up the tower.  At the top of the viewing deck, I found the glass to be dirty, and there were so many people that it wasn't enjoyable.  If you are going to go, consider just taking the bus up the hill and enjoying the view from the top of the hill - in fact, it is better!"
203,2.0,"I don’t recommend people to visit, as the sightseeing is not good enough, and I take a couple of hours to wait for the tram to get there. And I only spend 20 minutes to see the sightseeing. You won’t want to see this after you have been to Victoria’s Harbour in HK"
204,4.0,"If you want to go to this place but on tight schedule, use their cable car. The cable car station is around 10 minutes walk from exit 3 of myeongdong station. But if you have extra time, just walk uphill while enjoying the scenery. Sadly when I visited here in May, it is misty so I cannot take a good pictures"
205,4.0,"Caught the Cable Car from the bottom after getting in the sideways elevator from the street. The views are amazing. Try to stick to the Left on the way up and the Right on the way down for better views. Up at the bottom of the tower there is a bit to see and do with restaurants and lookouts and exhibits. Probably more to do when the weather is not so hot because there looked like nice walking trails around. We were here to find the location of something from one of the Kdramas we watched and once we found the right spot we didn't bother to go right up the tower (and we had been up Seoul Sky Lotte Tower anyway). There were restaurants up here and we ate at one as they were reasonably priced, which was a pleasant surprise. My friends were visiting for a second time and it was fun to try to find their love lock again in amongst the massive amount of them there!!"
206,5.0,it looks very beautiful at night and if you visit you will not regret. very nice view of the city and we enjoyed every bit of time we stayed at the tower
207,3.0,"We had to wait for a specific bus that could bring us to the top, quite odd they dont allow taxis there. Beautiful view of seoul at night, wish we could stay longer as it wasnt included in our tour group itinerary so we went on our own at night. Might've been nice to see it during the day."
208,4.0,"This is our second visit, still nice to look around but a very hot weather even it is located on the hill ! We buy rainbow ice cream that almost instantly melt...Second floor with locks surrounding for taking pictures. Nice view of city of Seoul from here."
209,4.0,We went just before sunset.  The views are amazing.  the views got better as it got darker.  it is worth the view.
210,5.0,"Me and my parents went here to visit and this place is amazing! So plenty of picture opportunity! We paid around 23,000 Won to get to up the Tower.  I personally wanted to get to the tippy top but we were told we needed to request a reservation! lol! Oh well, maybe next time! But the view we got was still amazing!!! Please check out my photos!  Oh, parking here is a no-go! You have to go park near where the gondola is at or near the science building (with the round/dome roof)."
211,4.0,"Spend a leisurely half day here. On a hill top with a lot of greenery. We took the circular bus up the hill and it was a very comfortable to get there. The adventurous also walk up the hill. You take a lot of photos from the observatory tower or the lower deck when we came down. The 'love locks' all around the lower deck is interesting and a lot of other railings/areas are getting to grow these colourful locks. We also visited the 'hello kitty museum' (additional ticket). Which was very nice and loveable. A nostalgic visit and we took a lot of photos. You can buy the Observatory Tower  entry ticket on Klook.com. They will give a discount and it is valid for one year. Even if you go up the hill, you do get a good view of the city down under from the lower deck even w/o going to the observatory tower (which has a ticket) {this deck is up the broad stairs somewhat opp. the Hello Kitty Museum}. The observatory tower, is like any other tower in other cities with an all around city view. There is an upper deck and a lower deck after you go up. There is seating on the lower deck here where there is a coffee shop.      To get to the Tower we took the subway train:•	Subway Line 3, Dongguk University Station, Exit 6, take the CIRCULAR bus 02/03/05 (Strongly Recommend)OR •	Subway Line 3/4, Chungmuro Station, Exit 2 (in front of Daehan Cinema), take the CIRCULAR bus 02/05•	Subway Line 4, Myeongdong Station, Exit 3, take the CIRCULAR bus 05The Namsan Circulation Bus operates every 15-20 mins and goes to a lot of places in Central Seoul (you can choose as you deem fit for yourself), The fee is KRW1200 or 1250 by cash and KRW1100 or 1000 by T-money Card {one way cost}After you get down from the bus, there is a short steep climb to the deck (as referred above where u do not need a ticket). You can shorten this climb; look out for a lower entry with a lift (on the left side as you climb up - you cannot miss it)"
212,4.0,"this place is good enough to take pictures, but the road to this place is quite tiring because there is a fairly steep incline ... this place has a nice souvenir shop. at the top if you are a couple then can put a padlock of love so that the couple's wish materialized. this tower is south korea icon so if you visit seoul then you must come to this place."
213,5.0,"A scenic place to visit. Pleasant surroundings provide a relaxing atmosphere, while enjoying the view."
214,4.0,We took the cable car up and take note you still need to hike up the stairs abit before you reach the base of the tower. We did not experience the tower itself but mainly there for the love locks and experience. Buy the superbly delicious churros ice-cream or rainbow ice-cream from the cafes there and take a sit at the viewing gallery where there are high chairs for you to sit like a bar and enjoy the magnificient view while enjoying the sweet treat. It's FREE! :) We went to the Hanbok Cultural Museum at the basement and had a fantastic time but that is another review.
215,5.0,"Been to London, to Paris, to Sydney, to Berlin, to Dublin, to Dubai sightseeing towers but nothing compares to what you experience on top of Seoul one. Maybe Jungfrau panoramic restaurant in Switzerland can be on a par with it."
216,4.0,"We went here a saturday so I would say it was our own fault about the crowdiness ;). The view over Seoul was astonishing and the amount of padlocks were mindblowing! Even though we had to wait quite a bit to go both up and down the cable car, and up and down the tower, I would say the trip was worth it! Be prepared with a big bucket of patience and a portable fan 🤗👍🏻"
217,4.0,"N Seúl Tower visit is better at night because you can appreciate the lighting Seúl city and is more beauty,  the schedule visit is until 23 hrs. You can ride the cable car or go up by stairs ways The people who works and the staff services very professional I really recommend this attraction is very fun and good experience."
218,4.0,"Visited during the summer with the hope of catching the pretty night view, but the afternoon went long, and until 7PM the sky was still bright. Went up to the 360° observatory deck and the view is very pretty indeed. You can see the city of Seoul, the Han River from many angles. I suggest you order the ticket from online websites before your visit as you can get cheaper price (e.g. Klook).Below the tower is the love lock place you can enter for free and a spacious park where you can also view the city from a height.There are many senior citizens visiting the place to exercise and stroll with friends."
219,3.0,"Located near Myeongdong station, so it's easy to reach. You need to walk around 1 hour to reach the top (assuming you take picture along the way). But it's like mini hiking all the way. elderly / children stroller / wheelchair will be difficult to go. There is a cable car but you have to pay. Beside, it's more fun to walk actually because there are things to see / restaurant / interesting photo opportunities."
220,4.0,"This is one of the attractions to accomplish during any Seoul visitA bit crawled becuase of touristic mean.Wondeful place to take panoramic photos, selfies of Seoul from different angles.I'd recommend visit this place during late afternoon so you could enjoy sun set and why not enjoy something elseYou need to pay to get to the top which I would recommend to do it but if you're looking to jump higher you have to visit Lotte Tower ... 555m"
221,3.0,"Went June 2018.  Walked up the 800 or so steps - thought the views might be worth it.  Not worth it. Recommend taking the cable car.  We paid the cable car one way for going down. They do pack the cable car tight with people. The city view is nice.  Nothing to brag about.  If you're on a romance trip and want to do the love lock thing, it's nice.  Otherwise, go if you have plenty of time."
222,5.0,"We didn't plan on visiting the tower that day. We got lost and found ourselves going that way.  We sure did a lot of walking up hills that day, including up the steps to the cable cars level as the elevator car wasn't working when we first got there. However, the views were worth every step.  Walk 360 degrees around the viewing area and be amazed. The view from the women's bathroom wasn't too bad either."
223,5.0,"During the day, you get a great view of Seoul.  The night view is also amazing.  Any tourist must add this to your places to visit."
224,5.0,This is my favorite. The love lock is so nice to visit. Cool place and and when you look around you will see very nice korea.
225,5.0,We opted for the paid entrance online. But we found out you dont really need to go to the observatory deck to see the seoul skyline.Theres a portion below the tower which overlooks the city already. I would say that was equally satisfying already. I wouldnt have paid if I knew about it.Efficient eay to get there is via bus.Refer to the photo I took from the “free” view
226,5.0,"Enjoyed the cable ride up to the tower, it was a cloudy and wet day, so the views we enjoyed from up were not that great. There is a hanbok rental and photoshoot place at the tower, as also Hello Kitty Museum and another kids museum - both small but good to keep kids excited. There are cafes too."
227,4.0,"There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities, and visiting their ""tallest buildings"" is one of them. But this was truly a nice experience. From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world!  They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute."
228,5.0,"The tower is very nice and surrounded by cafes, shops and places to just sit and relax if you don't want to go up. If you do go up, you get a 360 degree view of all of Seoul and the surrounding cities. It is mind boggling how many buildings there are here. The bathrooms in the tower are also amazing as they look out on the view!"
229,5.0,"This is a magical place esp for couple although i travelled with my daughter.  We enjoyed our stay here for free.  From chungmuro station there is bus no.5 or 2 as recommended by locals , it was easy to see the yellow bus , just look at the bus map if there is no.5 or 2 is passing by.  We didnt pick a tour since we have a tight budget. The view here is so relaxing, it was summer but a little bit cold during late afternoon.  We are looking forward for sunset but it was cloudy so we didnt really see it, too bad huh.  Better bring your own love locks as it was 9$ there but it was too pretty and has vibrant colors."
230,4.0,Its a nice place with interesting things to do. The journey there is also just as interesting. The view from the tower and from the bottom of the tower is good and nice.
231,4.0,"N Seoul Tower is quite OK, but the view is amazing and it was a bit hazy today,the view could have been better (in my opinion). My kid thinks there is nothing much, but we agree that the love locks are interesting, with some dating back to 2006.Overall, a good experience. Might come again."
232,4.0,It's a breathtaking view from N seoul Tower. The place is really awesome overlooking Seoul City. It's really a great view from tower. You will surely appreciate the view especially at night!!
233,4.0,"The N Seoul Tower can be accessed in many different ways. I took the faster hike, and it took about 20-30 mins to complete until I reached the top. The restaurant options vary from burgers, to korean, and asian fusion. I ate at the Owl's Cutlet (Asian Fusion), and it was very tasty. ( the prices were very reasonable ). Would recommend visiting if you are interested is seeing a 360 view of Seoul."
234,4.0,Beautiful view of the whole city at night and have a few paid attractions in the base area as well. Nice place to spend an evening with.
235,4.0,"This is one of the most listed must visit attraction in Seoul. I'd say it is worth the time and energy if you love cityscape because it is really beautiful from above. Other than that, they have an indoor photo studio with hanbok rental, which you can wear outside the studio for several hours, some museums (I went to a Hello Kitty one and it was cute!) and restaurants and cafes, also gift shops. The only thing bothering me is that there's not much option to get there, as you need to pay for a cable car OR hike your way through the hill. I don't recommend the hiking option, it's really really far and not worth your time and energy (except if you live there, maybe you want to ""kill some time"" or exercise). Cars with diplomatic license number can go through and park in the tower area though."
236,4.0,"If you are looking to see the city so you just got the place for..The view over the city is very nice, but have a look at the weather channel before you got on line for the ticket..."
237,5.0,"Definitely a place to visit when you in Seoul, the view from above is just great, recommended to visit👍🏻"
238,4.0,We visited at night.  Nice to see the whole city with lights. Its little bit expensive to go up but its worthy.
239,5.0,Great location to view the Seoul city. You will be amaze of the love locks there. You can also rent hanbok
240,4.0,"Great view up there. I think it's better at night, We had our private tour guide and he wanted to do everything in the morning lol. Try to visit this place when you are in Seoul."
241,5.0,a good  and must place to go in seoul. plenty of activities with surveniour to bring home. a lot of visitor but very lifely. public rest area with good house keeping. braveo to the korean. your country is very clean and polite people.
242,5.0,"The scenic view made it less tiring to climb the steep road to the tower.  When you get there, there's so many things to do and to look at  besides the tower itself.  You would not mind the crowd because I think it's better when there's a lot of people around."
243,4.0,"We visited N Seoul Tower a.k.a Namsan tower on our last day in Seoul. since we were in myeongdong we decided to pay a visit since it’s within the area. If you want to ride a cable car, You can actually walk going there from myeongdong exit 6 or use naver map to navigate walking a little uphill but manageable. it’s pretty near. or hop on a shuttle bus going directly to the tower if you want to skip the cable car. but cost you a bit. You can pay thru T-Money card around 1,250-1,300 won. Bus 02 and 05 at bus station near subway. We opt to ride in cable car, and that’s my biggest regret, it’s a waste of money, trust me. We went there around 5:30pm but since the line is wayyyy too long, we hop on cable car by 7pm. If you want to ride a cable car it’s advisable to catch by day because at night you won’t be able to see the nature’s view, unless you prefer to see the lights of the tower which is okay at night. well, for me anytime of the day is not good. because, the cable car itself was not pretty good to ride. No seat. It’s not private where you and your family can enjoy, its not even romantic. it’s basically public transfer to tower, with lots of people inside and when I mean lots, I mean it will transfer people within the limit capacity, I think 20-25 person inside. I thought it’s like in Singapore where you can privately have your own cable car and enjoy the view with family, or can be even romantic with loved ones. This one was not. We didn’t enjoy at all and it’s just a waste of money.  Roundtrip is 8,500 won/person. We can’t even move. Seriously, if we were knew the situation inside, we were not opt to ride the cable car. If you are energetic and wants to explore the Namsan Park, you can walk from Myeongdong all the way to the tower as there is park nearby the tower. Pretty cool to have pictures there specially on cherry blossoms day.  Worth the walk, some of my friends opt for walking. And we opt for a cable. Just too know the difference.The tower: observation deck is overrated for me, there’s not much to do there, from our experience, you pay for the ticket, you have to fall in line that is waaayyyyy too long as well, stand on a photo booth, so you can have your photoshopped at tower where’s there’s another fee for 15,000 won per picture (optional) you enter elevator going up top, and voila you just have to sit on floor or not or stand up, and just take a look down there to view the skyline buildings. If you want to view from a telescope there’s another fee 500 won. We didn’t enjoy the observation as well, aside from mini souvenir station and a candy store, there’s not much to do there, and with lots of people blocking the window glass, you can have a spot for picture. Actually even there’s not much people there you can’t even have a decent photo there, the lights are dimmed there. That’s it. Unless you have a high resolution video and a good skill of photo and video editing, you can enjoy that, or you’re a lovers of some kind, and wants to waste time mingling with each other while looking at the view it’s fine too. But for us, it’s a waste of time and money for tickets. We’d rather enjoy outside the tower taking free pictures with all the Lovelocks spots, and cool climate, or going and enjoy other attractions there like hello kitty, ssentoy, and teddy bear museums. There’s plenty of restaurants on tower but too pricey for their food. Don’t even buy it. Find decent meal at Myeongdong its way better there. The food in Namsan doesn’t have quality. We will come back there, on a day but never to ride the cable and visit observation deck. N Seoul tower is pretty much for taking photos outside and nice conversation with a very good climate. That’s all."
244,3.0,nice view from above we used the cable car all the way and the place was full of tourists. The view of the locks all over the fence was colorful and so beautiful
245,3.0,"We went up there just before the sunset, it's really a nice view during sunset.  The blossom is really beautiful up there.  The overlook of Seoul is really beautiful and romantic during sunset.We took a circular bus up to N Seoul Tower.  It's more convenient if you are going with elderly as you can take the bus from a few metro station exit like Seoul Station and Myeong-dong Station.  So you don't have to walk a lot and a much cheaper and convenient  way to get to the tower."
246,5.0,"The first time I came here, it was daytime, and it was fine, but when I came back at night, I loved it. It's a beautiful view, and there are fun museums and food places, too."
247,5.0,"Love the Seoul tower!!! I came here to check out the lovelocks areas, as seen on Korean drama “My Love from the Stars”. Taxi took us to the cable car station. The cable car took us to the Seoul tower area. You will see nice view of Seoul. There is a couple of restaurants, gift shop. We did not go to the top tower, the fee was pricey but just the park areas alone you can appreciate fantastic views."
248,2.0,"Visited this so-called Seoul tower but it was not impressive as it was just too low to offer a good view of Seoul skyline. The lift just took 5 minutes to reach the viewing deck. I hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level. To make matter worse, the attendants could not speak English when i asked for direction to get down from the tower. So, don’t expect too much from this dwarf tower,"
249,5.0,We walk up and took the cable car down from Namsan Tower.We visited the observatory deck and enjoyed the view.
250,5.0,Very cool view !   Can hike to too if you have the stamina or take a round trip / one way cable car .But a love lock to make sure you leave it behind with a message for the city ! Really cool
251,4.0,"Need to walk up hill about 15 min from Myeongdong to take cable car. A bit tiring If you are with kid. Anyhow, the view is nice and we had relaxing time spent there."
252,3.0,We visited n tower todayThe place is magnificentYou can reach by two ways ! Either the bus or the cable carWe have reached using the cable car which was a bit hard traveling with a toddler and a strollerTo reach the cable car u have to ride a veichel up to cable carTickets are for both 1 or two waysAdult round trip = 8500Children under 3 are entering for freeOnce you reach the cable car you need to fold your kid’s strolled !Ride it and then carry it for a very long stairs ! Along with your toddler or baby ! As access for  wheel chairs and strollers are not available which is really disappointed We didn’t actually get into the tower  We spent the time around the plaza Which is consisting of 5 stories I have seen some restaurants with nice viewWe were actually looking for the park but not able to reach it as google map services in Korea is so bad and you can not reach using the walking option !
253,5.0,I don't have a boyfriend .. but who say we can't came here if we don't have a boyfriend isn't it .. we also can take a picture with all the love lock here .. and i love this place so much ..
254,3.0,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly."
255,3.0,"We went to N Seoul Tower after our palace trip. I can honestly say that the place is over-rated. They have this area where couples can put locks and write something on the locks, i guess a wish that the relationship lasts long. Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers. But we went anywhere...went for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow. Still worth a go but again is a little over-rated. And the locks being sold on-site costs between 6500-8500w!!! A little pricey"
256,5.0,"A great place to visit at night. We went to 5th floor for observation deck only. The admission fee is KRW 10,000.00 but we booked thru klook where it more cheaper. We went there by bus where you may take subway line 3, Dongguk University Station, Exit 6, take the bus 02/03/05 (Fee is KRW 1,200.00 by cash or KRW 1,100.00 by T-money card).What impressed me was you can have a view in restroom as well which is also called as sky restroom."
257,4.0,"A breathtaking view overlooking the city of Seoul. There is a show about Korean warriors on top of Level 5, which is not to be missed."
258,5.0,We loved our visit to this tower at night. The expansive lights of Seoul are amazing. The tower is fun and easy to visit. It's definitely touristy but worth it for the view. The cable car didn't seem to be running when we went and we got confused about which bus to take so we ended up walking up the tower. It was about a 30 minute walk uphill but it was not hard at all.
259,4.0,"You could either go here by walking or using the cable car which costs around 8000 won for round trip. It's actually free to roam around the place and look over seoul, if you have enough budget and money to spend you could avail the 10000 won access to the top. Is it worth it? Yes, for the view but if you have a lot of children avoid. When you get to the viewing deck you have elevator access but upon exit you have to go one floor down and you have to carry everything. Imagine. When you're a large group I suggest you keep that  money for food."
260,5.0,"It was a difficult journey going to N Seoul Tower from our guesthouse. But nonetheless the ""trekking"" we did was worth it as we see Seoul by night and mesmerized on how people believe about forever by having love locks (like the one in Paris...hoping and praying it soon)"
261,3.0,"I purchased the tickets from kkday website, with a little bit of discount. We get there by cable car which is fast and better than walking that long path to the tower. Abit crowded inside the tower. You may see the full view of Seoul but I guess it will look beautiful at night. Restaurants are available inside."
262,5.0,This 360 degree view of the city should not be missed. We were dropped off near the top by our tour bus and walked up the last section to the tower. Views on all sides are spectacular and give you a sense of the size and scope of the city. You can even see some of the old city wall. There is a cable car available but on the sunny Sunday we were there was at least an hour wait. You can also hike up to the top but we didn't have enough time to do this either.
263,4.0,"There was a huge line to go up there on the holiday weekend and then no line at all on Tuesday night. The views from the observation deck are amazing. The colors of the tower at night, very cool. Not sure about the food up there, we didn't go to the restaurant. You can walk to the base but it's a bit of a climb. Better to take a taxi up there and then walk back down afterward and stroll through Meyongdong."
264,4.0,"If you are planning to go here make sure to anticipate at least 3 hours by the time you get through the cue for the cable car and the lineup for the tower.  A lot of walking and stairs so would be difficult for the elderly and with a stroller, they do have elevators but still quite a hike.  We went at night and it was very beautiful"
265,5.0,"Great for the whole family. Especially when you have little kids, they will enjoy the activities in store there."
266,4.0,"We went to the top via cable but it is nothing spectacular. If you can walk, the experience will be much better and the view is great. We didn't go to the actual tower but just hang around the bottom around where the love locks are, ended up reading the messages left. It was a great experience and overall, unexpected"
267,4.0,We were surprised how interesting this was. The 123 restaurant was pleasant and in crowded and provided a spectacular sunset.
268,4.0,"This is the place you should start your stay in Seoul. Get a touristmap orient you self on the map, make a plan for what and where you want to go during your stay and bring with you this map and plan during your visit in the twr. Its great to walk through the city when you go to the twr since you can see the twr from aømost everywhere. The place it self is a bit crowded and a lot of candy and other stuff to buy. Take the cablecar down, toward west, and visit mayongdong shopping/ market area, Its about 5-10 minutes walk downhill from the cablecar stop. If you have time it is a nice walk up to the twr."
269,4.0,"We didnt take the cable.car to the tower we hiked. It took us about 1.5 hours to reach the top with young children. Once there at the tower, you can shop or eat. Also one of the levels of the tower has the oocks of love walls/ trees. Dont worry if you forget your lock they do sell them there for a decent price. There is also a hello kitty plac there were you can walk in the oife of hello kitty!"
270,4.0,"If you're lucky enough to get a clear day, this place is amazing. You can see EVERYTHING. If it's hazy or the dust is extremely bad, it might not be as impressive. Either way, the park is nice, the entrance fee is very reasonable, and the crowds are not too bad.Just one thing---parents, be warned! There is a candy shop on the observation deck. Your children WILL want candy. 😁"
271,5.0,"We came from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower by subway and took the bus no. 2 to tower. Weather was very cold, good view."
272,3.0,"This was neat, but we live in Seattle and it was very Space Needle like. The ride to get up there was forever long and that's just to the base of the tower. I'd recommend this as a novelty, but beware of the crazy, business of this place!"
273,3.0,"Good view of the city.  Although it is open year round, avoid it on a holiday. We had a 40 minute wait for the cable car.  8500 for round trip cable car and another 10000 to ride to the top of the tower.  Several food choices at the base of the tower and all the way up too.  Can also walk up to the tower if you are feeling energetic."
274,5.0,We went there around 4 o’clock in the afternoon and walked up the hill ( did not take the elevator). The views were great from that location and so the pictures were good as well. My son was enamored by the chain link fence complete with “ love locks”. By the time we went up in the elevator to the tower the sun was setting which was perfect timing for pictures!!
275,5.0,We were lucky as it was snowing when we visited the N Seoul Tower. We took the shuttle bus from Myeongdong and walked to to Tower. Beautiful and breathtaking views.
276,5.0,From myeongdong shopping street you can take a walk to the lift near highway gate. To reach the Namsan Seoul tower you should take the tram. Up at the N Tower you can can city wall from joseon and see beautiful scenery from top of it.
277,5.0,"N Seoul tower is famous for tourist sight.try to go there by cable car, and you'll get amazing view of Seoul ( IF the weather good)."
278,5.0,"There were a few museums in the tower, such as toy museum and hellp kitty museum providing lots of photo opportunities. The building lights up at night and provides a nice view of the city. The lift up take only 1 minute and there will be a show on the way up and down. There are candy shops and souvenir shops at the viewing gallery."
279,4.0,"You need to take a cable car to reach the top of the tower.Some people hike but we found the cable car most convenient as we were travelling with an infant. No baby changing place at the tower. However when I requested a place to feed my baby, the staff were very helpful and provided us their office room to feed.The tower does provide some good views. Remember to visit the washroom at the top of the tower. They have floor to ceiling windows with amazing views while you do your thing :D"
280,5.0,"There are 3 ways to go to this tower: by walking, using Namsan Circular bus, or using cable car. We chose the third one to go to the Tower and the second one to go back to Myeongdong. We visited this place on Saturday morning. From Myeongdong, we just walked to the intersection near Namdaemun n Myeongdong. We took Namsan Oreumi and arrived at Cable Car station. We took one way tickets (6,000 won for adults and 3,500 for kids). It was around 10.30 a.m and there was no queue on Cable Car. We visited N Seoul Plaza and found out that that Plaza had a lot of cute animals' characters. If you have children, we suggest you to visit this Plaza."
281,2.0,From Myeongdong you can walk to the N Seoul cable car station. It takes about 15 -20 mins walk. We didn't make it to the top as the queues at the cable car station was madly insane. It probably going to takes us 2 hours just to ride on the cable car.
282,4.0,It is also known as Namasan tower and located on one of the the highest land in Seoul and is visible from most of city.  It can only be reached by public bus or a hike up the steep landscape.  We enjoyed the view of the city and beyond once on top of the viewing platform.  There are a number of small cafe/restaurant located within the complex where we enjoyed some food and beer.  Definitely a place to visit in Seoul
283,4.0,"Nothing much to see. Easy to get there by bus. Go there at night. Only candy stores and souvenir shops on the viewing deck. Although, it's nice if you want a view of Seoul."
284,5.0,"You get a great feeling about Seoul, nice to be there for sunset especially for romantic dates. You can walk up from Grand Hyatt hotel through the park so that you earn your drink and food at the top. You can book a dinner at the revolving restaurant - recommended to do in advance or simply go up the tower, enjoy the view and have a drink downstairs with still a great view. Please note, sunset times might be a bit more busy. Come when it is still light so you get the best of both. Don‘t forget to use the toiletts or to check it out on the top of the tower - they are with a view.Enjoy"
285,5.0,"This is near Myeong-Dong shopping area. From the biggest Uniqlo store, just go straight and cross the street (by going down the subway) and then walk straight. It's kind of an uphill so walk at your own risk. You can also take the cab directly to the entrance of the tower, it was I think 6000 won from Myeong-Dong. We took the cable car (price can be seen at their website). There's love locks everywhere! They sell the locks for 5000-7000 won so might as well lock the love ;) We were surprised that there's a separate ticket for the observatory so we just stayed downstairs. There's a coffee shop, souvenir shop and Olive Young beside the ticket booth. Would love to go back once I find The One!"
286,4.0,"You can take in the 360 view of Seoul from the Tower.  See Gangnam, the new Lotte Tower and the Han River."
287,5.0,Easily accessible by mini elevator car up and then there is a main cable car ride up to the Tower. You can buy locks at the stores itself and join e thousands who have locked theirs on the fences around the tower. Good photo spot and there is a mini toy museum and restaurants to eat. Queues were fast moving on Xmas Day.
288,5.0,"Finally on my 3rd visit to South Korea, I managed to visit the Namsan Tower. I went on a private tour and able to skip the cable car visit and went up by tour van instead. Love it! Too bad the city view was foggy when I visited but I still like the place."
289,5.0,Visited the Seoul Tower in the night. Nice view of the city with lights on the buildings. Took a picture with the tower in the background. Also taste the ice cream there. Overall a nice experience.
290,4.0,"Walking through Namsan Park will lead you to N Seoul Tower. Alternatively, you can take a cable car from Namsan Cable Car Station. N Seoul Tower is a must to visit during your visit to Seoul. You can enjoy the view of Seoul vividly from the Tower which need to pay an entrance fee. There are also restaurants and some cafe that you can enjoy a cup of coffee enjoying the view."
291,5.0,"We were lucky to get dropped off at N Tower by AJay of Ultimate Korea Tour, and then he picked us up after we took the cable car ride down.  The top of N Tower has great views, and of course, fun to leave a heart on the fence of Love Locks.  You can buy a heart lock at the stores up there, then write on your lock the date and your name and where you are from, then lock it onto the fence.  It's also fun to get your picture taken in front of a green screen, then choose the background pic.  You can also buy a postcard that includes a stamp, and mail it from N Tower - very convenient!"
292,4.0,"The instructions online to get to the cable car station wasn’t clear so we kind of got lost a few times while hunting for the station. We saw a few others getting lost too:(However, cos it snowed the previous day, the fortress wall looked beautiful with the snow on them. View of the nearby mountains from the top was beautiful! There was some traditional martial arts performance at the peak too when we were there and my son enjoyed it a lot."
293,5.0,"We took a short tram ride up to the N. Seoul Tower. You pay to do this and then pay again to go up into the tower. Kind of a pricey tourist visit but worth it when you get up into the tower and get a 360 degree view of Seoul. There are restaurants, a candy store and lots of things for children to do. We really enjoyed this site."
294,4.0,"Took a cab up to the cable station. you can climb and hike, if you have strong legs and energy. But personally it would be dreading as i see the steps were steep. Cable car ride was nice. I think we enjoyed the cable car most.Up at Namsan, the view was breathtaking.Its a place to take lots of pictures, and getting a lock was not necessary for me.There are cafes, place to sit and place to play( claw machine)."
