0,3.0,"A lot of halal restaurants nearby. But this place has nothing to offer for travelers seeking for something Korean. It gives a nice view of Seoul, but not worth that much to walk up the hill to get here, if you are not a muslim."
1,5.0,"I used to live in seoul for 5 years (2008-2013), this is the place that i frequently came for friday prayersNice place but need some toilet renovation"
2,5.0,"I arrived on Friday and the mosque was filled with people ready to perform Friday prayer. There was prayer mats outside for those who couldn't fit inside the main prayer hall. The women's prayer room is a little hidden away.  Along the streets leading to the mosque, you will find many halal restaurants (including korean halal cuisine), kebabs counters, and a halal supermarket."
3,3.0,Its abt 10-15 mins walk from Itaewon station exit 3.. it is at uphill. So best to wear ur most comfortable shoes here. Halal restaurants and halal groceries shops nearby.. but the streets nearby can be quite quiet.. was here in the early afternoon..
4,5.0,"This is a beautiful mosque that is kind of hidden in Itaewon. It's not on the street. You have to walk in a big gate decorated with Islamic art and then go uphill a little bit to see it.What's baffling (and funny, actually) is that there is a red light district (and it's very red) literally 1-2 min walk away from this mosque. Whichever was there first, their presence next to each other is contradictory (unless I'm missing something). It's kinda like seeing a criminal hideout next to the central police station. Unless if the police was corrupt, then that would explain it, but... Who knows?"

6,3.0,Mosque in Seoul for the Muslim community and individual worshipper in Seoul.  It is in Itaewon; a harmonious blend of different ethnic community.

8,4.0,"The sight of the minarets at the top of the hill gave me two very different feelings. The first was delight at seeing something so welcoming among the endless skyline of Christian crosses topping the churches of South Korea. The second was the challenge of the climb up after an already long day of walking and navigating the public transit systems of this mega-city.There is a large diagram in the entry gate area that directs Muslims to their gender appropriate ablution areas and also contains information for the non-Muslim visitors to allow them to visit both respectfully and comfortably.The women's prayer room is a little hidden away both to find in the first place and then in its setting relative to the men's prayer room, which has a wide and obvious entryway. The stairs to the third floor are not well marked. Once inside the hallway the welcome signs fall away to multiple requests to remove one's shoes and a scattering of shower shoes clutter the floor. However, once upstairs the balcony prayer area is nice. Heavily carpeted with a low wall that allows a view of the main prayer room below, it is clean, quiet, well ventilated, and provides many additional supportive materials like prayer rugs and head scarves.It was well worth the climb up the hill."
9,5.0,"Well this is the  best tourist attraction in seoul. People from all religions, colour, sex, countries visit this sacred place and they are all warmly welcomed. It is a worth visit place, as you will feel peace and repose."
