0,4.0,"Visited this place because my companion are kdrama addict, it's walking distance from the train station, you might get confuse so keep on asking. You can take pictures outside the hall and nothing more. But if you are not fond of kdrama don't bother to visit this place."
1,2.0,"I love Korean dramas but when I was there, we kinda got to the main building instead of this one. The security and information peeps at the desk were quite rude. Didn't really direct us on where this building is. Anywhoooo....The building itself wasn't fun at all. Yes you can do the anchor news, yes you can do the dubbing of cartoons, but it's only fun for a few minutes. There's really nothing there. There's really not much to offer. It is free so it's not a waste of money, but for me, it was a waste of time. Regretted going there."
2,5.0,free admission. but literally nothing to do here besides taking pictures and pretending you're anchor in their studio. the only interesting place is that you can see radio broadcast (from outside) below the kbs on building. the radio dj is usually announcer or singer. but my main goal is to take picture in the famous 2D1N opening scene stairs
