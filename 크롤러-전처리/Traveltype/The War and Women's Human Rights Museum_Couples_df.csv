0,5.0,"I came here with my girlfriend and we were stunned by this museum. It is a truly eye opening experience not only to the past but what is still happening in present day. They give you an audioguide, which is very helpful as most of the displays are in Korean. As well as being very educational and informative, the museum gives you the opportunity to donate to help fight for the end of sexual slavery and for the freedom of the women who have been affected.Anyone and everyone should go to this museum, and appreciate the bravery of the women who have stepped forward and shared their stories."
1,5.0,"This is one of the most powerful exhibitions I have been to. If you are in Hongdae, please spare some time and visit this museum. This could be one of the most meaningful activities of your trip.I coincidentally saw the name of this museum in Hongik University station signage. After knowing that this museum is dedicated to ""comfort women"" and that it is part of the movement for fighting for protection of women and children in war conflicts, we went there on the next day. This museum is located at an alley, not the main road. It may be easier to go there by bus than by subway. (Citymapper gives very clear directions.) The museum (as well as its entrance) was modest, but the ""yellow butterflies"" led us there. The English speaking staff member was very kind and helpful. After paying the 3,000 won admission fee, we were given the audio guide. The audio guide was very important since there was barely any English illustration about the exhibit. The audio illustration also created the right mood and tempo of our visit. While we were shocked and moved by different exhibits and images, we were impressed by the special exhibition at the basement, like the epilogue of the tour. We were glad that this museum is not a very sensational and nationalistic one that promotes hatred but one that encourages reflection.If you happen to be in Hongdae or in Seoul, please don't hesitate to go and pay tribute to these brave women."

Their dignity and fortitude in the face of this ongoing denial of their suffering is inspiring, as is their work to reach out to other affected women world wide. We also went to the Wednesday protest, where we were welcomed warmly. My only small issue is that the audio guide told us to listen to videos which were only in Korean. If they could translate the videos to English, that would be great."
3,5.0,"Surprising on many levels, the museum is located in a hard-to-find side street relatively far from the city centre having been initially granted and subsequently blocked from a site within the Independence Park as it was deemed an inappropriate location by some. The museum is remarkably discreet from the outside, the main entrance could be mistaken for a side door, however a wall covered in paper butterflies with hand-written messages from past visitors gives it away. A surprising amount of the museum is dedicated to evidence that the atrocities happened at all: diaries, maps, photos - simple but clear indicators which are then followed by the Japanese government denials and subsequent legal cases. The story is hard. The outcome of their struggle for recognition remains uncertain. It is a deeply engaging place which is worth the trip. There is English language captioning on each exhibit but it is somewhat limited in content.  If you have the opportunity to go with someone who can read the Korean text it will add a lot."
