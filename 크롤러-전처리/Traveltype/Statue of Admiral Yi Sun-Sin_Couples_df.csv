0,4.0,One of the two statues in this square. The square and statues can be found right infront of the palace. Good for some quick photos.
1,5.0,"I had never heard of this famous 16th-century Korean admiral until I visited Gwanghwamum Plaza, where his bronze statue anchors its southern end. But now I know that Admiral Yi Sun-Sin has a fascinating background, including incredible military achievements during the Imjin War (1592-96) when he defended Korea against Japanese invaders. Yi Sun-Sin invented the ironclad ""turtle"" ship. It was so successful that it took only a few to win a battle with hundreds of the enemy's traditional ships.Sculptor Kim Se-jung's 1968 work depicts the war hero standing in armor, with a massive sword in the right hand. A miniature replica of the turtle ship appears just below the statue. The bronze and its high pedestal rise about 56 feet above the plaza. The 12:23 fountain nearby received its name from the 23 battles the admiral fought with 12 ships. It was not operating during my day visit in October, but I saw it in action with colored lights, passing by in a bus one night.As a history buff, I enjoyed the small museum under the plaza devoted to Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and King Sejong."
2,5.0,"Around the country we have discovered statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Si, here in Seoul and Busan, this sixteenth century naval commander is famous for the major part he played in defending the country from the Japanese.  The Admiral's bronze statue stands high on a pillar in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square, at the foot of the pillar is a model Turtle Ship, with his back to the Bukaksan Mountain and Gyeongbokgung Palace. One of the Admiral's greatest achievements was bringing back turtle ships into use and improving the design and function."
3,4.0,"The 17 m bronze statue stands in Gwanghwamun Square and in front of it there are many small water fountains that go up and down ( a favorite place for children to play in the water). The admiral was a famous hero who made his name by fighting the Japanese in the 16th century. In front of the statue tents have been erected and this seems to be the place to draw attention to various causes, such as the sinking of a Korean ship by the north."
4,5.0,"You can't miss it, and I am not sure how you can complain when it is a free attraction. As far as the ""tent city"" is concerned, there was a ferry disaster in 2014 in which 304 passengers, most of which were high school students, died. This tent city as some call is is in response to that and actually part of the effort to memorialize the incident, seeing as how the statue is of a Mariner it was the appropriate place to set it up in an attempt to call the coast guard out for it's lack of response at the time. Out of the 172 survivors, only 30 or so were saved by the coast guard itself, fishing boats provided the majority of the rescue effort."
5,3.0,"We found this statue in Gwanghwamun square, together with the statue of King Sejong. This is a respected historical figure and the statue is prominent and iconic.Good for a quick visit."
6,4.0,"Straight outside Gyeongbokgung palace, it was interesting to see this statue dedicated to such a historical figure who can be found on W1000 note. There is an information board and it makes a great photo.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
7,5.0,Once you are done with the palace. Go down the main square to see the shops and the statue. There are some floor fountain around the statue were kid would be playing. It is fun to see or if you wanna join them
8,3.0,Another statue on the main street. If you are around go to see it. Near all important locations. A statue of an important admiral in the history of Korea.
9,5.0,"Just by standing next to this statue I can get a feeling of all the important historical events that it has witnessed. Against all the hardships it is still unconquerably standing in the heart of the city, reminding its citizens of their roots and past glories. Every capital needs a symbol like this and a hero that manifests all those attributes that are important to them as a culture. Personally it's one of my favourite places in Seoul. It's always fascinating to remember where it's all started."
10,5.0,"Located in the center of a busy street in Seoul. Hard to miss! Yi Sun-sin was a Korean naval commander, famed for his victories against the Japanese navy during the Imjin war in the Joseon Dynasty."
11,4.0,"This statue is very imposing and beautiful. It depicts a very important historical figure in Korea, Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. The history of the admiral's accomplishments is impressive. It is worth a 20-30 minute walk around the square to admire the statue and see kids playing in the fountain nearby."
12,5.0,It's close to many other tourist attractions. It's a great place to take a pic that you'll treasure.
13,3.0,"One may say this statue is the most famous statue in South Korea.  It really anchors the Gwanghwamun plaza and the entire district.  It is a good example of a national monument, but nothing more.  However, often at the feet of the statue there can be political protest or other temporary exhibitions.  And on hot summer days, when protestors are somehow absent, there is a plaza water fountain that kids love to play in."
14,5.0,"This is a towering statue in Gwanghwamun Square, near the statue of Sejung the Great King and Gyeongbokgung Palace.  It's easily accessible by subway (line 5 - purple).The Admiral looks fierce, and there is also a model of the type of boat he used to fend off the Japanese.  Nearby is an underground display of his story, along with the story of Sejong the Great King.Be impressed!"
15,4.0,"This statue of the man responsible for creating Korean currency is located near palaces, as well as art and history museums, so try to work it into your visit to the neighborhood. Like some of the palaces, it's lit up at night, so you might want to take a photo around dinner time. When I visited there was a memorial in front dedicated to the students who died in the tragic ferry incident."
16,4.0,Read about Admiral Yi Sun Sin and take some time to walk along Gwanghwamun Square. Nice a a couple of picture.
17,3.0,"One of the interesting things you will see at Gwanghwamun Square is the bronze statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, erected here in 1968.  This 17 metre tall statue is of of the admiral in war attire, grasping a sward in his hand, it is a symbol position of protection over his beloved Korea.   This is a neat statue to see if you are interested in this historical figure and Korean history. If you want to learn more about Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, it is also well worth your time visiting 'The Story of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin' attraction which shares underground space with the similar 'The Story of King Sejong' here at Gwanghwamun Square."
18,4.0,"Before coming to this place, read about Admiral Sun-Yi; a very memorable and heroic character of Korean Empire. They even made a movie about him a couple of years ago. Recommended to see on your way to Seoul's forbidden city."
19,4.0,Impressive statue on Gwanghwamun Square dedicated to korean admiral who managed to beat the mighty Japanese fleet.
20,3.0,"This statue commemorates the Korean Naval commander who defeated the Japanese in several key naval battles in the past. One of two grand statues at Gwanghwamun Square, the other being King Sejong the Great."
21,4.0,"While the statue is pretty awesome, be sure to check out the underground museum!  I didn't know much of the Naval history of Korea - but after spending some time here, Admiral Yi quickly became a historical leader I want to learn more about!  This man was a genius."
22,3.0,"I really think the statue is not special in any way although I agree with others that it provides for an excuse to learn more about korean history. The square though is nice and if you look north you can see the palace and the other statues that line up Gwanghwamun square. Go south from here to get to Cheonggyecheon, the stream that runs through a modern part of town."
23,4.0,"The Admiral Yi Sun Shin statue placed in the center of Gwanghwamun Square from here you can admire the statues placed in sequence in the middle of the main wide square, the beautiful fountain, the Gwanghwamun Gate and the beautiful buildings that surround the square, in short, one of the places not to be missed city​​, accessible by metro station just a short walk distance from here."
24,3.0,"I don't want to disrespect the history and or what Admiral Yi Sun Shin represents to South Korea, but from a tourist standpoint you wouldn't miss much if you did not see it during your visit to Seoul. In all fairness, I did not go at night to see it and it might have been way cooler to see it then. During the day, it's just another statue in a crowded tourist area. If you're in the area, you should check it out, if not, you're not missing much. Cheers!"
