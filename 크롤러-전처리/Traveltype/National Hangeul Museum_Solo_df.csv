0,5.0,About 5 mins walk from National Museum of Korea. Korean people are very proud of their language.  The writing system called Hangeul was invited in the 15th century and is considered one of the most phonologically faithful writing systems in use today.
1,3.0,"It is a really beautiful museum and relatively small museum, which will take about 1 hour to go through. It teaches about Hangeul, the Korean writing system. You can learn about history, usage, and a lot more. However, most of the Information is provided in Korean only. A few texts have been translated, which makes it still worth going there, but it will only briefly explain."
2,4.0,"Just a short walk from the National Museum (reviewed previously) this is worth a visit to add to your understanding of the very unique written Korean language. Admission is free and budget about an hour.First floor outlines the history and structure of the language. Until this alphabet was introduced the Korean language writing was represented by Chinese characters, thus limiting writing and reading to an elite few.To find out the rest of the history I suggest you go visit.Second floor is a historical collection of dictionaries.Plenty of English explanation.Only disappointment was the fact the gift shop did not stock anything meaningful to buy. Also has a cafe serving cake and coffee"

4,5.0,This museum is dedicated to the Korean language.  This is the only place I have been where the language of a Nation gets it's own museum.  Quite interesting and worth the time.  Conveniently located near the Korean history museum.
5,5.0,This is the place to learn how the Korean alphabets came about. Located at level 2.The place is almost opposite to the National Museum of Korea. And both are easily reached at the Ichon train station. Just walk. The directions will bring you here very easily.There is no admission fee.
6,3.0,"Recently I spent about 90 minutes browsing the Hangeul museum. Though the building and interior of the museum are very impressive, clean, modern and pleasant I thought the museum content could have been presented better to English speakers. Though I'm very interested in Korean culture and the alphabet/language, I thought the museum exhibits were quite boring and uninformative. Both the permanent and special exhibits had very little signage in English. Also, I opted to take the English audio tour on a headset, but it wasn't very helpful because very few displays were included in the recording. I will likely return to the museum after I've made progress learning to read Hangul and hope to have a better experience then. I was asked by the staff to complete a survey for foreigners after my visit, so it's nice to know the museum is open to suggestions. Otherwise, I enjoyed the ambience of the museum and thought the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Finally, I would recommend the museum to people with children ages 3 to 9, as there is a very nice children's section of the museum with an indoor playground and cute activities."
7,4.0,"This is a interesting museum well worth a visit whilst visiting The National Museum of Korea. It is located next door and gives  you and insight into the origin and fundamentals of the Hangeul script.  Many of the displays and videos have English explanations.  Unfortunately, most information sheets that are free to take have no English explanation but don't let that deter you."
8,3.0,This museum will only interest you if you speak Korean or are interested in the Korean language. Free to enter. The first floor has the history of the language with a small display on the second floor on the use of the language in advertising.
9,4.0,"This museum is dedicated to the Korean language and the written script of Hangeul.  As a non-Hangeul speaker, I found this museum to be surprisingly educational.  I learned a lot about written script and sound placement.  This museum is free to the public."
