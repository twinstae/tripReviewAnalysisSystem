0,4.0,"Another must visit, allows for some cool photo souvenirs and is a real piece of the city’s vast history. I enjoyed my time there, though I wouldn’t spend hours. It’s close to Dongdaemun square, so can be combined with other activities..."
1,4.0,Found the walk by accident as I was doing an unplanned work through the city.The walk is old and follows a ridge line to protect the old city. It is broken in line meaning you can find the wall then loose it again as you walk it’s line.I did think the wall was in good condition and must have had further defences however now it’s just the wall.It’s not the Great Wall but just a barrier.
2,5.0,"Discovered the climb up to Naksan Park following the Seoul City Wall almost be accident.  Path starts just North of Dongdaemun Gate.  Walked up on the inside of the Wall (which provides the best views out over the city), then back down on the outside of the Wall (some good photo opportunities of the wall itself).  Take water (especially in Summer), a hat, good footwear and a camera.  Plenty of places to stop on the way up to Naksan Park (the track doubles as a fitness circuit, and there is plenty of shaded seating).  Path varies between paved and unpaved on the way up.  Not really suitable for small children."
3,3.0,"I was walking around Dongdaemun when I campe upon the city wall!! It was just right off Dongdaemun station, exit 1 I think. It was nice, so much history. Come here for a relaxing time and just cool off....so nice in the evening, and it was good to see."
4,5.0,"You have to visit this place if you come to South Korea. While most of the tourists go to Namsan Tower or Lotte Tower, you just need to climb up to this fortress to see the beauty of the city. Perfect place for a solo traveller like me. (Personally, I recommend 2 up to 3 hours to spend time here because i'm not a fan of history things)[You might want to look for the history first before visiting this place]Advice :1. Visit this place during the sunset and stay during the night and you will be fascinated by the night view of the Seoul2. This is the hidden part. If you come early, you might want to visit the famous Ihwa Mural Village first because it is not far from the Walls. Many K-Dramas have taken scenes here! (You won't find this information unless you travel with locals)"
5,5.0,"I finally accomplished my goal to follow the entire city wall trail in one day. If you do this, start early and bring plenty of water and snacks because there are not many places to get drinking water, especially on the northern and toughest part of the circle. Check the schedule, you can only visit the northern section during the daytime and not on Mondays. Check the excellent website for details about the hike. It took me about 12 hours with a few short rest breaks. I did the northern section first since it is the toughest one. You get great views of the city from different angles."
6,5.0,"This is an amazing city walls built around the old Seoul(Hanyang) in Joseon Dynasty. Even though most parts have been rebuilt over several decades, it's fun to visit.- Koreans at that time used to talk a walk and enjoy the view of city walls. And there's a guide map to feel it again today.- Among those city walls, Dongdaemun Seonggwak Park and Baekbeom Park(Baekbeom Square) are easy to access.- The city walls consist of several tracks which means it's not connected entirely. I think Naksan Park and Namsan Park are two most crowded tracks.- City walls are also built on mountains like Namsan, Inwangsan and Bugaksan. It may be a bit tough for seniors or young children.- There are four main gates and four small gates. Some of them are still remaining. Sungnyemun(Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun(Dongdaemun) are famous.- Some of them are good sunset points in Seoul. I recommend the top of Inwangsan Mountain."
7,4.0,Try to choose such a day with proper weather. Walk along the wall as much as you can. You will have nice views of the city. Worth visiting.
8,4.0,Make sure you walk up to the top as it will give you very beautiful view of the city. Worth the hike and time spent. Make sure to drop by at the museum too.
9,5.0,"I walked along the eastern and northern sections of this wall. It was brilliant. Note that you need to show picture ID for the northern part as it is sensitive and part of the defence system for the city. The northern part is better than the eastern part. There are superb views towards the mountains and the walk is through woods and is sheltered in many places.You can do a short section or a long section, up to you. Good for 1-8 hours or more if you have the time.Note that much of the wall's top sections have been rebuilt but it still looks impressive."
10,4.0,"Hiking the entire loop is a major undertaking, but well worth it on a beautiful day. The hike will allow you to see other areas of Seoul and even some local neighborhoods. You can also hike partial sections. You will need your passport to go through the Military area & no photos allowed there."
11,5.0,"I started off at Dongdaemun station, from where the path is very easy to find. After a while you can visit Ihwa village on the left-hand side, which is very recognisable when you lots of cafes and people with selfie-sticks. Once you've visited the highest point in Naksan Park, it's best to take the path on the right-hand side of the wall (I had to retrace my steps). I had planned to walk to Changuimun Gate but the paths towards the Malbawi information centre and the Sukjeongmun Gate were completely covered in ice, which I couldn't manage in the shoes that I was wearing. I ended up taking the road down a bit, followed by a walk in the Samcheong Park, which was also very nice, although I couldn't tell if there was an alternative way up to the next gate. I was ready to have lunch so I descended to Bukchon village but I will definitely continue my walk the next time I visit Seoul. Apart from the icy conditions, the paths are often paved, well-maintained and covered in mats in places to make them less slippy (which doesn't stop the ice in the shade though). The trail is also well signposted, even in places where you can only see traces of the wall. You need to be reasonably fit to do this because there are a few steep sections but it's also easy to do the path in sections."
12,5.0,"There is a pathway that can be followed around the entire wall. Get a map before you start as it has access points and approx walking times. Takes 12 hours to do in one hit but easy to do in sections over several days. The section up to Seoul Tower is very popular and can get busy. The top section over the mountains has opening times (winter 10-3, summer 9-4, closed Mondays)."
13,5.0,"Best thing I did in Seoul! You can do the whole loop in one day, or you can do it in portions. Make sure you get the map from a tourist office in advance to help you plan. The parts over the Baegaksan 343m, Inwangsan 340m, Namsan 271m and Naksan 124m are step. This is a HIKE, not a stroll in a park. It can be hard to find your way, especially in the urban areas where the wall is missing. Fortunately, there are small plates or circular signs on the pavement, on the walls of buildings or attached to lampposts that says Hanyangdoseong or Fortress Trail. It can also be useful to look carefully at the dotted path on the map, since detours are sometimes indicated there.I got my badge at the Sungnyemun gate guard post. Both it and the Malbawi Information Center are closed on Mondays. I only stamped my map at the two other stops, and I'm not sure if it is possible to get a badge there.I did it in two days. I first did Sungnyemun to Hyehwamun one day, and then the rest the other day. I then got my badge at Sungnyemun. Both of these points are easy to get to by suway.There were lots of people doing the hike, but almost only locals."
14,5.0,"First of all, let me tell you that I love walking, for real. So when I found out about Seoul city wall, i was so excited. Although I did not take the full route of walk, only partly from the Namsan park, but I was so happy. From the distance, you can see the view of Seoul. But, take a note, I would not recommend this for older traveler or ones who travel with kids."
15,5.0,"The trail is amazing to walk on - it is quiet and really beautiful. You get great views of Seoul . I started from Heunginjimun Gate and walked until Hyehwamun Gate. Right now, in July 2016, the Seoul Wall Museum is closed!!! Although many sites suggest you start from there, right now you can't."
16,5.0,"I did the Baegak Mountain Trail which was one of the more challenging parts of the City Wall hike. As this part is heavily guarded by the military, u will need your passport to be issued a tag. Do not take photographs of any security cameras of picture facing the direction of the city as they are ""military secrets""! The hike and and views were awesome. Start at Changuimun gate and exit Waryong Park for a hike of abt 3.5-4km. Bring loads of water to hydrate in this summer heat!"
17,5.0,"Did only the part along the Namsan park and the little one around dongdaemun, would like to return some day and try to follow the recommended routes on the Korean tourism website! It's of a much better scale than the one in suwon so do prepare for 1-2 days!"
18,5.0,I didn't know about the city wall until I was walking up to Namsan Park and it was just there in front of me! It is a great structure and when you get to the top of the park you can see the wall all the way down into Seoul.  The wall can be seen from the top of the park and the Seoul Namsan Tower so no need to  make a special visit.  Just go about your daily tourist trips and you will no doubt see it along the way.
19,4.0,"The city wall is not very well organized in some sections.  Missing all together in others.  Easy to get lost in...  But some sections are well done and rebuild, especially when combined with local parks.  Anyways, it is very challenging to do the entire wall in a day.  To get started, the Namsan (south) section is medium difficult but well developed.  The Naksan section is shorter on the east side.  But for a challenge, do the North and North West sections that climbs through two large peaks, 340 m high each.  Be ware that the north section is a fully active military zone and you need to have your passport to get it.  It is not very pleasant to be watched by solders throughout your hike."
