0,4.0,"Endless rows of shopping for everyone including shoes, clothes, accessories, spectacles, household stuff, food, anything! I made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday and ended up having to jostle elbow to elbow with people with or without trolleys. Beware of wheels! This is directly connected to Shinsegae Department Store, Shinsegae Duty Free, and JW Marriott hotel so its quite the weather proof activity which can be a god-send when you are caught unprepared. Mostly for ladies though, didnt see alot of men's stuff around."
1,4.0,I did some souvenir and gift shopping last weekend when the rain was pouring down and i didnâ€™t wanna stay in my flat all day. I took the Metro No. 9 express line (fantastic!) from VHS station and arrived at Express Bus Terminal very quickly. I wandered around underground and found everything i needed at reasonable prices. Its not the best in town but all in all it checked all the boxes.
2,4.0,"This place has changed a lot since I was there at least 3-4 years ago. It's brighter but more confusing. First, the there may be exits to the subway which you need to exit twice. That's mainly because express bus terminal stations is an interchange (bus and subways) with many lines. The upgrades and restructure of the underground space caused all this weird exits and the signs did not always direct you completely. Eg. I was looking out for exit 3 and along the way, that signage was lost... I had to base on my intuition and memory to navigate out.. worrying if I may end up entering the station twice and paid again. Once you get out of the confusing subway exits, you should walk within the underground shopping street. The place is crowded with people but well organized. You could also consider shopping in the mall area (where Shinsegae is). There are shops there that offer direct tax free discount with freebies if you bring along your passport and your flight (out of Seoul/Korea) itinerary for their input into the system and verification. This saves you time in the airport, hunting and waiting for those tax-refund machines."

There's so many things to see, clothing, shoes and etc just like what you can get and see at myeongdong but of course the prices are much cheaper here. One might get lost in finding this underground though is stated as express bus underground shopping. Just ask around and many kind people will guide you. As I, too lost my way and found it while just walking around the underground. You will love the place"
4,5.0,"You can spend hours under here shopping for cheap clothes, decor items and even some furniture. I'd highly recommend coming here but come during the afternoon, not when it opens at 10am because that's when most of the stores start to open up, not when they are all open up by."
5,5.0,"This is the place to shop for fashionable but inexpensive clothes. As soon as you step out off the train station, you will be overwhelmed by all the stalls that display fashionable Korean clothes. You can spend an entire day here shopping. If you have the money."
6,5.0,"So much here. Plenty of restaurants, shopping, access to buses and the subway. Great central meeting point in Seoul"
7,4.0,"I find the shopping experience here much more pleasant than in Dongdaemun. It is indoors, so it is ideal when it gets too hot or too cold outside. Price-wise, it seems to be cheaper than other place, with mixture of local-made and imported ones from neighbouring country. At start, it was abit hard to find my way as the area is large.. I managed to get some food at the end after getting tired from shopping. Hence for shopping experience, it is 4/5 in my opinion~"
8,4.0,"this place is sooooo.. awesome! looking for a place to shop? Well I definitely recommend this place if you love shopping! but you need the whole day or even more...there's a lot of good offers from clothing and korean make up...this is literally shop till you drop..its left and right! So, you better eat first but then there are  restaurants as well that you can stop by to have some quick snacks or coffee...but it's a bit far from the airport..took like more than an hour if you take the metro...aside from that....!!! it's all worth it! will definitely come back here again!"
