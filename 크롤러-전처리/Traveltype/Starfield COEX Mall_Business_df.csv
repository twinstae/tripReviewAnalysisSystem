0,4.0,"Then this is the place to go.Loads of nice shops, plenty of places to eat and drink plus all kinds of attractions including a library and an aquarium!"
1,4.0,"This huge convention centre can host several conferences in parallel. It is so large, that one can easily get lost (also due to limited availability of indications inside)."
2,4.0,"Large mall with lots of food types. Connected to samseong coex station & can be easily covered. Lots of shopping, spacious & Asian, Thai, Korean foods are available."
3,3.0,"Covering the underground of a huge block (under COEX, hotels, office buildings), there is a large number of mainstream shops, several food/restaurant courts, a two-storey library - except for the restaurants and the shoppers you donâ€™t get a specific Korea feeling here. Prices appear also to be slightly higher than in traditional shopping areas."
4,5.0,"Starfield COEX is a vibrant underground mall which offers visitors an amazing diversity of experiences. There is a beautiful library which radiates an aura of serenity in the busy mall. Authentic cusine from Turkey, India, Thailand and range of Korean food and fusion food. The mall is linked to the exhibition halls which can be accessed easily on account of the excellent signage. Prices are reasonable and the mall offers very good value for money. A must see, must experience mall. Five stars from me for ambience and feel good factor. Amazing Korea."
5,2.0,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by. The duty free Lotte mall attached to it demands not only your passport but the return e tickets before letting you buy anything.. so if you want something from there keep the required documents with you.
6,5.0,This mall has it all:- Affordable brands on clothing.- Duty-Free on cosmetics.- Lots of choices for food.- Entertainment for all ages.- Subway stations just below.- Several hotels.
7,5.0,"A giant mall in the Gangnam district with something for everyone.Ranging from local products to high end products, a cinema and an aquarium.Coffee shops everywhere and a huge variety of places to eat.Information desks spread everywhere with helpful staff that speak many languages."
8,5.0,"It's a really huge mall. It's so easy to get lost inside it. But everything you need is here. From Korean and international clothes and cosmetics to food and services. This mall is in the same building as the exhibition halls so it's really convenient if you have an event to attend since you can just walk around while waiting. It's also connected to the City Airport  so after checking in your baggage and going through immigration, you can go around the mall while waiting for the bus that takes you to either Incheon or Gimpo airport."
9,4.0,I was attending a conference in COEX convention center. So this is the mall as well. So big that you may get lost. Little costly but there are lots of items. Many food outlets to choose from in case you are hungry. Food is not so costly.
10,3.0,"This is a big serpentine mall, lots of stores, nothing really special, bring crumbs to find your ay out!"
11,5.0,So close to aloft hotel  easy to get there as most cab know it.  Nice shopping place and lots of food there and everything in one stop
12,3.0,"I arrived a little after 10 on Sunday and felt like it was a ghost town. The mall is enormous but there were just a few people about. The stores seemed to be closed or without any customers. When I came later, around noon, it was hard to get around as the mall got very crowded. And it was apparent why. Queues were forming in front of all restaurants which aren't in a dedicated food court but scattered all around. Apart from many restaurants and a few stores, the mall is home to several halls where 3 different conventions were being held on the day. In addition, on the second floor you can find hundreds of small businesses."
13,4.0,"The mall is huge and I enjoyed walking in the mall. However, it was difficult for me to find directions. I felt that it was like a maze.There are a lot of restaurants in the mall and I particularly liked the donkatsu restaurant Saboten a lot. Because the mall is connected to Grand Intercontinental hotel and Hyundai department store, it was convenient to wonder around in all three places without having to go outside."
14,4.0,This is the largest conference venue I've ever attended. You need flat shoes and be prepared for miles of walking inside!
15,4.0,It is not usual to see people carrying maps when walking in malls. But the sheer size of this mall and you will understand why.The walk spaces are wide but the stores themselves are pretty moderate in size.Both the Grand Continental and Continental Coex are found at both opposites of the mall. There is a casino and Lotte Duty free. Check out the Megabox Cinema. Extremely classy.
16,4.0,Huge mall! It's very easy to get lost so definitely grab a map. It's a pretty standard mall with some fun stores. Check out Butter for kitschy household items and souvenirs. The Hyundai department store is a must see. It's 11 stories and filled with high priced boutique stores. It's fun just for the experience. The mall has a ton of restaurants in and around the food court. They are all fairly quick so you could easily eat here on break from a conference.
17,5.0,"Coex Mall has so many shops one needs an entire day to cover the entire shopping place still i would say you bet you'll come here to shop. All air-conditioned the shops range from Clothing, Souvenirs, toys, artificial flowers, jewelry, toys and eateries."
18,4.0,"The mall is massive. Very close to park hyatt hotel and attached to the station. It has an aquarium, movie theater and a food court. Many brand shops but very expensive in-comparison to other places. Good place to enjoy and rest after a long business meeting."
19,4.0,"I spent a week working in the Trade Tower in Seoul. I happened to stay in the COEX Intercontinental, and I was shown 'the way' to walk from one to the other through the COEX Mall. The first day I was overwhelmed with the commercialism, but then as the week wore on, the COEX mall became a friend providing warmth, sustinence and entertainment for me as a solo business traveler in a strange land.HOLLYS COFFEE: Can't find it on the map, but it's worth a visit. I have never before had a Dutch Baby at a restaurant (they're a family favorite to make at a shindig) and it was good (not great). The coffee was very good, better to my palate than Star*ucks).I also ate at Kervan one night, sushi for lunch, found some skin products at one store, and found groceries to stash in my hotel room at the Hyundai basement store.The entertainment was watching the very young, very hip K-POP population meandering the mall in massive crowds at all times of day and night.The surrounding area is not bad to walk, and had some nice sculptures. Quite urban, noisy, not really pedestrian-fun, but not unfriendly to walkers either."
20,3.0,"When I was in Seoul last year, January, COEX Mall was closed for renovation. Since I was here again, but this time on business, it was convenient for me to visit as I was staying at Park Hyatt, plus there isn't much choice staying around this part of Seoul. And I don't have time not energy to visit the more diverse shopping areas after work.There are many retail shops; restaurants and cafes are plentiful too, but they don't come cheap, so be prepared to spend.I was here during early spring when it can still be quite freezing at times, so shopping underground, staying indoor worked well for me. But I know some people absolutely hate it coz it can be pretty claustrophobic.Don't need to make a deliberate trip here, but if you are around the neighborhood, why not just swing by."
21,3.0,I'm never sure how to review something like this. It is a mall. There are a lot of shops selling a lot of things you can buy in a lot of other places. I don't know why I'd buy these things in this location. The best feature of the mall are the bevy of restaurants that it has.
22,2.0,"Went in 3 times at around 8pm in evening and all 3 times found the mall to be in a closed type of condition - No people, most shops closed and hardly anything to see."
23,4.0,"For the past two years the COEX Mall has been either closed or partly opened. It's handy for those on business who don't have time to visit some of the more diverse shopping areas. There's about 3/4 souvenir shops plus a range of other specialty shops. While many of the shops were the same as in its previous layout, a few new outlets are there and there's a good range of restaurants/cafes. The drawbacks are it's not cheap and some of the owners/staff are somewhat rude - forget the sports shoe shop! If they want to be rude to foreigners make sure they can't speak Korean. But overall a great mall that I'm sure will gather momental as the official opening occurs in early December."
24,4.0,"Coex mall is attached to the convention center and to the subway.  It's huge, has great food options, an aquarium and a movie theatre. However, there is still some construction going on and the place is really a maze.  Also very crowded around lunch."
25,3.0,"maybe you can find something good with good prices our good discount, but I think it better to visit here on special events time.I have been there in March and August and I think second time was better."
26,3.0,"I thought this place was pretty big, unlike some reviewers.i worried about going too far and getting lost. Lots of places to eat, lots of variety in the shopping, and nicely interconnected with the surrounding buildings, sure, renovations were happening, but its still enormous. It was really busy on Saturday! I liked it."
27,4.0,"I was at the COEX for a conference and only on my last day did I discover the large sprawling complex underneath the entire region. Lot of good average stores, some brand name fashion and some unique breaking in fashion, along with souvenir stores and a good selection of restaurants, some associated with the Intercontinental hotels above."
28,4.0,"Well, it's a mall, so it's not earth-shattering. It ha a massive selection of stores sprawled across the area, mostly underground with very little natural light. The layout can be a little confusing at first but the interactive maps are great."
29,4.0,"Fun place! Watch a Korean movie, people watch, eat well! Wide assortment of clothes/bags/shoes but electronics could be better. Easy to get lost. Helpful touch maps at strategic points to get oriented. Wish there were more benches to lounge about."
