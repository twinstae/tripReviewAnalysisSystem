0,2.0,Was recommended by a local. However I am disappointed towards Youll. Predictable storyline. Over price for the experience.
1,4.0,"Great Quaint Theater a Tucked away near Palace walls. We showed up to a surprise free concert in the courtyard. Blues, rock and Jazz with an open coffee shop and bar on two levels to the side and lots of open seating. Very pleasant for a date or with family. The performance in the theatre was a blend of Korean traditional music and dance, martial arts and ballet! Very beautiful and interesting!!!"
2,5.0,"This is a theatrical experience lasting around 1.5 hours, there is a narrator singing at points in Korean, however, there is a screen offering English subtitles through the performance.All the actors are in traditional Korean dress offering a cultural blast of dance and colour..With an amazing traditional drum performance at the endWell worth a visit"
3,5.0,"If you are interested in traditional Korean music and dance, this performance is for you. This musical performance is for everyone including those who don't speak Korean. Although it is entertaining for adults, my 3 years old seems bored and luckily didn't make any noise throughout the performance. So, I wouldn't suggest people who have small kids to watch this. Definitely worth the money compare to Nanta or other shows."
