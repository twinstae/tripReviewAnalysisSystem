0,5.0,"Walking back from the Gyeongbukgong Palace towards the Cheonggyecheon stream, we chanced upon this two statues in the middle of the busy street. When we went near, it led us to the discovery of an underground museum. A gem for anyone who wants to learn the history of King Sejon, families and kids joined the activities. I found the second part of the museum on Admiral Yi SunShin fascinating as actual artifacts are displayed together with his story of bravery and innovation in ancient war fare - all in both Korean and English. There is even a 3D theatre with fixed times for an about 12 min show."
