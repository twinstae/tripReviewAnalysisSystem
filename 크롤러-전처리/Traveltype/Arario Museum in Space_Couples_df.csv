0,5.0,"I loved the way the art pieces were arranged around the building (even in the toilets). It was definitely one of the most interesting repurposed building, considering the layout was a little strange in the first place with cramped stairs and low-ceilings in places.Much of the feel of the art was also very raw, just like the space. There were definitely interesting pieces, I especially liked the ones by the Filipino artists, which talked about social and environmental issues (Geraldine Javier’s installation was complex and beautiful). A lot of the ones about human interaction (Tracey Emin’s quilt was also a very striking piece) had great narratives and interesting approaches (like that video on the topmost floor)."
1,5.0,Go and check it out. Great art in a unique setting. They made good use of the existing building and you get a good mix of modern art pieces. Can't understand the people not into modern art giving a bad rating. Don't go there if you don't like it in the first place. I don't like seafood. Just because I'm on vacation I don't visit a seafood place one recommends. Simple as that. Don't miss out on Fritz coffee next door.
2,3.0,Ok I just did not get any of the pieces. I know it is modern art but none of the installations made any sense to us. The museum is pretty small and we thought that the fee (~$20 for two) was a bit too steep for what’s inside. I did like the building design though and they also have some tables outside where you can relax or enjoy a cup of coffee. I also liked that the museum was not full - there were maybe two or three other visitors making it a nice break from tourist groups.
3,5.0,"We loved Arario Museum in Space. We only had time for one art museum in Seoul and we're so glad we chose this! Truly unique experience, we loved every minute of it. The combination of the building and the art is captivating."
4,5.0,"The building itself is a work of art. Covered in shrubs and greenery, with footpaths and connections between exhibits it makes navigating an experience. What was most striking is how intimate the experience is. This isn't a crowded museum so you are able to interact or appreciate exhibits at your leisure, for now at least. Pieces are interesting and feature names such as Marc Quinn and Keith Haring. They are also thought provoking and deal with a number of adult themes that pull and prod at your comfort levels and this is somehow amplified in the intimate space, lighting and design of the building. In some ways it feels as if you're in a strange labyrinth. It goes without saying that this is not always suitable for children. Only con was that the museum is a little pricey."
