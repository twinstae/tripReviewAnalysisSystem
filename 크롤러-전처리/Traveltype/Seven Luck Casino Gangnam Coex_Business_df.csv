0,5.0,Big Big casino with all level and types of gambling verities ....Its a neat and clean place with a good mix of people from all over the world...its attached to a hotel and you can stay there if you want
1,2.0,"I was staying in the Continental Hotel, which is linked with this casino, so it was easy to pass by. I only stayed for 15 mins though as there was no attraction to the gambling tables. I would have liked to poker, but only two tables were open and I didn't really feel welcome. Also the other tables were not really international so I decided to spend my money somewhere else..."
2,4.0,"Personnel were not exactly friendly but polite enough. The casino is small on the inside with only about 5 tables open (in late afternoon when I went) for blackjack. (an equal or greater # for baccarat). Only two tables were  at the 10K won -- roughly $10 minimum -- bet which is my speed (others at 50K won or higher). I waited at least 15 minute to get a seat. 6-deck shoe but the rules were the best I've ever experienced: dealer stands on 17, double-down on any initial hand, and ... surrender on an initial hand. I would definitely go back again."
3,1.0,The  staff cant even manage a fake smile to a guest. Very monotonous  tone (even if you excuse their English skills). Dealers are just robots with bones and muscles. Interior was just average and there were not enough tables for people to play. I am sure they can see there are people waiting to play while they are just looking at other people playing at a table.
4,1.0,"In addition to previous comments about being dark and fun-less we've experinsed the real fraud.They use spesial dealing machines for Black Jack - you don't see card deck there like in LV. Instead they are all inside the machine and are shaffled there too, and the machine shaffles them in favor of casino.We've spent 2 hrs there, and calculated that 5 players together had less BJs than the dealer alone. Also there were VERY few busts for dealer, and every 2nd time he had 18-20 right away.All 5 of us knew how to play BJ properly, but none were able to get above our initial amount. Never seen anything like this. Stay away."
