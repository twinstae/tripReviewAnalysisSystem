0,1.0,I went at 12 F and looked for cosmetic product. The staff there dont even know english. And when i asked this one counter. Cannot remember what the shop name. But its near escalator. Maybe pop up store. She was playing with her phone. Then i asked few times and she refused to answer my questions. Keep on playing with her phone. Then after few times then she answered its a toner without looking at my face. And keep playing the phone. Really disappointed with what happen.
1,5.0,"We""ve spend 1.5 hours there. A bit expensive, but very posh.Nice clean and a lot of brands there. Not many people. Parking in front with parking service."
2,4.0,"Of course the store sells all the items expected of any and all high-end retailers which one can find almost anywhere in the world -- but the basement food hall and grocery store is worth the trip. Yes, you can purchase ""street foods"" and sit in the dining hall to consumer, or peruse the limitless items in the grocery to take home to cook yourself. Either way, foodies will love this place -- though we have found prices of identical grocery items to be a bit less expensive at the Shinsegae Department Store a few blocks away."
3,4.0,"This massive multi-floor department store stood across the street from my Seoul hotel, so I went over to check it out one day. It seemed to be a typical upscale store, similar to myriad others in the world, with many boutique shops and most prices on the high end. I noted many Korean-made items available. All floors looked well maintained and had nicely displayed merchandise. It was early November and the whole place was already beautifully decorated for the upcoming holiday season. I didn't interact with any employees so cannot comment on the staff and service. The food court in the basement, however, brought me back to Lotte twice. I ate two very good dinners (Chinese and Korean) there and found the staff upbeat and pleasant. The cashier for the food court and at least one person at each order counter spoke good English. The area became crowded in the early evening, and I shared my table with a local resident on each visit. Both became lovely dinner companions as we discussed many topics, including what not to miss during my exploration of Seoul. For those looking for good buys, I cannot recommend Lotte, based on what I saw. But there are plenty of other places nearby, such as Namdaemun Market with its estimated 10,172 stores. It offers bargains at many shops and provides a totally different experience from typical department stores"
4,2.0,I am not how to start. I needed some travelling supplies while on vacation and went to one of the boutiques in the store to buy some. When the clerk realized I only wanted travel size products her English skills suddenly evaporated. I made my way to the luggage department hoping to find something there. They didn’t but the staff led me to the department I could find it in. My thinking is the staff in the high end shop should be trained by the people who trained those in luggage.  I have shopped in other “high end” stores and my expectations are that the greater the value of the goods the more valuable the service is. I don’t expect attitude only good service. This experience has coloured my opinion of Lottie’s as a “high end “ store.  My rating is based on Lottie’s being a high end store.
5,5.0,"Many things to buy. Lots of brand. Nearby Lotte Mart like a supermaeket for buying some food, snack and beverage. Also, price is cheaper than other supermarket."
6,4.0,"A large department store along the lines of its Japanese counterparts with lots of eager Chinese tourists in the luxury goods ( particularly cosmetics dept- well actually in much smaller numbers already due to recent strained ties between the two countries). Lots of brand name goods, but if you are looking for more diverse fares there are lots of other options in Seoul"
7,3.0,"Just a feedback on the Food halls at Lotte Department Store at the basement. If you are looking to buy tidbits, snacks, seaweed, etc. To bring home, the choices here are rather limited and do compare prices if you are buying a lot. We bought our items here but was disappointed to find prices for the same snack elsewhere in independent marts cheaper by 10,000 won and others by a few thousand won. Sharing so you won't have the same experience. Check out before buying. Of course they may still have items cheaper just that we didn't buy those perhaps."
8,5.0,"Without fail, we always make it a point to visit Lotte Department stores in every visit. Whether in Seoul or other cities ( if available). The Lotte ambience is cosy, a great place to shop here.In particular we love their nice & huge supermarket; with its interesting, wide, excellent & beautiful range of products. And the food section here is great especially the bakeries, & eateries too.Prices at Lotte are more affordable compared to the very upmarket Shinsegae or even Hyundai Department stores. We always buy alot nice of stuff from the supermarket here.This store is within walking distance of Myeongdong shopping street where we stay. There is another branch just outside  Seoul Main Station."
9,3.0,Just another mall in seoul. locatated in the central and close to local shopping area. free wifi is the best park. many branded products at cheap price. so worth a visit if you are in that area.
10,4.0,There are many attractive shops here. I go to duty free shops whenever I come to Seoul. I saw some event in front of the store. It's so fun.
11,4.0,"Nice place, conveniently located for us near our Lotte Hotel  Has just about something for everyone, including foodstuffs, and is a pleasure to shop at."
12,5.0,Similar to the Shinsegae. This store is pretty big with a lot of shopping options. Pretty good location too
13,3.0,"Nothing much, just a department store and a supermarket within a big lotte complex. Had a good Korean meal on the top floor. Born-ga by some famous chef from Korea. Big building are seldom in Hanoi. This is way off the tourist area."
14,4.0,"This is a big department store the way Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Harrod's in London, El Corte Ingles in Madrid, La Rinascente in Milan are. It has a lot of high street and high end luxury brands. Cosmetics on the first floor to draw customers in and clothes on the upper floors. One could spend hours in it..."
15,3.0,"We only explored the lotte mart. If you want to buy korean supermarket things, this is the place. The market is crowded so it feels the market is small. You can also buy kimchi packs here."
16,5.0,This is a very nice shopping mall. It is huge and the selection here is outstanding.The food court is amazing as well.
17,5.0,"The Lotte department store comprises of three different buildings with 4 slightly different styles.  AvenueL, Lotte department store, Duty Free, and Young Plaza.  We found Young Plaza to be the best for us.  As, we consider ourselves younger.  It is also a bit more affordable.  Great service throughout the department store.  It is quite large and lots of shopping to be done."
18,5.0,"The Lotte Department Store is a classic, great department store, the kind that is now difficult to find in the US. It is many floors of high-quality merchandise. If you miss the great department stores which were once so common in the US but are now scarce, you will be in heaven here. Prices are fairly steep, but they were having good sales when I was there. They have a small army of staff - everywhere you look there is a smiling sales clerk waiting to assist. I must say, they put the American department store to shame."
19,4.0,"This huge shopping model is located in one of the shopping areas in Seoul, the Myongdong district.It has a wide selection of stores, however it can be get quite crowded (at least in the weekends) hence if you need to use a fitting room you might have to expect to queue for a while.Best option: get there early to do your shopping."
20,5.0,"This is one of the most famous (or at least most advertised) department stores in Seoul, and hence, from the time it opens till the time it's closed, there are huge crowds all over the place. It is still possible to navigate through, but be prepared for a very busy area. Use the escalators, as the lifts are packed! There are 11 floors with top 3 of them dedicated to Duty Free shopping. That's where the ""madhouse"" begins :) - in a good way!You will be able to find any kind of cosmetics there, and the prices are good. Don't forget to bargain and ask for freebies!!! I know, it is a large department store, but you still allowed to ask for discount, gifts, and freebies - and get them!All assistants are helpful and speak ok-ish English. Have your passport (or the photo of it) and your return flight details, and have your VAT removed from your total. If you pay by Visa you can get 5-15% of the total bill. Negotiate it - with gold visa you can get 10%, with platinum -15%. In the main store you could find great fashion - local and international. The interns one isn't a bargain, but go for the local designers and objects - you will be pleasantly surprised both by look and by price. There are restaurants and cafes all over the place, so if you need to rest your feet and boost your energy - there are plenty of opportunities to do so!"
21,5.0,It is so convenient to buy all those famous brand over there and all the items are tax- free already. You can't leave until your pocket become empty!
22,3.0,"We last visited here around two years ago and this is still a typical mega mall with branded apparel, bags, cosmetics and a duty free on the upper floor.  Do note that some items in the duty free are much higher than what you can get for them in other stores like Shisegae, so shop around. We loved the food court and supermarket in the basement though, and it had almost everything imaginable from vegetables to cakes and sauces and fruits,  We bought a couple of punnets of strawberries for 8000  won each and they were sweet and ripe."
23,4.0,"This review is only about the food court level at Lotte Main.  It's an excellent place for eating and shopping for food items to take out, with the exception of wine and liquor (very limited selection, especially of liquor).  There are several casual restaurant style places where you can order mainly noodle/rice bowls and sit down at a table to eat.  And of course there are dozens of counters selling everything from sushi to pastries.  There's also a more traditional grocery store area with produce, meat/poultry/fish and other items.  If you go during the day it is quieter and easier to navigate, but one advantage of going within an hour or so of closing is that many of the more perishable items such as fresh-baked goods and prepared meal items with meat or fish are marked down for quick sale.  We were able to get dinner for two for about 10,000 won (less than $10) and a bag full of excellent pastries all marked down by 20%.  It's very crowded and bustling at that time but you can get some great bargains if you're willing to fight through the crowds."
24,3.0,"While the Lotte Department store is huge, it’s still just a mall with overpriced goods. If you like shopping with a tremendous crowd and pushy customers then be my guest and shop at Lotte Main Department store. There were some sale items but most stores appeared to have relatively few discounts and even the specials and promotions they had going on were worthless or useless. Try going to the outlets where there are still hordes of people but at least there are some pretty cool deals if you look hard enough or are a comparative shopper. Avoid this department store if possible."
25,4.0,"Lots of expensive brands names here and some duty free shopping.The B1 food hall and supermarket was the standout, has one of the best sushi trains I have eaten at in a long time."
26,5.0,I would recommend start the visit at main building from Bottom food court and super market for best experience.
27,5.0,"Despite being pre-warned by my friend to either go early or before closing time, I was totally shocked with the people flow in the duty free section of the department store located at 10-11 floor.  This is particularly true to the cosmetic and/or skin care section,  Here, they needed to register your passports or foreign ID for tax free price.  You can take the purchased items right away under Korean brands, otherwise, you need to pick up the goods at the airport for foreign brands.  This duty free section will be opened for business 1 hour earlier than regular business hour - there is a special entrance at the back (near car park) to go up."
28,4.0,"In the heart of the Myeongdong district, shoppers will find the Lotte Department Store. This is the flagship for the Korean based chain and it is huge, providing many hours worth of retail shopping opportunities for those who haven't had enough from shopping the streets of Myeongdong. Lotte reminds me of the SOGO (Japanese) Department store that we have in Hong Kong. There is a bit of everything that department store shoppers might need; jewellery, clothing, handbags, shoes, accessories, make-up, electronics and a wide range of other goods. There is also a good lower level food court and supermarket at Lotte Department Store. The supermarket is enjoyable to browse even as a tourist. It is nice seeing the quality of foods available here. Overall, not sure if this is the best department store available in Seoul but you can certainly do a lot worse.  Lotte Department Store is directly accessible from the Euljiro Station for those interested."
29,4.0,Just following my wife around the mall for hours.  Lots of nice wares.  Lots of good restaurants and excellent food court.  But a mall is a mall for me.  I did get fed and watered so - all in all - no complaints.
30,3.0,"Next door to Lotte hotel which I stayed for 4 nights.Pros: big, clean, nice mallAttentive sales people Big cosmetic areaCons:Very rude Chinese lady at the currency exchange. No hi, thank you, how can I help you? She acted like she was doing me a favor and didn't like her job. I thought she was unpleasant to just me but she was also rude to a Chinese couple behind me. She really needs to quit or get fired. Needs better ventilation in the food court. My husband felt sick with all the smells in the tight, poor air area.Food court needs to provide sandwiches or other alternatives besides Korean food. This food area/store doesn't even come close to Thailand which accommodates to some Westerners.Besides that, it would've been a pleasant mall."
31,5.0,"My first visit to lotte mall is at the olympic park area including lotte theme park, and the second one is lotte mall at Myongdong Area. The Mall is huge really huge with a lot of visitor. They area in the main location of Myongdong shopping area, including lotte hotel and korea star walk at the lower lever near hotel lobby. The mall is completely with many shop and restaurant, since we eat at myongdong area so we don't eat inside the mall. But I think you must try. Interesting."
32,4.0,"All major cosmetic, luxury goods and electronics are sold here at the Duty Free Mall. You can even shop online and have the goods delivery to airport for pick up, skipping the hassle of queuing! On the basement lvl is the grocery mart and food court. Worth your time to explore and try the food, kimchi and desserts. You will not regret this!"
33,5.0,"I will put it very simple. Go to the duty free floors, bring your passport and flight details and start to shop masks and cosmetic at excellent a prices. You will find any brand with unbeatable offers and sales. Be careful with the Chinese crowds cause they buy buy and buy more than anyone else :)"
34,3.0,This place offers a great variety of luxury goods. All clothing brands can be found here. They have a great food court and you can spend a whole day shopping here.
35,5.0,So much fun going through the department store. Spend a lot of time in the food hall trying all different kinds of foods. My favourite was the mochi filled with different flavoured ice cream fillings. Didn't really browse the clothing departments but spent a but of time upstairs in the home wares and event hall. Left with a few good buys and a satisfied tummy!
36,4.0,"Lotte department store has many brands for men, women, kids, sports, casual, house needs, cosmetics, and many others, it took over 2 hours of walking just to explore the place and do very little shopping, it is very busy and crowded. Once you are there I would recommend that you take a nice break for coffee or tea in the middle of your shopping time."
37,1.0,"i bought a pair of ray ban sunglasses from the lotte department store in myeongdong. i assumed it was in perfect condition since it was a brand new pair and was KRW 240000 (and you'd assume for it to be of a certain quality). i started using it only a few days after it was purchased. that was when i noticed a manufacturing defect on the frame. there was a bubble under the frame coating which can only be attributed to a fault in the manufacturing process.i brought it back for an exchange but it was stoically refused because any returns have to be done within a 2 hour time frame, even for products with manufacturing defects. needless to say i was pissed out of my mind and will never be purchasing anything from lotte department store again.when i enquired about the warranty, they said i had to take it to the local dealership myself. no further information was given except it would take 20 days for the local dealership to decide on whether any rectification will be made. by which time i would've long left korea.there is no customer service centre at lotte department store and when you have an after purchase problem with what you bought, all the previously eager beaver sales persons will shun you like the plague.apart from the 2 hour storewide return policy, the salesperson also examined then pointed out very tiny, superficial marks on the frame (which i'd made accidentally) to further justify the need to adhere to the 2 hour return policy. seriously?! how would it matter unless the lotte staff were going to take the defective pair and resell it to the next unsuspecting tourist.all the time during our conversation, she frequently asked for the sunglasses after which she'd try to scratch out the defect with her fingernails although i repeatedly asked her to stop it. she even tried to make off with it to somewhere else in the building to file the uneven frame coating down. like it's even possible and won't further damage the frame?!almost everywhere in lotte, you will have the same lousy customer service. before you congratulate yourself on the marginal savings (if any) you've made by purchasing it there, think of all the unpleasantness you'll have to deal with if you find out a few days later that the product is defective. while tourist dollars are welcomed, all else (e.g. feedback, exchanges and returns) are not, even where the product was originally defective.most purchases over KRW 30,000 are eligible for a tax refund but for all the saccharine sweetness of lotte salespersons (e.g. accompanying you to the cashier for their commission), not a single one will offer to print the tax refund form out for you even though you're obviously a tourist unless you specifically request for it with much difficulty in english. (the tax refund form has to be provided by the store in which you've made your purchases.)try it if you don't believe me! for all it's worth, i'll rather pay a few dollars more and get it anywhere but in lotte! 1st world department store run by scam artists.p.s.: my sunglasses are a lot worse for wear after the sales person's scrubbing and recounting my experience makes my blood boil."
38,4.0,.....but I had to be impressed with this shopping centre. Something like 10 floors of everything from designer label to basement bargain sellout tables. From duty free to great food. Even has a fresh food market in the basement that has some of the most delicious delicacies around. Still hate shopping but enjoyed the experience
39,3.0,"This departmental store is located in the same complex as Lotte Hotel, and has everything that you would expect of a mega store, from branded clothes to electronics, and also includes the Lotte duty free shop as well.  There are multiple restaurant options on the higher floors. But we prefer the Premium foodcourt that is located in the basement, which is clean, brightly lit and has choices ranging from Japanese food to bulgogi etc.  There is also a well stocked supermarket, where the fruits especially are very fresh. You should also check out the small bakery near the foodcourt that sells very delicious fried mungbean fritters filled with red bean."
40,4.0,"Lotte Departmental Store at Myeongdong is a must visit for any shoppers to Seoul. It sells everything and caters to foreign visitors with large selection of duty-free merchandises. Not surprisingly, the store is filled with tourist shoppers. Interestingly, if you purchase any duty-free goods at Lotte Departmental Store, the goods can only be collected at Incheon International Airport when you leave South Korea. If you are looking to buy something, Lotte Departmental Store Myeongdong is your best bet."
41,5.0,"Go to the Duty Free Store if you are a foreigner. Prices are much cheaper there. You do not need to worry if you are buying international brands since the collection area is at the airport. However, if you are buying Korean brand stuffs, you can carry your items on the spot. There are 11 or 12 levels altogether. Enjoy your shopping there."
42,4.0,"I don't usually rate department stores because I'm not a big shopper. I did enjoy walking around this one though and having a meal on the bottom floor. Like other reviews mentioned, it's a lot of the same brands you'd find in a large western mall. Nice to look at, but not so nice to buy... well at least not on my budget.I do agree that the food court was nice. It's a little more expensive than some other meals, but really not that expensive for the quality. It's not all Korea food, but rather just various Asian cuisines. I sat down and had some soba noodles which reminded me of my previous stays in Japan.The 1st floor is mostly named brand makeup that doesn't have much to do with Korea and the following floors up until the 8th floor follow suit with other brand name products. Things change once you hit the 9th floor though. That floor is special in that it's duty free shopping. I guess it's the same kind of discount you'd get at the airport duty free, but I didn't check. You'll need a passport, flight ticket or at least to know your flight number to make a purchase.The duty free area of this shopping mall has turned into a must for Chinese tourists. Mostly because it's part of just about, if not every, Chinese guided tour group. During peak hours it'll be crammed pack and basically shoulder to shoulder. Given the target audience most of the employees on this floor can also speak Chinese fluently, but their English might be just a few phrases.It's right across the street from the Myeongdong outside shopping area, so it's a place you can stroll through quickly without going out of the way. Then you can cross it off your list, maybe pick up a few small duty free items and have a quick bite to eat in the food court."
43,5.0,"I have noticed that the food court at Lotte department store in Myeongdong has had a few mentions here.  Well, you do have to experience it to know why.  Almost the entire basement of this high class department store has been dedicated to food.  There is a grocery section, stall after stall of kimchi sellers, a branch of Fauchon from Paris, and then there is the hot food section.  Heaven...!  For those of you, including, myself, who salivates over street food but can't quite work up the guts to indulge, the Lotte food court will satisfy your cravings.  Our favourite were the deep fried fish cake sausages (I am sure the Korean name for these are much more romantic...), with variations including a sesame leaf or seaweed wrap.  These were simply delicious.  Table real estate is scarce for the number of people wanting to eat, but we always ended up with a table, and we aren't very aggressive about this.  There are also non-street food options, such as sushi, fish, noodle, and rice bars.  You will eventually want to explore other food options, but if you are in the area this is a definite must see (and eat!!!)."
44,4.0,"This is your regular department store with all the American brands.  What we liked most was the Food Court.  A must go for at least one meal.  You can buy your food from anyone of the take out shops and eat in their lounge.  That means, if you are traveling with people that have different tastes, everyone will be happy.  During the weekday, we found they open at 10:00 a.m., the I went on a Saturday and they didn't open until 10:30 a.m.  You can take the Line 2 Blue to Euljiro1, exit 8."
