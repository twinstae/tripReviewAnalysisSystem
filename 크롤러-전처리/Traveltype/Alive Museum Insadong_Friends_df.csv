0,4.0,What a funny museum! A great way to trigger the creative mind! We had a great time being here and challenge our bodies in different positions!
1,5.0,"A very nice place to go with your friends ^^ gets really funny in some parts and even challenging, might get crowded on Sundays but still a fun way to spend time ðŸ˜Š"
2,3.0,The best part for me is the Alive cafe where you can seem like you are into a comics.  No actual food of course.Interesting place.
3,4.0,"Admission fee: 12,000 won (about $12)Subway Line 5 Jongno 3-ga Station exit 5Subway Line 1 Jongno 3-ga Station exit 1Subway Line 1 Jonggak Station exit 11Subway Line 3 Anguk Station exit 6House: 9am-8:30pmIf you love taking funny photos... this is the perfect place for you!!  This museum is one of the most recognized brands among attractions specializing in optical illusions. They even mark down the spot where you can stand to take the perfect pictures. Try to avoid weekends because ticket counter lines are super long. And always a wait to take pictures because too many people inside the museum."
4,5.0,"Ok, first off, Insadong is known for its korean traditional authenticity so I didn't have high hopes due to its location. However the place was amazing, better than it's counterpart too, my friends and I went in to escape the heat and came out flushed with excitement and our hearts pumping (you really need to do the dark experience, you can also opt out if you can't handle it but say so from the beginning). Would I go again? Hell yeah~~"
5,3.0,If u are into 3D pictures.. u might like this place.. But otherwise its not that special..Liked the different ideas but i believe it could have been better.. Specially with cleaning the area..  I bought the combined ticket for the maze and the alive meusum. . For 18k
6,4.0,The art pieces are somehow limited in comparison to the museums in other countries. Still a fun way to bond with friends and families. Recommended if you love taking pics or just having fun with friends. Otherwise you can skip this place...
7,4.0,"It is not hard to find, from Insadong station walk almost till the end. We got voucher for Alive Museum & Dynamic Maze. You can take a lot photos in it, some of it comes with instruction and some don't (you have to use your creativity then!). It takes around 1-2 hours for us to explore everything."

9,4.0,"Alive Museum is the 1st Brand of 3D (Trick Art) Museum of Korea. This branch is the Main & Biggest one. A lot of 3D painting here. Don't forget to try ""Dynamic Maze"" which is located in the same building.... very fun !!!"
10,3.0,"not all place have indication how to take the best picture, so most of the time we just guessing, this place also full with Chinese group tour, made the experience was not pleasant at all, not because of the place but because of the atmosphere and the people."
11,3.0,There were only limited instructions on how to position the camera. Some of the signage didn't make much sense at all. The place was a bit stuffy when I visited but it may be due to the number of people who were at the venue at the same time.
12,5.0,we went here with some friends and children; and had great fun clicking all kinds of wacky photographs. you just need to let your hair down and it will be a lot of fun ! our teens were initially a little hesitant since it was probably not cool enough; but finally they enjoyed it too
13,4.0,"We spent a longer time in this place then we anticipated.  It's a 4D photo backdrop place, where you can take MANY pictures....It was fun in the beginning, by the time we got to the 2nd floor, we were tired of taking pictures and sped through the rest of the backdrops. We visit Alive at around 5ish in the evening, there wasn't many people. It was fun and gives you something else to do, beside shopping."
14,4.0,"Went there with some friends and had so much fun. Recommend getting in at least 2 hours before it closes (8:30pm), because you will spend time there taking pictures. There are many couple oriented exhibits (some websites advertise it as a place for dating). Whatever the case, never go alone. If you have a Korean friend, ask him/her to look for admission tickets on flash sales websites (such as Tmon). As of Feb 23rd, 2015, there was a 30% off deal."
15,3.0,"Can be awesome if you have the right people with you, who are not ashamed of embarrassing themselves. +++++A lot of laughter ensured! (with the right people)+ Location is accessible if you are in insadong+ Price is not bad- The one in Hongdae is in my opinion a bit better. (therefore the rating ""Average"")- When I was there it was a bit too crowded."
16,4.0,It was indeed a great experience and fun to go to. Test your skills with the 3Ds and those hillarious pictures taken were worth the effort. Its value for money too as you'll get to enjoy the Ice Museum eventhough not much offered there.
17,2.0,"If you have to make a choice between the Trick eye museum vs Alive Museum, always choose the Trick eye museum.  (PS: Trick eye museum tickets also include the Ice Museum).  Perhaps only school children will enjoy the Alive Museum.  Found most of the pictures too artificial-looking and the effects not particularly inspiring."
18,5.0,I went there with my friends when we were in Seoul for travel. We had fun and we took a lot of pics with their cool artwork with funny pose. Love the red bean bread at the coffee shop in front the entrance. Hope we can visit there again next time.
19,5.0,"I went there with my friends. This is my first time visiting Korea and the 3D museum in Korea. It's much better than every 3D museum I've been through. There are many interesting and new innovations. It's very good for having fun with friends and family. Also, the place is located in the center of Insadong, which is one of the famous locations for tourists. I reckon everyone try visiting here. It's worth my money :)"
