0,1.0,Awful place. Art?? Really?? It is worth less than a Daiso..please avoid it! Staff is very unpolite and complacent
1,3.0,"Very disappointed in the Seoul Museum of Art -- but perhaps that was because so much of the space was usurped by a David Hockney exhibit. From the limited permanent exhibits we saw, this would not be on the ""must visit"" list for Seoul."
2,3.0,"I disagree with the last reviewer but not entirely. I thought that the reunification  exhibit lacked unity, sometimes lacked interpretability (in ODD abstract pieces paired with an OCCASIONAL lack of universal English descriptions, though ...there were for the most part). YET, I feel that the point of the (promoting) exhibition is for locals and that if it’s only purpose it to stimulate intrigue toward that agenda or some (active) empathy towards the suffering throngs in North Korea then I’m all for it. For me (anti-fascist plus overly) abstract installations that seemed tangential didn’t detract too much from it. Having said this as a way to show I was incline toward interest in the exhibits, I’d agree that some of the exhibits are more well crafted or ingenious than others. I like the sand painting video because o felt like the motion and temporality showed how history is shifting and therefore gave hope. And also the one pictured here suggesting the (visualized) possibility of the admittedly challenging reuni process by reference to/from Germany and pivot-compression muscle exercisers. Not a perfectly effective visual representation, but quirky/moving, like  a fair few other exhibits (Southern propaganda techniques, fish species variety in the river of the demilitarized zone, the train glass-bottle reuni song, photos of sports or other cooperation programs and the heart wrenching ones of divided North-South close families’ single instance and temporary reunions)."
3,5.0,The curation of the typography exhibition was second to none. An excellent and educational arrangement.
4,5.0,Innovative use of space. Interesting exhibitions. Free entry and certainly worth spending an hour or so.
5,3.0,"The Seoul Museum of Art (free entry) is modern art museum located behind the Deoksugung Palace grounds. Here you can explore several floors which six exhibition halls which feature the works of Korean and international artists works at various times throughout the year. Opening hours are from 10am to 6pm on weekdays and 10am to 8pm on weekends.   There is one permanent exhibition ""Chun Kyung Ja - Eternal Narcissist, where you can see a handful of works painted by this important Korean artist. During our visit we also found some of the works included in the third floor temporary exhibition - DigiFun Art: Urban Space (22 Sept- 13 Dec 13 2015) quite interesting to see. We also enjoyed the sculpture garden in front of the museum. These are quite photogenic, particularly during autumn foliage time of year. In the end, the Seoul Museum of Art might be a hit or miss for art fans. There are few exhibition halls and depending on the current exhibitions, there might or might not be much that meets your tastes for art. As such it is best to visit the museum website beforehand prior to deciding to include a visit here or not during your trip to Seoul."
6,3.0,We enjoyed the museum on a rainy day. Two displays by famous female Korean artists were enjoyable to look at. Lockers and a snack shop make this a nice indoor alternative when the weather is bad.
7,4.0,"I like cafeteria, inside this museum. very clear traffic line abut exhibition. good people."
8,2.0,"While the building looks quite impressive from the outside (as do the lovely statues in the museum's garden), the museum itself was literally empty and offered only one exhibition, which was a tiny room with some modern paintings.no photography is allowed in this tiny (and free) exhibition, which makes it even more forgettable than it already is.Skip this one."
9,4.0,"Tucked away next to the Seoul City Hall, this gallery had a lot of temporary space and only one or two semi-permanent gallaries. It focuses on modern art and what we saw was a lot of fun... A round up of local new artists. there were videos, installations, photos and mor tradition works.  Although this material will go, it gives a sense of what the gallery is likely to show.  Lots of kids, most of it free, a food outlet and easy access from City Hall metro.  This is a way of sampling Korean culture for Koreans."
