      "[0.9955956]   :    Due to time restraints I was only able to stop by for one of the guard-changing ceremonies, but wow! Highly recommended; it's a wonderful opportunity to take-in part of Seoul's rich history, and if you're able to actually go in and see the palace it will undoubtedly be worth it\n",
      "[0.99565375]   :    Probably a must see for every first time visitor to SeoulThe free tour was great 1330 and 3 or so other departured from the main gate The palace design is amazing\n",
      "[0.00425234]   :   A nice walk but not much to see or learn here\n",
      "[0.00428608]   :    But beware that you're only looking at the outside of a lot of buildings that to the untrained eye look very similar to one another\n",
      "[0.00448143]   :     Keep in mind if you’re expecting something similar to Buckingham Palace you may be mildly disappointed\n",
      "[0.00472698]   :   frankly i wasnt impressed much!If you skip it you wont miss much I think a visit to Seoul for any first timer is not complete without a stopover to this Grand Palace located in the heard of Seoul\n",
      "[0.00485554]   :     It really is a 5 star attraction; I am just not into this type of thing and would rather spend my time in a local neighbourhood hanging out which is why I gave it 4 stars\n",
      "[0.00633231]   :    I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view\n",

      "[0.9899928]   :    Took almost 3 hours to reach the peak from the main entrance with some photo stops along the way and another 3 hours down the same way\n",
      "[0.00776938]   :    I needed to queue for 20 mins just to take photos, as the short stretch to the summit is narrow and single lane\n",

      "[0.9938935]   :    Amazing cosmetics shops in the area, wonderful experience, need more than 3 hours to browse around\n",
      "[0.00151226]   :   There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style\n",
      "[0.00167143]   :    The other less popular markets and shopping streets are better so i'd skip this one if you are on a limited timetable or looking for something specific\n",
      "[0.00391024]   :    I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls\n",
      "[0.00450531]   :    It doesn’t seem to be too much different from any shopping thoroughfare anywhere else in the world - it could be Tokyo, New York, London or Beijing, were it not for the korean lettering everywhere\n",
      "[0.00566977]   :    That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long\n",
      "[0.00587264]   :     As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food\n",

      "[0.9932912]   :    A wonderful place to wander around a learn about the history of Korea\n",
      "[0.993306]   :    The whole site is amazing, but half a day is good enough then you can move on to one of the Hanok villages nearby so that you can have a good comparison of how the royalties and the the common people live their lives\n",
      "[0.00295857]   :    Its not really a Garden, but a Forest with some Pavillions, which could be a dissapointement if you are expecting a Garden like in the Forbidden City in Beijing\n",
      "[0.00446552]   :     The gardens themselves were pretty but what could have been done in 30 minutes max was dragged out to 60 minutes with lots of “have 15 minutes to look around” moments\n",
      "[0.00502315]   :    And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves (I was rewarded at Deoksugung), this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing\n",
      "[0.00526688]   :     A small palace, not really too much to see\n",
      "[0.00539926]   :    When you finish the tour the gate to Changgyeonggung is just on your left - not as interesting but worth a quick look if you have the palace pass\n",
